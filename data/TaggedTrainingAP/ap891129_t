<HEAD>Navy: Junior Officer's Errors Caused Destroyer Grounding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A junior officer who ignored advice from a lower-ranking navigator was to blame for the January grounding of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyer USS Spruance on a reef off the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report says. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Union </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> published the report Tuesday after obtaining it through a Freedom of Information Act request. The report contains the final results of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation `` The grounding of Spruance was not an act of God, was not due to equipment failure and was not the result of bad weather,'' the report said. `` It was caused by a combination of personnel errors and misjudgments which, when compressed into a short period of time, created a situation that put Spruance aground.'' Though the Mayport-based Spruance was performing maneuvers with another ship and a submarine, neither the ship's commanding officer nor the executive officer was on the bridge when the 7,800-ton ship hit bottom, the report said. Shortly after the accident, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> removed Cmdr. <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as the ship's skipper and reassigned the executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. J.M. <PERSON> Braeckel </PERSON>. The junior officer in command when the grounding occurred, Lt. W.T. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, was discharged from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The Spruance's hull, propellers, sonar dome and forward mast were damaged in the accident and required $ 1.4 million in repairs. The Spruance was preparing to join an anti-submarine warfare exercise with the guided-missile frigate <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> and the nuclear-powered submarine <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Andros </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> last Jan. 15. In the late evening, <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, in command on the bridge, ordered a series of course and speed changes to proceed with the rendezvous. The destroyer was just over a half-mile off the reef when the maneuvers began. When <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> considered a course change that would move the ship closer to the reef, the report said he was advised against it by Petty Officer 1st Class E.G. <PERSON> Yeargin </PERSON>, a quartermaster. Another officer, Lt. j.g. J.S. <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, agreed. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> ordered the course change but agreed to slow the ship to just over 3 mph. He then ignored four recommendations from <PERSON> Yeargin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> to change course to avoid the reef, according to the report. An officer and an enlisted man in the ship's combat information center then recommended another course change to expedite the rendezvous, but that would have led the ship `` directly through the shoal water,'' the report said. <PERSON> Yeargin </PERSON> objected and demanded a course change, but <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> ignored him again. Four minutes later, the ship ran aground. Among other findings, the report found that charts used aboard the Spruance had not been properly updated and reefs were not highlighted as they should have been. In addition, the report faulted the <LOCATION> Spruance </LOCATION>'s staff for failing to calculate the effects of rough seas on the ship at slow speeds.

 <PERSON> Kieko </PERSON> <PERSON> Hara </PERSON> has attended a `` cram school'' for months in a desperate effort to be ready for entrance exams. She's 5, and her parents hope <PERSON> Kieko </PERSON> will make it into a top-ranked private elementary school She attends cramming sessions twice a week after kindergarten and on weekends. Some days, <PERSON> Kieko </PERSON> makes rice balls or crafts, or is drilled in the Japanese alphabet. Once a week, she takes a practice test like those used by private schools to choose the few applicants they accept. `` We wish she did n't have to go to cram school, but if she gets into a good private ... system now, then she'll be able to enter the school's junior high automatically,'' said <PERSON> Yuko </PERSON>, her mother. Japanese public education is praised for egalitarianism and the high scores of students on achievement tests, but as public schools have become more equal, parents have sought an edge elsewhere. Children are being sent at ever-younger ages to cram schools, called jukus, or are going to private rather than public schools in hopes of gaining ground in the merciless college-entrance competition. The Education Ministry says 71 percent of elementary and junior high students attend jukus or have special outside lessons, in effect creating an entire second school system. It is a booming business estimated to be worth about 1 trillion yen, or $ 7 billion, a year. Some Japanese contend the increasing role of private spending in education threatens the equality of opportunity created by the public school system. Others feel public schools have concentrated on educating the mass of students, neglecting the bright and creative. Getting into the best schools frequently costs a staggering amount of money, as well as work. <PERSON> Kieko </PERSON>'s parents pay about 65,000 yen -LRB- $ 460 -RRB- a month for her juku classes in addition to fees for her private kindergarten. Some classmates began attending a juku at age 3, to prepare for the kindergarten entrance exam, and now have daily cram sessions before kindergarten and again in the afternoon. Such devotion to schooling has a long history in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and some other Asian nations, but the intense competition is largely a postwar development that grew with economic prosperity. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> spends less on public education than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, both in total amount and percentage of gross national product. In the last fiscal year, the government allocated 16 trillion yen -LRB- $ 112 billion -RRB- to public education, compared with $ 353 billion this year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. An Education Minstry study in 1987 said 4.2 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s GNP went to public education, compared with 4.8 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 4.4 percent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and 4.2 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Spending on education in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> varies greatly by school district and region, but <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has followed a policy of equal distribution of resources. It also does not `` track'' students, separating them according to ability. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the federal government provides about 6 percent of the public money for kindergarten through high school. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central government pays 43 percent, much of it in subsidies to local districts that reduce regional disparities to less than 20 percent, according to government figures. The Education Ministry approves textbooks and curricula, so all students study essentially the same material at the same time. In high school, Japanese students cram for college entrance exams that determine not only what schools they will attend, but their chances for a good job afterward. Companies with the most prestige usually hire graduates of only the top universities. College entrance exams have become more difficult as competition has intensified and frequently include material not covered in the public school curriculum, according to Education Ministry studies. With craming for exams now extending down to kindergarten, `` by junior high school many students feel their life has already been ordained,'' said <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON>, who has two children in school. In the past, a leading public high school was considered the best preparation for college entrance. That changed as the high schools became more equal. Many parents and students now see jukus, with their single-minded emphasis on preparing for exams, as more helpful than public schools in gaining admission to good universities. About 70 percent of parents in a recent survey said they disapproved of jukus, but most said they enrolled their children as `` a necessary evil.'' Other families try to get their children into top private kindergartens or elementary schools, especially those of respected private universities that automatically admit graduates of their own lower schools. The first year of <ORGANIZATION> Aoyama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s kindergarten, one of the most sought-after schools, costs about 1.4 million yen -LRB- $ 9,500 -RRB-, more than the 980,000-yen -LRB- $ 6,800 -RRB- for the first year of university. A survey by a major bank in 1987 found that education expenses account for 13.4 percent of after-tax earnings for an average Japanese family in a metropolitan area. That did not include salary forgone by the `` kyoiku mama,'' mothers who devote themselves to their children's education until the youngsters enter elementary school and for periods before entrance exams. `` For people without money and mothers who have to work, it's hard to get children into a good school,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON> said

 <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> does n't play up the milestone victories of two black candidates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, but he does share one strategy in his quest to become governor of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ he rarely mentions race. There's little doubt race will be a factor in many voters' minds next summer as they size up <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who is finishing eight years as <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s mayor. Some pundits already have predicted he will fail in his bid to become the state's first black governor. But others are talking about momentum from the successful campaigns of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov.-elect <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor-elect <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. Young is n't jumping on that bandwagon. `` I think it feels good to be a respectable candidate, and that's all I think I am at this point,'' he said. Young says he does n't have much in common with <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> `` other than the fact that we all went to the same college, <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and we all happen to have the same skin color.'' But lately, he has done at least one thing both <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> did: dismiss race as a factor. His campaign chairman is <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general and federal judge who is white and conservative. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general in <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s administration; <PERSON> Young </PERSON> was ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Young also is aggressively pursuing the white vote in mostly rural and conservative south <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, pushing his record for business development and economic expansion. His campaign manager is a white former small-town south <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> mayor, Hobby Stripling of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` I would suspect that the Young organization has been studying carefully the <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> campaign,'' said <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. But unlike <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> has stuck to his bent for the off-beat. His latest escapade came last week, when he ate dinner in a rustic juke joint where two racially offensive songs are featured on the jukebox. `` I'll go anywhere and talk to anybody,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` The world is made up of different people, and the only way we're going to survive is to learn to co-exist and respect one another.'' While there, he played down race in an obviously racially charged situation and took the opportunity to give the restaurant's owner a <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> record for the jukebox Political watchers say <PERSON> Young </PERSON> is taking pains to put himself forth as a racially palatable black candidate. `` The fact that <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> now has won shows it can be done. To that extent, it helps <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> be seen as a more credible and realistic candidate,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. `` It would have been a setback for Young's campaign if <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> had lost.'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said his campaign was successful because it appealed to mainstream values. Although his candidacy was closely watched by black leaders, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> deliberately kept liberal two-time presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at arms length and did not invite <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to campaign for him. Young also will not include <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in his campaign, <PERSON> Stripling </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We do n't have any plans to ask Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for any help,'' he said. `` Our campaign is a Georgia-based campaign, and we will handle it from within the state.'' Young was booed loudly by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters at the 1984 Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces, frustrated over their failure to win concessions from the <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> camp, yelled at Young when he rose to speak on behalf of a <LOCATION> Mondale </LOCATION> position. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> was stunned, his wife cried and a press aide collapsed. Still, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have remained cordial. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> political pollster <PERSON> Claibourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> predicts <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s campaign will be troubled by race, whether he likes it or not Young could come in first in the first round of the Democratic primary on the strength of his name recognition and the black vote; 24 percent of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s voting-age population is black, <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Young </PERSON> would n't get the 50 percent he would need to win, <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said. `` He will be in the runoff regardless'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said. `` But we are still at a place where a tremendous number of white people in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> are not willing to vote for a black candidate. `` It's not like <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. You're in the Deep South here, and the black population is significantly larger. That's unfortunately a pretty good correlation for prejudice. The larger the -LRB- minority -RRB- group, the more prejudice there is.'' Young, however, discounts that. `` I always felt that white folk in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> are way ahead of white folk in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> already,'' he said. `` I used to kid <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> that if he could get 30 percent of the white vote in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, I know I can get 45 or 50 in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>.'' In the Democratic primary, Young faces Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Zell </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, two powerful state legislators, Sen. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Bubba </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, and a wild-card entry, former Gov. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>. The front-runner for the Republican nomination is state Rep. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Isakson </PERSON>.

 An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent and a deputy prosecutor in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> were too late for the gold, but they get the glory. They have solved the mystery of the $ 500,000 Golden Horse treasure contest. Alone among the tens of thousands who sought the buried treasure, they deduced that the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> was buried in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, 10,400 feet above sea level, along the Continental Divide in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON>, who spent more than five years working separately on the puzzle, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday they had solved the riddle and the people who ran the contest do n't disagree. `` We have no comment about the site, but we will acknowledge and confirm that he's given us totally convincing proof that he found the exact location,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, president of D.L. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, said after speaking to <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, the national sales promotion company that oversaw the contest, has refused to divulge the solution. <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, 45, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent for 18 years, was the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s case agent for planning and security at the 1984 Olympic games. `` I know what it is to have a letdown after a long haul,'' <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and I are looking to see if we can find another good contest.'' <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON>, 44, a prosecutor for 16 years, said he was not drawn to working puzzles before the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> challenge, `` unless you count solving murders.'' The puzzle was offered to the public in 1984 as a story titled `` Treasure: In Search of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION>,'' which was released as a book, videotape and laser disc. The story contained arcane and complex clues to the puzzle. Contestants had until midnight of May 26 to find a statuette of a horse buried somewhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The horse was made of 2.2 pounds of pure gold and contained a key to a safe deposit box containing a 20-year annuity for $ 25,000 a year. The deadline passed with no claimant. As stipulated by the rules, the treasure was dug up and turned over to a charity _ Big <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sisters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> _ but the site was not revealed. Many frustrated treasure hunters who spent years, money and sweat on the puzzle clamored for the solution. Some maintained the contest was a fraud and that no trove was ever buried. <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and the authors of the story, bound by the contest rules, kept mum. `` I would love to have seen them retrieve this seven months ago, not only for their benefit but ours, so we would not have had to endure six months of slander,'' <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON> said. The partners wo n't reveal yet the step-by-step path that led them to <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>. That will come in an article they are preparing for publication in the March issue of Treasure magazine. `` You really ca n't work from the site backward,'' <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> said, `` because there's nothing that points to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>. You have to solve the ciphers to find it.'' <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> said the puzzle jelled on Nov. 1 and he and <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON> flew to the pass two days later to dig up whatever evidence of the stash remained. Amid snow, cold and gathering darkness, they missed the spot by 18 inches, <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> said. Returning to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the collaborators realized that they should have had a Polaroid camera with them to photograph the site and exactly align a landmark with a map from the book on which the spot was marked with an `` X.'' They returned on Nov. 18 and this time found proof positive that they were right. They dug up a vial containing a parchment that began: `` Dear seeker. Congratulations. Your travails are over,'' <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> said. They also found the remains of the crate that had contained the horse and a coat that the crate had been wrapped in, said <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>. Then, following instructions on the parchment, <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON> and read him a coded message: `` 165-69 INF.'' The code referred to the two numerical designators of <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>'s old <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> unit, the `` Fighting 69th'' infantry regiment.

<HEAD>Budgets Force Updates Rather Than Purchase of New Times</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The cost of new weapons and decreasing defense budgets are forcing more countries, including some <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members, to upgrade their armored vehicles rather than buy new ones, a new <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s yearbook said today. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries are concentrating their upgrading on improving fire control systems and providing an enhanced night vision capability, said the authors of the 1989-1990 edition of `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Armored Fighting Vehicle Systems. `` Few countries are at present installing new armament which is required to penetrate the latest Soviet MBTs -LRB- Main Battle Tanks -RRB- or to install more armor to increase their battlefield survivability,'' wrote <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Foss </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON> in the authoritative yearbook. They said the installation of a larger caliber gun and additional armor would in most cases overload the vehicles' suspension and reduce the power-to-weight ratio <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s next tank gun is likely to have a caliber of 140mm and be fed by an automatic loader that will enable the crew to be reduced to three, they said. The new gun could be mounted externally with the crew seated inside the hull. The authors said this provides a number of advantages, including a significant weight saving, as the turret on current main battle tanks can weight 20 tons. `` The weight saved could be used to make the vehicle more compact or to increase protection levels, especially against top attack weapons,'' the authors said. `` In addition, it would present an enemy with a much smaller target.'' The authors said much development work is taking place on conventional tank guns and ammunition, but `` there is little doubt that in the longer term the future is in other types of weapon systems for the main armament.'' Liquid propellant is the most likely route for artillery, they said. For the main battle tank, the electromagnetic or electrothermal gun is showing `` much promise.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the leader in both areas, they said, in the latter because of a spinoff from the Star Wars program, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.

<TEXT>
 By encouraging Eastern European allies who punched holes in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and sacked aging leaders, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is declaring the Cold War over and trying to ensure security in the new world to follow. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his top advisers believe the whole world, including post-war <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, has been changed forever by an explosion of technology mastered by the other side. Looking grimly at the backwardness of his own country and his neighbors, the breathtaking changes that have gripped <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this fall nevertheless offer <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> two opportunities: _ To renew and salvage at least part of a socialist system in which he sincerely believes, before stagnation and dissatisfaction blow the lid off. _ To achieve economic reform by redirecting his own economy away from the military and drawing the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> into the West's technological revolution Military security might be assured through economic interdependence that makes confrontation unprofitable. When he echoes the call of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> 21 years ago for socialism with a `` human face,'' _ <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s reform ground under the treads of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seems to aim at keeping half a loaf, rather than risking it all later in unpredictable fury. The move has won <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> respect in the West and support in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s non-Communist government has pledged support to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and continued friendship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. While acknowledging the West's technological superiority and economic might, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is far from declaring surrender in the Cold War. He and his advisers say they have a clearer idea of how to use Western muscle to build a new world. `` Politically the world has entered a new phase _ it is moving out of the Cold War into a period of peace,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in October. `` Today we need a consensus, an international approach to global problems _ not because it is a moral imperative, but for objective reasons, because the world is a single and interdependent whole,'' he said. In a world of buyers and sellers criss-crossed with satellite communications and computer technology, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sees his land that has been sealed off and content with the abacus as the ultimate loser. `` Now we have to make up for lost time, and this requires a more rapid pace of change,'' he said last week who asked about reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It also requires peace. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is cutting 500,000 men out of the armed forces, about half of them from Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Some missiles are being taken out of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The defense budget was cut 8.3 percent this year and defense factories are being retooled to make consumer goods. Negotiations continue on sharp cuts in strategic nuclear weapons, conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and chemical weapons. `` To put it in a nutshell, we need a normal external environment for our domestic work,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told former West German Chancellor <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> in October. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the czarist empire before it was fearful of a powerful <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the heart of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But the betting now appears to be that if <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is absorbed in being <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s rich uncle, it will have little incentive to rock the boat The area also may become an area of `` cooperation and understanding'' between the superpowers, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> said. Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, the former military chief of staff and a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> adviser, indicated in an article in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda that the army may consider a land buffer is less important now. What worries the Soviet military is being surrounded by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> firepower, <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 2 -LCB- times more large surface ships, 15 attack aircraft carriers to none for the Soviets, 2 -LCB- times more maritime aircraft and 19 times more Marines, he said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>, most likely, intends to continue using these forces to put pressure on us and threaten the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. If <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his advisers believe they have a clear idea of the future, they are concerned that short-term instability in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> could ruin it. `` Any deep changes, especially those in key regions of the world, are accompanied by instability and difficulties. This is only natural. The most dangerous thing at such moments is that someone may be tempted to use them for their own selfish interests,'' he said on Nov. 21. The Berlin Wall, however many holes it has, must remain standing for the time being, the Soviets say. Too much is changing in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the region to cope simultaneously with the elimination of the political structure that kept the peace, however tense, for more than 40 years. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s fear of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> spinning entirely out of control may be why he has so firmly supported reform in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> earlier this year just before authorities cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators and killed hundreds of them. An Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with no hope of catching up or enjoying the fruits of the West's technological revolution could be more likely to explode. Some reports in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> say orders to shoot at protesters had been given before <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was forced out by <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>. The alternative to reform _ tighter borders and more stagnation _ would mean abject defeat in the Cold War.

<DATELINE>OBSERVATION POST ALPHA, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>

 American soldiers who watch the East German frontier do n't relax their guard now that the barriers are down, but some have been deeply moved by the experience. `` At some points north and south of here, there were so many people coming across, it was like they were getting out of jail. It choked me up,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Sgt 1st Class <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Osterfeld </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said: `` The greatest thing in the world is to be a part of it. I was standing there when they tore a piece of this fence out a few miles away from here.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and Osterfeld are stationed with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at this post, which they call OP-Alpha, 75 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and a few feet from what used to be a heavily fortified border. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers say they have not relaxed, because increased Soviet helicopter patrols near the frontier show `` they're still there,'' but seeing the free flow of people across the line has been affecting. `` You did n't have to be at the border. You could go downtown and see those people buying things we take for granted, like fruit and coffee,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The 11th helps keep watch and gather intelligence through surveillance of Soviet-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact troops on the East German side. Officials say more than 380,000 Soviet soldiers are based in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. If an attack occurred, the 5,000-man regiment would try to delay it long enough for other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces to move up. Included in the unit's sector is the the <ORGANIZATION> Fulda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gap </ORGANIZATION>, a traditional wartime invasion route through central <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. For those who watch the 196-mile stretch of border, the dramatic relaxation of travel restrictions on the East Germans has not altered the routine very much. Osterfeld, 31, led a motorized patrol of men in green camouflage fatigues along the rusty 10-foot-tall steel mesh fences that mark the border near OP-Alpha. The soldiers, some armed with .45 - caliber pistols, others with M-16 rifles, sometimes patrol on foot, stopping to peer through binoculars into <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and reporting in by Since Nov. 9, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has opened 14 new crossings along the stretch of border guarded by 11th Armored Cavalry soldiers. There used to be only two. None of the crossings are visible from OP-Alpha, and the chilly landscape of hills and valleys 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION> is unchanged from before the dramatic changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. As American soldiers looked across the border with binoculars, East German guards could be seen in a watchtower 200 yards away, peering through their own binoculars at the GIs. Command Sgt. Maj. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON>, the outfit's ranking non-commissioned officer, said `` more than 100,000 well-equipped Soviet troops'' are stationed directly across from the Americans in central <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The Soviets have not shown a willingness to move back; that's why we're still here and ready to react,'' said <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Coburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` The East Germans who are coming here are welcome,'' he said, but `` we are still doing our job and our surveillance. <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said the Soviets appeared to have increased their air patrols along the border, using MI-24 attack helicopters for missions formerly flown primarily by East Germans in Polish-made resupply and observation choppers. `` We see about one a day, depending on weather and flying conditions,'' he said. `` I think it's their way of showing that they're still there and ready too.'' Over coffee in OP-Alpha's small dining hall, Sgt. <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornston </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said some rookies question why they still patrol a frontier millions of East Germans crossing freely. `` We now have to explain to our young guys, who have met some of these nice East German people, why we're still here,'' he said. `` The only thing I do n't feel good about is that all of them, even the bad ones looking for intelligence, also now have more free access.'' Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Torak </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Elkhart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said: `` We have to stay here, just in case'' the Soviets and their allies `` have n't put all their cards on the table. Now and then, an East German guard will wave at the Americans across the border, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said. Do they wave back? `` No,'' he said. `` They're still there, armed just like we are. Our guys ignore it and carry out their jobs like professionals.''

 The seven men were not priests or human rights campaigners, so their deaths have gone largely unnoticed. But according to relatives and neighbors, including a young man who barely escaped the slaughter, six of them were lined up against a peach-colored masonry wall and shot to death on Nov. 18. A seventh youth who happened upon the killings by chance also was slain. The relatives, neighbors and the young escapee all saw government soldiers a block away from the killing site in the poor suburb of <LOCATION> Cuscatancingo </LOCATION> minutes before the seven were slain. The young man said he heard the fatal gunshots while hiding from the soldiers. The dead were identified as <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zetino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Crespin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Medrano </PERSON>. The killings occurred two days after the slaying of six Jesuits, their cook and her daughter at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> killings, carried out by men who a survivor said wore military uniforms, stunned <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and caused an international outcry. There was no international outcry for the seven slain in <LOCATION> Cuscatancingo </LOCATION>. Spokesmen for the Salvadoran armed forces press office were unavailable for comment on the Cuscatancingo killings. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zetino </PERSON> was found `` with his social security card in his hand. He was still trying to identify himself when they shot him,'' said a neighbor, standing in front of the blood-spattered, bullet-riddled wall where the six bodies were found the morning of Nov. 19 in <LOCATION> Cuscatancingo </LOCATION> at the end of the dusty, partially cobbled <LOCATION> Pasaje </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gringo </LOCATION> _ `` <LOCATION> Gringo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Medrano </PERSON>, 14, was the only victim not from the neighborhood. His mother, <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON>, said he was there trying to buy bread. <PERSON> Medrano </PERSON> appears to have had the bad luck to stumble on the killings as they were being carried out, or just afterward. His body was found 10 yards away. Because his family did not have the $ 35 for a proper burial, he is the only one still buried at the end of the alley. Relatives and neighbors had buried the seven in a common grave at the end of the alley on Nov. 19, when much of the capital was still convulsed by the biggest guerrilla offensive of the 10-year-old civil war. The six local men were exhumed with approval of Justice of the Peace <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordoba </PERSON> on Nov. 23 and taken to cemeteries. `` They were not guerrillas,'' said the coach of the soccer team on which three of the slain men played. `` They had jobs, families. Everybody around here knew them. A guerrilla does n't have time to work, take care of his family and play soccer.'' Three of the six were day laborers. One worked at a glass factory and another at a brewery. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a 23-year-old illegal immigrant waiter in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, had arrived only two weeks earlier to visit friends from his neighborhood. Cuscatancingo, like other working class districts along the capital's northern fringe, was the scene of combat in the Nov. 11 offensive's first days. <PERSON> Pasaje </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Gringo </PERSON> had come through relatively unscathed, although fighting was more intense a few blocks away. Air force strafing and rocketing had come too close for comfort. `` We decided to evacuate,'' said <PERSON> Crespin </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>. `` But one always worries about leaving the house completely abandoned. So the guys decided to stay, to keep an eye on things, even though we begged them to come too.'' `` The muchachos -LRB- guerrillas -RRB- had come through a few days before. But we had no problem with them, and they did n't stop to stay here,'' said a neighbor. `` We were just sitting around, talking, when someone threw a rock at a dog in the street in front of us and made it bark and run,'' said the young man who escaped. For days he had refused to meet with any journalist and was only persuaded to tell his story after the strictest assurances, delivered through relatives, that he would not be identified. `` Here, out of fear, one abstains from saying important things,'' said a relative. `` Sooner or later, they catch up to you.'' `` The soldiers saw Oscar and yelled for him to come out into the street,'' said the young man who escaped the Cuscatancingo killings. `` He went out with his hands in the air, saying ` We're civilians. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> and I were sitting with our backs to the wall and they had n't seen us. I felt something bad was going to happen and said to him, ` Let's get out of here.' `` He said, ` We have n't done anything, so why should we run?' and stood up to take out his identification. The soldier in charge of the patrol swore at Oscar out in the street: ` You, SOB. What the hell are you doing here?' `` I stayed crouched down and took off along the wall and around the corner,'' he said. `` I ran a few blocks and hid. About 10 minutes later there was a long burst from an M-16. Then the coups de grace, one by one.'' <PERSON> Cordoba </PERSON> said: `` The only thing I can attest to is that the bodies of those seven were found at that place on that date, that six were exhumed on Nov. 23 and that they all died of bullet wounds.'' `` Who killed them, I do n't know,'' he said. <PERSON> Cordoba </PERSON> said he will send the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> his monthly report of all official business and the case will be pursued if an offended party, such as a relative, files a complaint, or if the attorney general's office decides it merits pursuit, even in the absence of a complaint. The attorney general's office would then make a preliminary investigation, which probably would include another exhumation and autopsies, and assign the case to a criminal court judge. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Josefina </PERSON> <PERSON> Crespin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>'s mother, continues to live in the green house next to her son's, the one whose facade served as the firing squad wall.

<HEAD>Despite Vasectomy, Man Fathers Triplets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Morter </PERSON> thought their family was complete after having three sons, so <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> had a vasectomy. Then came the Morters' daughters _ triplets. `` We just tell everybody we hoped and prayed for a little girl and we must have prayed too hard, because now we have three,'' said <PERSON> Morter </PERSON>, a technical sergeant stationed at <ORGANIZATION> Wright-Patterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. The Morters always wanted a girl. Their first-born was a boy, <PERSON> Jeffy </PERSON>. Then came <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON>, then <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>. The Morters decided three was enough, and in July 1987, while he was stationed in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the vasectomy was performed. <PERSON> Morter </PERSON>, 29, said a follow-up test performed by an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> surgeon confirmed that the vasectomy was successful. Then came <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, who celebrated their first birthday Nov. 19. Last year, before prescribing birth control pills as treatment for an ovarian cyst, Ms. <PERSON> Morter </PERSON>'s doctor gave her a routine pregnancy test, even though Mrs. <PERSON> Morter </PERSON> insisted she could n't possibly be expecting `` They said, ` Not only are you pregnant, you're very pregnant,''' <PERSON> Morter </PERSON> said. `` We did n't know what that meant.'' `` We found out, though,'' his wife said. After the pregnancy was confirmed, <PERSON> Morter </PERSON> had his vasectomy re-examined. A test showed that his sperm count was 30 percent of normal, instead of zero. Doctors are n't sure why the vasectomy failed, <PERSON> Morter </PERSON> said. `` They said they'd have to go back in and look,'' he said. He told them not to bother. After the triplets arrived, Mrs. <PERSON> Morter </PERSON>, 28, had her Fallopian tubes tied. Dr. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> urologist, said vasectomy failure is `` not very common at all. I've done them for 20 years and maybe one or two in all that time -LRB- has failed -RRB-. It's a very effective method of birth control.'' In <PERSON> Morter </PERSON>'s case, one of the tubes that carry the sperm from the testicles probably grew back together, <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 For the second night in a row, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> searchers spotted a flare Tuesday in their hunt for five lobsterman who disappeared a week ago off the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> coast. The sighting, about 250 miles south of <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION>, is in a remote area where <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> rescuers believe a life raft might have drifted. `` The flares are coming from somewhere,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` There are no other boats out there except the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We're going to search as long as there's a reasonable possibility that someone is alive and needs help,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannan </PERSON>. The 72-foot <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, out of <LOCATION> Stonington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was reported missing by its owner on Nov. 22. The boat's last transmission was the previous day, the same day officials received a distress signal. The jet that spotted the flare Tuesday night continued searching. Two Coast Guard cutters were also sent to the scene. A red flare had been spotted in the area Monday night. Both orange and red flares are used to signal an emergency, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. Flare lights last about two minutes. The jet that spotted the second emergency flare was due to return to land for refueling at about 10 p.m., <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. But a second aircraft was sent to the area to take its place. `` We're so far off shore that it's difficult,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. On Friday, rescuers turned up a floating radio beacon and fishing markers bearing the <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>'s name. The fishing boat was equipped with a life raft big enough for the entire crew. On Tuesday, three aircraft and two cutters searched an 8,000-square-mile area, some of which had been covered before. <PERSON> Brannan </PERSON> said the search concentrated around the area where a red flare was seen Monday night. Coast guard officials said the person who lit the flare could have been anywhere from 6 to 30 miles from where it was spotted. `` Where the flare was seen is where our trajectory was predicting the raft would be,'' <PERSON> Brannan </PERSON> said. The manufacturer of the boat's life raft told <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials that the craft contained three orange smoke flares, three red distress flares, plus an unspecified number of parachute flares, such as the one seen Monday. <PERSON> Brannan </PERSON> said she could not speculate about whether the crew members could survive a week at sea in the life raft. `` It depends _ were there provisions? Were they wearing survival suits?'' she said. The lobster boat carried survival suits for seven people. Seas last Tuesday were reported to be 26 feet high with wind gusts to 45 knots in the area where the <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> was lobstering. But fishermen in <LOCATION> Stonington </LOCATION> said it was not unusual for a boat to stay out in rough seas. `` That boat has weathered worse weather,'' said fisherman <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Babin </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Survey Of Americans And Japanese Finds Mutual Trust Flagging</HEAD>

 Japanese and Americans trust each other less and less and an increasing number are pessimistic about the relationship between their countries, according to a new poll. Japanese still trust the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> more than any other country, but <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ranks only No. 11 among countries Americans trust, according to the poll published Tuesday by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest daily newspaper. According to the survey, former Presidents <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have left strong impressions on many Japanese but nearly eight in 10 Americans can not name a single Japanese individual who has stuck in their minds. The poll was conducted by the paper <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> and the American Gallup polling organization. The <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> said 3,000 Japanese were surveyed in late September and 1,025 Americans in mid-October. A margin for error was not given. With trade tensions between the two countries on the rise, more Americans than ever before in annual poll's 11-year history called relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` bad.'' Among Americans, 9.3 percent said relations were bad, compared to 6.0 percent last year. Among Japanese, traditionally more pessimistic on the issue, 18.4 percent said relations were bad, slightly up from 17.5 percent in 1988. Many Americans still feel relations are `` good'' or `` very good'' _ 45.6 percent, compared to 38 percent of Japanese. Among the Japanese polled, just 31 percent believed relations will improve, compared to 52 percent of Americans. Only 15.1 percent of Americans named <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> among the five countries they most trusted, up slightly from last year but far below the 23.4 percent in 1984. Nearly 54 percent of Japanese said they trusted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, down from last year and lower than the 57.4 percent in 1984. Americans in the poll expressed the most trust for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Japanese gave top trustworthiness rankings to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Asked if their government should protect domestic industries by restricting imports, 66 percent of Americans said yes, compared to 43 percent of Japanese. On agriculture, 64 percent of Americans said their government should restrict imports, compared to 60 percent of Japanese. Both figures were up from last year. Among the Japanese polled, 82 percent said they would choose a domestically made product over an import, compared to 73 percent of the Americans. Asked to name a Japanese person who had made an impression on them, most of the Americans came up blank. The late Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was the most prominent Japanese in American minds, although he was named by just 6.6 percent of those polled. Next was <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Akio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>. Considered an unusually high-profile figure in Japanese business circles, he still left an impression on only 1.6 percent of the Americans polled. By contrast, 33.8 percent of Japanese said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> made an impression on them, followed by 23.3 percent for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and 17.0 percent for Gen. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>, who was supreme commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces occupying <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after World War II. Americans saw their own leaders somewhat as the Japanese did, ranking <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> highest, followed by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ranked eighth most impressive to Americans, and ninth to Japanese

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to reassure <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies Tuesday about his summit with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, promising `` I'm not going to surprise them'' with any agreement to cut nuclear weapons or reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops overseas. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may discuss possible military cutbacks `` in a general way'' when they meet off the coast of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> on Saturday and Sunday. But he added, `` In writing, I have made clear to Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> _ in my handwriting, so he knows it comes from me, not the bureaucracy _ that this is not a summit for arms control agreement.'' Meanwhile, budget constraints at home are forcing cuts in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed services _ whatever troop withdrawals are negotiated with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. As of Nov. 1, there were 2.13 million men and women in the armed services. The services have drafted plans for a reduction of 275,000, with about 135,000 to be trimmed from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, 100,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and 40,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, defense sources told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> will make a decision on the service chiefs' proposal when he returns Thursday from a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, and reports to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The sources, declining to be identified, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, the director of the presidential <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, was pushing for even deeper cuts in the armed forces. Pentagon officials recommended cutting 23,000 jobs involved in weapons procurement for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, according to a report in Wednesday's editions of The Washington Post. A final decision has not been made, but members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have complained that the cuts are aimed mainly at workers and field-level positions while not reducing the ranks of management. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it was very important for the allies to know `` I'm not going to go off and prematurely jump out there and try to grandstand by committing them to something. That's not the way you keep an alliance strong.'' After the two-day summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Dec. 4 to brief <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders on the discussions. The allies were aghast to learn in 1987 that then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had come close to a deal at a summit in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> to abolish all nuclear weapons in spite of the fact that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> regards some of those arms as vital to deter Soviet attack. Now, with the collapse of hard-line communist regimes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and massive budget deficits in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is considering major cutbacks in troops and weapons. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is facing similar pressures at home. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` There are no arms control proposals'' for the summit. `` So the surprise will be, if you're looking for a surprise, there wo n't be a surprise. That may come as a surprise,'' he said. He said there had been `` frantic speculation'' and `` hyped speculation'' that the superpowers would reach a deal on arms or troops. `` Now if we want to talk in a general way with the Soviet leaders about our aspirations for how a defense system will look 10 years from now, of course, we'll do that, we want to do that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In particular, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, he would like to talk with the Soviets about curtailing their defense spending. `` But that's not what I'm referring to when I talk about euphoric expectations of some deal,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` There is n't going to be such a deal It takes two to make a deal.'' Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has little interest in a possible <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal to restrict naval power. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a land power, would be less constrained by such proposals,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>. `` We are not aware of naval arms control measures that enhance stability.'' Despite criticism at home that he has reacted too cautiously to changes sweeping Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his approach was solidly supported by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. Saying he had consulted with each <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do n't want to sound self-centered here but almost every one of those leaders told me, ` We think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is handling this properly. We appreciate the way you're handling these changes, the prudent approach you are taking.''' Moreover, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, it should be the people of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> who lead the way toward change. `` It does n't come from somebody halfway across the world dictating how fast change should be or what change should encompass.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also promised that he would press <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the summit over the behavior of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Central American allies _ <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accuses of shipping Soviet-made weapons to leftist insurgents. The president said he was asked in a telephone call from Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> to ask <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to `` stop feeding <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> has spearheaded a drive for a regional peace accord in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the Soviets have not cut off arms deliveries to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` And as Mr. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said, there is one person most responsible for support of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- leftist rebels -RRB- to deny democracy to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, deny democracy to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and that is <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> mentioned Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> in the same connection.

<TEXT>
 It was to be a casual `` feet up'' meeting with neither expectations nor an agenda. But since this weekend's superpower summit was first announced, the White House is gradually defining items it expects to broach at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> The administration is seeking to shape an agenda that seems guaranteed to keep the feet of both <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders firmly planted _ even as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insists his shipboard summit with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will yield no deals and no surprises. `` So the surprise will be, if you're looking for a surprise, there wo n't be a surprise. That may come as a surprise,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> recently observed that the Soviets tend to overplay advance expectations for summits, Americans tend to minimize them; and that the truth lies somewhere in between. So, a week after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, audience the summit would be `` historic,'' the president complained to reporters during an Oval Office picture-taking session Tuesday about `` all kind of hyped speculation.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted he would cut no deals with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on arms control nor do anything else that would give allies pause. And he said the meeting remains `` without a fixed agenda.'' Still, in an effort not to be caught off-guard as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was at the 1987 Reagan-Gorbachev summit at <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been compiling a list of subjects that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is prepared to discuss. It also has suggested ground rules on how some of the subjects will be handled. That looks an awful lot like an agenda. For one thing, the president has made clear he will confront <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on the issue of continued Soviet bloc arms shipments to rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, by way of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The administration has said the continued shipments threaten improved U.S.-Soviet relations in other areas. `` I'm not the sort of man that will go there and not raise it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has vowed to `` seek his -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s -RRB- active cooperation in cleaning up the world's environment.'' `` A world solution can begin with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' the president told a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising audience several days ago. The unraveling of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s East European dominion, of course, will set the tone for the Bush-Gorbachev talks and dominate any agenda-setting efforts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he intends to discuss the upheaval in detail with the Soviet leader and will delve into such issues as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade with Soviet bloc nations. But he has been careful to assure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' European allies that he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will not discuss any future European boundaries, that the fate of Eastern bloc nations should be theirs alone to decide. White House officials also indicated this week that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is prepared to talk with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about arms reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, even though the administration earlier played down this aspect. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have suggested that the breakup of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact could provide a golden opportunity for deep cuts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense spending _ much of which is earmarked for waging a war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that `` certainly the two presidents in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> will talk about arms control and military force structure.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emphasized Tuesday that he would not `` enter into an arms control agreement'' at the summit, and would not catch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies off guard. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to brief allies in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> at the conclusion of the summit. If the low-key projections issuing from the White House this week follow an old mold for summitry, they also adhere to a pattern <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has set in his political life. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his lieutenants did their best to lower expectations about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1988 acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention; and yet the intensely practiced speech he gave was one that many analysts viewed as the best of his career. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp sought to play down expectations of the candidate's performance potential before both of his campaign debates with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. And, more recently, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his lieutenants voiced low expectations before May's <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> that the session would produce anything dramatic or lead to a resolution of the alliance's intramural dispute over short-range arms based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> produced a breakthrough compromise that unified <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> on the arms issue.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants assurances from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this weekend that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not exploit the Eastern European reform movement, say government officials who add the Soviet leader hopes for improved trade ties from the superpower summit. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also will be seeking progress on an array of arms control issues as he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hold their first summit Saturday and Sunday on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet warships in the waters off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. `` To put it in a nutshell, we need a normal external environment for our domestic work,'' says <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose economic restructuring program of perestroika has yet to produce measurable improvements in the daily life of Soviet citizens. The 58-year-old Soviet leader will be attending his sixth summit with an American president, and in circumstances that scarcely seemed imaginable a few weeks ago _ much less when he first sat down with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has encouraged and endorsed the political changes that have brought reformers to power in every Eastern bloc nation except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. But in the days leading up to the summit, he has spoken openly of fears that the West may try to exploit the situation. `` The most dangerous thing at such moments is that someone may become tempted to use them for their own selfish interests,'' he said recently. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed to reply in a speech on Nov. 22 in which he said, `` We will seek President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s assurance that this process of reform in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will continue. And we will give him our word that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> welcomes reform not as an adversary seeking advantage, but as a people offering support.'' There seems little doubt that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will underscore his commitment to reform. `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> observers say in jest that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will possibly carry to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on board the cruiser <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> a fragment of the ruined Iron Curtain,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Novisti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quipped. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> will no longer impose its views on its allies and may seek a pledge that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will not, for example, try the sort of end-run the Soviets staged by aiding <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. To bar potential unrest, the Soviets may even endorse massive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance; <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, for example, is seeking $ 1 billion in Western cash. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Thanksgiving eve invitation to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to end decades of East-West confrontation was seized on by the Soviets as proof the superpowers are on the threshold of a `` new stage of broad and open cooperation,'' in the words of <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>. The Soviets are writing a law allowing virtually unrestricted emigration of Jews and others that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants before recommending that the Soviets be granted `` most-favored nation status,'' to ease access of their goods to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> flushed with anger when asked whether the summit was called so the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> could seek <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for its shortage-plagued economy. `` It offends our national pride,'' he said. But pride or not, the Soviets want <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> know-how, computers and management techniques. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> says the Soviets want `` mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation.'' However, even if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agrees to loosen controls on high-tech exports and upgrade the Soviets' trading status, it's uncertain how much their state-run enterprises could benefit As of now, they can offer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers only `` petroleum and vodka and caviar and not much else,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>. Arms control _ the centerpiece of past summits _ is now overshadowed by the momentous changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. For Soviets, however, weapons cuts would be tangible proof that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` new thinking'' is paying off. The Soviet ideal, says <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kremenyuk </PERSON>, would be a timetable fixing goals for the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks on strategic weapons cuts and the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> negotiations on conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kremenyuk </PERSON> is the deputy chief of a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> think tank studying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At the last round of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, `` the two sides' approaches were so far apart that no convergence was discernible,'' Novisti charged in frustration. The Soviets cleared the way for progress by dropping their condition that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> agree not to deploy the Strategic Defense Initiative, and now are hinting <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> could break remaining logjams. <PERSON> Kremenyuk </PERSON> said the Soviets want the 30 percent to 50 percent cuts in superpower arsenals envisaged by the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, plus a cooling-off of regional conflicts like <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, so they can shift more resources to the civilian economy.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, while telling a Poland-bound delegation of prominent Americans `` dollars alone wo n't make the difference,'' is sending nearly $ 1 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used a Tuesday evening sendoff reception for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission to sign legislation providing $ 938 million for the two East bloc nations over the next three years. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who heads the mission, said he will announce a new $ 20 million installment in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food aid on Thursday in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the presidential panel, as it prepared to leave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on its four-day tour of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, that it should give him an initial report by phone while he is in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> this weekend for his shipboard summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` I want to know how this goes. I'd like to hear it there, in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. It will give me flexibility in my talks with the general secretary,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said the upheavals sweeping <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and other Soviet bloc nations would be `` high on our agenda'' at the summit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the legislation, which provides more aid than he had sought, at a reception for the presidential mission at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the official guest residence across the street from the White House. The mission left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later Tuesday night and was to return on Saturday. The legislation, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called `` a major and positive step in bipartisan foreign policy,'' includes programs for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with a value of $ 846.5 million. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would receive benefits with a total value of $ 91.5 million. He said both nations had `` stirred the imagination of the world.'' `` We are nearing the end of a year that future generations will remember as a watershed, a year when the human spirit was lifted and spurred on by the bold and courageous actions of two great peoples, the people of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. However, he said that `` we've got to recognize the fact that dollars alone wo n't make the difference.'' He said the `` economic miracle'' of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> came only after `` full engagement of our private sector in shaping the free market system that has generated unprecedented prosperity across <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' `` That lesson holds true for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> today,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued. `` Our aid must be seen as seed money for free market reform and for the involvement of our private sector.'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., chief sponsor of the <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> aid bill, said in a statement after the bill-signing, `` Now we're a partner with the forces of freedom in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> We're giving Solidarity a fighting chance to succeed.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> voiced some pessimism on short-term prospects for improved conditions either in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or in its fast-changing East bloc neighbors. `` Economic reform is not an overnight proposition. It will take time. It would be tragic indeed if all the magnificent emotion of the moment is channeled into frustration,'' he told a White House news briefing. The delegation includes <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> and 20 representatives of business, labor and academia. Another two dozen government officials also were expected to accompany the delegation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> named the delegation last month to `` focus on those economic sectors where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expertise and experience can be of greatest assistance.'' He said other missions, targeting more specific areas, would follow. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who with her husband <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in August, predicted a period of `` some pain'' as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> moves from a state-owned economy to a market economy. `` There'll be a loss of jobs for some people. Also, as subsidies are removed from certain areas, there will be an increase in prices,'' the labor secretary said. She said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government could help the new Solidarity-led government ease the pain by establishing some form of social safety net to `` help workers make it through the inevitable dislocations.''

<HEAD>Reduced Use of Chlorofluorocarbons in '70s Slowed Global Heating:
Expert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The major climate changes that may result from global warming are being delayed by 20 years due to less use of chlorofluorocarbon gases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> scientist says. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, a researcher at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said that chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, make up about 25 percent of the so-called `` greenhouse gases'' thought to be causing the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> to slowly heat up. But if production of CFCs had not been reduced in 1974, he said Tuesday, the compound by now would have made up more than half of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the planet would be heating faster. `` If the growth of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production in the early 1970s had continued to date,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> says in a paper published in <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, `` the CFCs would now cause a much larger greenhouse effect, greater than that for CO2 -LRB- carbon dioxide -RRB-.'' In an interview, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said that with an unchecked use of CFCs, `` we would get to the large climate changes caused by greenhouse forcing -LRB- or heating -RRB- in 20 years rather than in 40 years as most models -LRB- theories -RRB- now predict. The CFCs would provide a forcing at least as large as CO2.'' The greenhouse heating effect of CFCs would be three times larger now if production of the chemical had not been reduced in the 1970s, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. CFCs once were used as a propellant in cans of such products as hair spray, paint and household cleaners. When studies showed that the chemical compound could harm the atmosphere, the use of CFCs as a propellant was stopped in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and in some <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries. Starting in 1974, there was a sharp reduction in the production of CFCs. The chemical, however, continues to be used as a refrigerant and in some industrial applications. In addition to contributing to the greenhouse heating of the atmosphere, some CFCs also cause a depletion in the ozone layer of the stratosphere. High level ozone blocks solar ultraviolet rays, a principle cause of skin cancer. As a result of this ozone problem, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and some other nations have agreed to stop production of some CFCs in the 1990s and to develop other chemical compounds to use as refrigerants. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said that manmade gases, principally carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere are thought to have caused the Earth to retain an additional 2 watts of heat energy per square meter since 1890. He and other scientists predict that this heat retention will increase to about 4 watts per square meter in about four decades if the rate of carbon dioxide dumped into the atmosphere by human activities continues at its present, increasing rate. Exactly how and when this will affect the Earth's temperature is a matter of controversy, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said, `` because of the uncertainty in climate sensitivity.'' But some experts have expressed fears that increasing the temperature of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> by only a few degrees could force a rise in ocean levels and seriously affect food production by changing the climate in major farm areas. The greenhouse effect is caused by atmospheric gases that act rather like a blanket by keeping heat from radiating from the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> into space. This could gradually force the globe to warm. Carbon dioxide, the principle greenhouse gas, is produced by combustion, such as in the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood.

<HEAD>Investigation Planned Into Handling of Barry Drug Allegation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> investigators plan to question police officials who in 1983 reviewed allegations that Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was hospitalized for drug overdoses, a published report says. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> released a statement Tuesday night calling the allegations `` outrageous'' and adding, `` I went to the hospital because I had a sharp pain across my chest ... I was n't using illegal drugs then or at any other time.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> today quoted unnamed police sources as saying that Police Chief <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has ordered an internal investigation into the handling of the allegations. <ORGANIZATION> WUSA-TV </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was hospitalized for cocaine overdoses at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, according to allegations made to police nine months later by Dr. <PERSON> Alyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gullattee </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> drug abuse specialist. On Tuesday, former police chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gullattee </PERSON> came to him with the allegations and he turned them over to the department's Internal Affairs Division, which was then unable to verify her account. `` Basically the investigation revealed it was unsubstantiated allegations,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a Republican who is an unannounced candidate for mayor in next year's election. Turner confirmed that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was not treated by <PERSON> Gullattee </PERSON> in either instance. He also said <PERSON> Gullattee </PERSON>'s information came from her patients and she had no firsthand knowledge of the mayor's medical treatment. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a physician who was then the director of the <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency room, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> underwent a checkup for several hours before he was released and was told to take it easy. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who supervised <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s care, said there was no indication that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> had been using drugs. Turner scoffed at suggestions that either he or the police officers handling the case might have muddled the investigation to protect the mayor. `` Why waste 32 years -LRB- on the police force -RRB- to cover up something like this?'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> WRC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's just not worth it.'' At the time, officials said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> had been hospitalized for flareups of a hiatal hernia problem. A spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office said Tuesday there was insufficient evidence to open an investigation. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s activities already are under federal grand jury investigation in connection with convicted drug dealer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who said in open court that he bought drugs for <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said he has known <PERSON> Gullattee </PERSON> for about 12 years. He told <ORGANIZATION> WUSA-TV </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that she told police investigators she knew a 7-year-old boy who was a drug addict. That story was the subject of a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> article by <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, which won a 1981 Pulitzer Prize. The newspaper was forced to return the award when <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> admitted that the boy was fictional. Police `` exhausted a lot of resources'' trying to find the boy, whom <PERSON> Gullattee </PERSON> said she knew, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Gullattee </PERSON> did not return several telephone calls to her office on Tuesday.

Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> ruled Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> J2 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has first right of refusal for distribution of `` Dorf'' videos only when they are produced by <ORGANIZATION> Longshot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> is the majority owner. <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> cited a contract between J2 and <LOCATION> Longshot </LOCATION>, which began producing the `` Dorf'' series in 1986. <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>'s costumed character, <PERSON> Derk </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorf </PERSON>, is supposed to be 4 feet tall. J2 distributed the first three `` Dorf'' videos, `` <PERSON> Dorf </PERSON> on Golf,'' `` <PERSON> Dorf </PERSON> and the First Games of Mt. Olympus'' and `` <PERSON> Dorf </PERSON>'s Golf Bible. <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said the story idea and production of the new `` <PERSON> Dorf </PERSON> Goes Auto Racing'' came from <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, so the distribution contract between J2 and Longshot does not apply. J2 filed suit Nov. 8 against <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> and Longshot, alleging breach of contract and good faith. The next day, <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> temporarily barred distribution of `` Dorf Goes Auto Racing,'' which had been scheduled for release Nov. 15. Liaison attorney <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Drooz </PERSON> said the company now will negotiate with its sponsors for a new release date.

<HEAD>Report: Some Farm Operators Collecting Subsidies in Excess of Limits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s watchdog agency says some big farm operators are still collecting crop subsidies in excess of limits set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> In one case, the department's Office of Inspector General said Tuesday, a single farm operation collected about $ 2.8 million in subsidies, 56 times the $ 50,000 limit set by law. The report did not identify the recipient of the huge payment, and inspector general officials refused to provide further details. However, the report's appendix showed a `` maximum payment limitation'' for <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, with an audit figure of $ 2,867,614 in `` questioned costs and loans.'' The entry also showed that $ 2,788,077 of the total as `` unsupported costs and loans'' by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that handles commodity subsidy programs. Other areas of abuse also were cited in the agency's semiannual report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on investigative and audit activities during the six months that ended Sept. 30. Those abuses included crop insurance overpayments, loopholes in debt restructuring by the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and flaws in the export subsidy program. By law, the crop subsidies, called `` deficiency payments,'' are not supposed to exceed $ 50,000 per person per year. These are direct payments to help make up the difference between depressed market prices and higher `` target'' prices set by the government. For example, last month the price of corn at the farm was $ 2.20 a bushel. The target price for 1989 corn is $ 2.84. A `` person'' can be an individual, a joint stock company, a corporation, an association, a trust or some other legal entity. The report said `` abuses in the program continued'' despite efforts by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1987 Omnibus Reconciliation Act to close loopholes. Overall, in 1987, an estimated $ 66 million was paid to farmers who dodged the $ 50,000 limitation. Investigators have found that big operators often reorganize to qualify additional `` persons'' for the purpose of collecting larger payments. In one case, an individual used relatives, employees and business associates as `` persons'' under the program, the report said. Those totaled at least 21 in 1986 and 29 in 1987. Payments totaled about $ 2.8 million for the two years, plus more in 1988 and 1989, which are under review by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have recommended that <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> improve its review procedures and withhold 1989 payments until final eligibility is determined,'' the report said. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said of the report: `` Outrageous payments such as these undermine public support for farmers A few bad apples are giving all farmers a bad name.'' A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, said loopholes are `` something we've been concerned about'' for a long time. `` We end up with subsidies going to all types of corporations and corporate investors,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. `` We have long advocated targeting those payments to family sized operations.'' Other findings of the inspector general's report included: _ Loss adjustment errors by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and reinsured private companies resulted in overpayments estimated at $ 91 million out of $ 716 million paid out in claims Underpayments totaled $ 1.6 million. _ Under <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> debt-restructuring procedures, borrowers were able to sell off security property and still qualify for `` buyout'' benefits Buyouts allow borrowers to have debts written off by <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> after buying back the note at 30 cents on the dollar, based on the value of the remaining property held as collateral. `` For example, one borrower improperly disposed of a portion of collateral securing outstanding debt totaling $ 160,000,'' the report said. `` However, since the borrower qualified for the buyout, <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> allowed the borrower to buyout the debt for about 30 cents on the dollar, a loss to the government of $ 112,000.'' The report recommended <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> seek legislation that would deny a `` buyout'' to anyone who demonstrated a lack of good faith under the debt-restructuring program. _ Subsidized sales of farm commodities to designated foreign countries are provided under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP Private exporting companies collect the subsidies, or bonuses, in the form of surplus commodities held by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> The subsidies enable the exporters to charge foreign customers lower prices than otherwise would be the case. That enables <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products to compete in overseas markets with other suppliers, notably the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, which has export subsidy programs of its own. But investigators said they found that `` some countries in the program do not show strong competition with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. commodities.'' Overall, the report questioned <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> bonus payments of $ 151 million for transportation costs, which `` may not be allowed'' by federal law, and payments of $ 89.8 million that resulted from `` a possible miscalculation of world prices.''

 The actor stuck out his chin, pursed his lips and flipped his wrist in a questioning gesture _ and the laughter that exploded from the disbelieving audience proved everyone knew who he was supposed to be. Only one person, a young woman in third row center at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Satire Theater, bent her head and appeared more traumatized than amused by the parody of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> She was his daughter, <PERSON> Irina </PERSON>. Clearly upset, she left Friday night's performance of emigre writer <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>'s courtroom comedy, `` The Tribunal,'' before the curtain call. But if she could not laugh at her father, the rest of the audience could, in a way they could never publicly laugh at a Soviet leader before. In one of the ironies of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or greater openness, he has become the butt of jokes by a growing group of fearless comics, who once could not have dreamed of mocking the country's leader _ at least not in public and not while he was alive. `` The Tribunal'' is not especially biting. The new `` court chairman,'' played by <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Bezrukov </PERSON>, speaks with a southern Russian accent that turns g's into h's, darts his eyes constantly, and proposes a commission as the best solution to festering injustice. The light mockery would roll off the back of a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> leader accustomed to unflattering caricatures and tasteless scatalogical jokes. But it is still scandalous in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Even the outspoken host of one of Soviet television's most daring programs, `` Vzglyad,'' or Glance, said in a recent broadcast that when he heard a mild joke about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on the nightly news, `` my heart jumped.'' `` It's hard to get used to relating to state leaders without standing at attention,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> said. The broadcast featured <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> comic <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Grushevsky </PERSON>, who performed a telephone imitation of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that captured not only his throaty timbre and homey style but his habit of speaking in fits and starts and veering off from phrases before finishing them. `` Telephone is not the best way to communicate,'' <PERSON> Grushevsky </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` Although, you know, sometimes it's also a way to solve some kind of knotty problem and some, so to speak, to move ahead ...'' <PERSON> Grushevsky </PERSON> said his audiences seem to laugh partly because they are so unaccustomed to hearing the voices of political leaders coming from the stage. `` And some laughter comes from relief, that it's OK, that the concert is going on and no one will come afterward and take me away,'' he told <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON>. `` Now people have started to get used to it, and thank <PERSON> God </PERSON> for that.'' The Satire Theater's 80-year-old artistic director, <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pluchek </PERSON>, said authorities have closed him down often in the past when shows were too politically salty, but he did n't expect that kind of trouble any longer. `` That's all over,'' <PERSON> Pluchek </PERSON> said after Friday's performance of `` The Tribunal.'' Told that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s daughter was in the audience, <PERSON> Pluchek </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Zinaida </PERSON>, warned, `` Now Papa will come and forbid it. But <PERSON> Pluchek </PERSON> dismissed her worries. `` He should n't be offended,'' he said. `` We respect him. In a democratic society, an artist should have the right to make a friendly caricature of the leader.'' Several days later, the theater director, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinsky </PERSON>, said he had not received any reprimands from above. Not all imitations are quite so innocuous. Another <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> comic, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Zadornov </PERSON>, does a routine that appears to highlight the Soviet leader's occasional lapses in grammar and speech. `` Comrades, comrades, comrades,'' he said in a recent performance. `` Despite this responsible speech I will speak without a little paper. Yes, I'll give you all a lesson on literate speaking. I will, I will, yes.'' The speech that follows contains a variety of exaggerated grammatical errors and malapropisms typical of uneducated Russians and includes a pledge that `` We wo n't let just anyone who wants to dirty up our mother tongue, we have our head behind our shoulders.'' For all the public parodies, many jokes about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> still have not made their way onto the airwaves or into print. When he first came to power in 1985 and introduced an anti-alcohol campaign, wits turned his title of `` General Secretary'' into `` Mineral Secretary'' _ a reference to the mineral water resorted to by drinkers deprived of wine and vodka. Many jokes have focused on his close relationship with his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, portraying her as ever-present and domineering. An anecdote now making the rounds in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has a well-known psychic thrown into prison because he made <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s hair grow out and cover his birthmark, and `` now he can only be recognized because his wife is with him.'' Far more devastating anecdotes abounded about former leaders but circulated only by word-of-mouth or in emigre publications. `` The Tribunal'' broke new ground in its public mockery of past leaders as well, such as <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and other members of the pre-Gorbachev gerontocracy. It depicts <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> as a doddering, senile old man who unzips his pants near a marble statue because he ca n't distinguish it from a urinal.

 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> says he'll be looking for ways to make <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> a paying customer for American goods as he leads an economic assistance mission there this week. `` A lot of the focus on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has been on aid and assistance,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` But that kind of help is transitory.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation arriving in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> today will look for ways to keep the country from becoming overly dependent on others, said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, adding that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> should be helped to `` stand on its own two feet.'' If all goes well, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries that are opening to the West will be better customers, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has approved a $ 533 million aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, $ 125 million of which is food aid. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s remarks came at Outlook'90, an annual conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to examine farm policies and factors that affect them. He left Tuesday night for four days in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with a delegation of 20 private-sector representatives, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, who also spoke at the conference, was asked if the changes in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc will affect the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a $ 5 trillion economy with a very small amount of trade with <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said. `` We believe we will be able to help with restructuring their economies.'' He said the outlook for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy was strong, predicting that interest rates would decrease, thereby helping the agricultural sector. Questions also were raised about progress of international trade talks, known as <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had submitted its final proposal and received positive reaction, except from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. However, he said that did n't bother him because he expected the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would reject the European proposals as well. He said a negotiated agreement would be reached eventually. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> emphasized that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not trying to remove all subsidies internationally. `` The question is how those supports are designed,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` They ought to be designed to minimize distortions in trade.'' <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was working to open roadblocks to free trade worldwide. In response to a question, she criticized <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for its closed trade policies. `` No one has gained so much from an open market system as the Japanese,'' <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said. She praised <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s expertise in exporting and investing, but said other countries could begin to shut out <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> if it does n't increase its imports As for the effect of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> on the 1990 farm bill, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and two members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said legislation could be passed and then revised to accommodate agreements stemming from the trade talks. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, R-Ill., said that while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would not be willing to change its subsidy policies without reciprocation, it might pass legislation calling for adjustments `` if other countries were to embrace the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal'' at <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> `` It remains to be seen what we are handed after the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> talks,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he did n't think <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' debate on the 1990 farm bill would effect the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> talks. `` I see it working out just fine as long as <LOCATION> Ambassador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> can convince our trading partners we can take back the agreement and get it approved -LRB- by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, a paper presented at the conference predicted next year's food prices would rise at a slower pace as farmers continue expanding crop production. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said record meat production, bigger crops and slowing inflation will hold the retail food prices increase to 3 percent to 5 percent. Food prices this year are rising nearly 6 percent, the sharpest annual increase since 1981. Part of the reason for this year's runup _ prices gained 4.1 percent on the average in 1988 _ were the lingering effects of last year's drought `` World crop production is recovering from last year's reduced level,'' he said. `` But for most crops, production -LRB- in 1989 -RRB- will not match continued high levels of use.'' Next year, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> said, world commodity consumption will reach a record level `` in response to larger output, continued economic expansion and population growth.''

<HEAD>GAO Study Says Base Closings Won't Save As Much As Expected</HEAD>

 The government wo n't realize as much as originally estimated in annual savings from closing or realigning 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases, a lawmaker says. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that a study by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> found that the shutdown or scaling back of 15 bases will result in $ 453 million in savings instead of the $ 622 million per year estimated by a federal commission. Among the bases are Fort Dix in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chanute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and the Presidio in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was scheduled to release the report today. `` The incredible fact of the matter is that we are even farther away from realizing the $ 2 billion to $ 5 billion a year that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was looking for when it started this base closing process,'' <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON> said in a statement. Overall, the congressionally established Commission on Base Realignment and Closure recommended in January closing 86 military bases and scaling back five more, a proposal accepted by then-Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly backed the plan but a handful of lawmakers complained that the commission had used faulty data in the cases of some of the bases. The closings and realignments are to be completed by Sept. 30, 1995. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> this summer to determine the cost and long-term savings of closing or realigning 15 of the bases and moving military personnel. Congressional efforts to stop the closings if the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found that the savings will not exceed the shutdown costs failed. <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON>, whose district includes <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> determined that the elimination of basic and advanced training at the base will result in only half of the $ 84.5 million savings estimated by the commission. He also said that the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found that the changes at the base would eliminate only 54 percent of the 2,167 jobs projected by the commission. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION> will lose 613 military personnel, not the 1,306 originally estimated, and 554 civilian jobs, instead of the 861 anticipated by the commission, <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON> quoted the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> as saying. `` To the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s credit, it has been able to account for some savings of taxpayers' dollars from the realignment of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON> said, noting, however, that the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study underscored his contention that earlier estimates were flawed. `` The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s work indicates that inaccurate data was used and that personnel cuts and savings were grossly exaggerated,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Flood </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> `` stands by the work that was done'' by the commission. `` The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> had pretty much already hinted that their report would say something like that,'' Flood said. `` There was more than one criterion that the commission looked at, not just the payback in savings. We looked at many different things.'' The 15 bases are the Presidio, <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, Mather Air Force Base, <ORGANIZATION> Norton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and Hunters Point Naval Station, all in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Pease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sheridan </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chanute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>; Jefferson Proving Ground in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lexington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meade </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holabird </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Devens </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.

 Government civil rights officials say they will respond by mid-December to complaints that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is not committed to ensuring equal education opportunities. `` I come here proud of this record,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, temporary head of the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights efforts, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. `` I believe that -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has done a good job of enforcing these civil rights statutes and ensuring an equal educational opportunity for all Americans.'' But <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> conceded that he had failed to respond to committee queries, some dating to late October. He promised written responses by Dec. 16. `` After almost one year in office, there seem to have been no substantive efforts to improve the Office of Civil Right's dismal enforcement record, and there has not even been a nomination for permanent assistant secretaries of civil rights enforcement in either the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Major </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, D-N.Y. Members of the committee cited a year-old staff report that found `` an apparently deliberate and very effective system'' by which civil rights laws were not enforced. Although the reporting period was during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, panel members insisted the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had done little to correct the situation. `` Apparently ensuring equal education opportunity for all <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children is not very high on our education president's list of priorities,'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said `` Many black people and organizations have given up on <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I have personally encountered individuals who believe that it would be pointless to file a ... complaint against their school system because <ORGANIZATION> OCR </ORGANIZATION> would not do anything to correct the violations or because doing so would subject black school officials to retaliation,'' she said. According to the report issued last December by the committee's Democratic staff, 58 percent of investigations closed between fiscal years 1983 and 1988 were concluded with a finding of `` no violation. Between 1981-1988, the civil rights office initiated 9,768 complaint investigations, the majority of which related to handicap discrimination. Only 15 percent of the complaints involved allegations of race discrimination, 17 percent related to gender discrimination and 3 percent to national origin discrimination. The report also pointed to major cuts in budget and staff for civil rights activities, and to `` confused policy directives, administration mismanagement, numerous changes in leadership and severe reductions in resources.'' `` In recent years, we have been in the vanguard in our efforts to eliminate dual systems of higher education,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, temporary head of the civil rights division at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Committee members were not impressed. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, D-Ill., said that all three major higher education cases handled by the departments are still pending `` One of the best defenses that this nation can ever have is not found in whether or not we can explore the outer space or build a new bomber but in whether or not we can educate our young irrespective of their race, creed, color or sex or financial status,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., said he was disappointed in the agencies `` You seem to be proud of your record,'' he said. `` I have n't read any report that commends you or says that you're doing a good job You seem to be operating on the theory that you can do more with less, which is a lot of baloney. You know that. It's nothing but double talk.''

<HEAD>Critics Praise Kohl's Vision of One Germany, But East German Leaders

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> dazzled his countrymen with his vision of a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> within a united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s leaders apparently see <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s ideas as something of a Trojan Horse laden with suspicious cargo. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Tuesday outlined a 10-point plan to gradually unite the two German states, saying he wants reunification but acknowledging it could take time. The chancellor wrapped his ideas into a far-reaching concept of overcoming the overall divisions of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, stepping up disarmament and forging closer links between the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s proposals are specific in some areas but appear general enough to save him from criticism at home that he is being too meddlesome in East German domestic affairs. His speech is already being hailed as probably the greatest of his political career, even by some usually severe critics. `` During <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s years in office, seldom has there been the opportunity to praise the chancellor for a speech,'' the newspaper <PERSON> Stuttgarter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nachtrichten </PERSON> said in a commentary today. But the newspaper said of Tuesday's address to Parliament: `` <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has given an important speech, if not a historic one.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s speech even won praise from opposition politicians who have steadfastly maintained in recent weeks that while <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was falling apart, the chancellor has been too slow in producing needed assistance for the embattled Communist neighbor. <PERSON> Hans-Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s arch foe as head of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, presented his own plan for closer ties with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. It had much in common with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s. The chief difference was, <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> spoke out for a loose German confederation and said nothing about formal reunification. <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Voigt </PERSON>, an important Social Democrat lawmaker, said he agrees with the chancellor `` on all 10 points'' and offered to help fulfill them. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Voigt </PERSON> cautioned <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> against telling the East Germans what sort of future they should choose for their country. Even though <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> made it clear he still wants formal German reunification at some point, his vagueness on what he foresees in the short-term has annoyed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Communist leaders. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> proposed that the two German states set up `` confederative structures'' such as joint government bodies for regular consultations. East Germans might be interested in a confederation if it ensures their country would not be swallowed up into a single German federation, but that would be at odds with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s proposals. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, spokesman for the East German government, said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s mention of `` confederative structures'' was heard `` with interest.'' But <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> `` avoided saying clearly that it could only concern a confederation between two sovereign nations.'' `` Reunification is not on the agenda and no one in the East or the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is earnest about changing European stability,'' he said. East German <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> said a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would raise thoughts of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of 1937, `` and I know no one in the world who would like such a <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also repeated his view that without a total overhaul of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s planned economy, massive West German assistance would be throwing money away. `` We do do not want to stabilize conditions which have become indefensible,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. And on that point as well, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s 10-point plan earned him little trust among East German leaders who fear disappearance of their Socialist system could increase their vulnerability to reunification. `` We are ready to cooperate with the Federal Republic -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-, but we are not to get into conditions or pre-requisites,'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s 10-point proposal for forming a federation with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as summarized from his German-language speech translated by The Associated Press: 1. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> offers immediate aid in humanitarian areas, including medical assistance. Additionally, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> offers to contribute to a special fund to finance foreign travel for East Germans, provided the East German government also contributes substantially. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also must drop its requirement that West German tourists exchange at least 25 marks -LRB- $ 13.50 -RRB- in hard currency per day while visiting <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. 2. Existing areas of cooperation of mutual benefit should be expanded, particularly in economics, technology, culture and environmental protection. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s telephone network should be upgraded. Talks on expanded rail ties and connection of the East German system to other European states should be opened. 3. Joint-venture projects should be legalized and encouraged. Electoral reforms should be implemented to allow free elections and secret ballots. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> must give up its guaranteed power monopoly. Bureaucratic planning and administrative practices must be phased out. Private businesses should be established and Western investments solicited. 4. Joint institutions and committees in economics, transport, ecology, science and technology, health and culture shouldbe established. 5. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is willing to develop, step by step, the structures of a federation with a legitimate, democratically elected East German government. Envisioned is establishment of joint government committees for continuous consultations and political decision-making, joint special committees and joint parliament commissions. 6. The future design of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> must fit in with the future design of a whole <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, with full respect for the integrity and security of each state, full respect for human rights, including the right of self-determination. 7. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> recommends a speedy decision on a trade and cooperation agreement with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that expands and ensures East German access to the European Common Market. 8. The confidence-building process in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is the heart of the design of a whole <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and must be energetically pursued. 9. Overcoming the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the division of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> requires wide-ranging energetic steps in disarmament and arms control, which must keep pace with political advances. This applies particularly to the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> negotiations on conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, agreement on confidence building measures, and a ban on chemical weapons. It also requires reducing the nuclear potential of the superpowers to strategic minimums. 10. The political approach aims to foster peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in which the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people can achieve unity through self-determination. German unity remains a goal of the federal Only in a climate of mutual trust can the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> be overcome.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nettlesome Graves disease, which causes teary eyes and double vision, is n't getting any better, but doctors say it is n't getting any worse. `` It's fairly stable,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokeswoman <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> told reporters after the first lady returned Tuesday evening from the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> `` The eyes have not gotten worse. She's not out of the woods yet. She's not cured. She's still got the disease,'' Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. The doctors examined Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for two hours, performing tests and putting two doses of drops in her eyes. They decided to vary the doses of prednisone she is taking for the condition, Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. Otherwise, there was to be no treatment change. `` Believe me when I tell you, nothing is worse, everything is better, I'm going home with very good news for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' the first lady told the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> Post-Bulletin. The long-range prognosis is unclear, Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said, adding that Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in `` fine spirits'' but acknowledged annoyance with the disease. `` These are some of the best times of her life and sometimes it is a pain to have to see everything twice,'' Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s condition, which initially caused a noticeable weight loss, was diagnosed earlier this year. She has regained some weight through water retention due to the prednisone. She underwent a radiation treatment in April to treat the excess hormone levels produced by her thyroid. That treatment was successful and the hormone levels are now fine, Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. Two <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> ophthalmologists _ Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> _ were on the team of physicians who earlier examined and treated Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the eye condition. Graves disease, thought to be related to the immune system, brings on an overactive thyroid, which in turn produces excessive amounts of certain hormones. Symptoms include fatigue, insomnia and swelling of eye tissues, causing irritation. The cause of the disease is unknown, but it can be controlled with drugs. After the tests Tuesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped by a <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> library and read a story to a group of children before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Labor's Hopes of Sending Delegation to Soviet Union This Week Dashed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> says its hopes of sending a delegation to meet with striking Soviet miners this week were dashed when Soviet officials refused to issue visas. Federation officials said Tuesday that the Soviets told them it was n't an appropriate time for an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation to visit the striking miners in the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION>. `` We are hopeful that it will be put together for another day, another time,'' said <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardesty </PERSON>. `` We are continuing to talk with the Soviets, but we have abandoned the timetable.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> requested visas for the five-member delegation after receiving a telegram from the striking Soviet miners two weeks ago. The miners praised the federation's efforts to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity and requested help in forming a free trade union `` They -LRB- Soviet officials -RRB- gave us the standard response, that this would not be a good time, that this would not be a beneficial time given the sensitive situation,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Chenoweth </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s international affairs department, one of those who requested a visa. `` Our intent was not to exacerbate the situation but to respond to the requests of the workers who invited us to investigate the conditions that brought them to strike,'' he said. `` It is our position that just because there are sensitive conditions does n't mean that a delegation should not be allowed. Calls to the Soviet Embassy for comment were not immediately returned. The telegram from the miners requested that the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> provide information on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labor laws and union organizing and said the workers were struggling not only for their rights but to end the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s leading role in Soviet governance. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>'s request for the visas also asked that the delegation be allowed to travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> and to meet privately with the miners. He asked for a response in time for the trip to begin by the end of this week. The delegation was to be led by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>. It was to include <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, president of the Bricklayers union; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Banovic </PERSON>, secretary treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a top aide to <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Chenoweth </PERSON>. Official Soviet media have described the miners and other strikers as threats to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last month proposed a law banning strikes in some vital industries, including coal mining.

 It's official: The <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> will build a National Museum of the American Indian as the newest attraction on the Mall. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed legislation Tuesday night clearing the way for officials to start designing the museum, which will draw most of its artwork and artifacts from a world-famed collection in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The measure also outlines the policy for returning American Indian and native Hawaiian human remains and funerary objects to the tribes and organizations for burial. It requires the Smithsonian to inventory all human remains in its collections. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed `` great pleasure'' in signing the legislation, the result of a political compromise after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawmakers fought to keep the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> museum in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The heart of the museum's collection will come from the Museum of the American Indian, run by the <ORGANIZATION> Heye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The compromise includes the opening of a $ 25 million satellite facility in the old <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Custom House in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, which will be called the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Heye </PERSON> <PERSON> Center </PERSON> of the National Museum of the American Indian. The <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> will build the $ 106 million museum on the Mall between the Air and Space Museum and the Botanical Gardens _ near the foot of <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> _ and build a $ 44 million storage and conservation center in <LOCATION> Suitland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, for the Indian artifacts. `` From this point, our nation will go forward with a new and richer understanding of the heritage, culture and values of the peoples of the Americas of Indian ancestry,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Heye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>'s collection is considered priceless, but the museum in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has not attracted the crowds _ or the financial backing _ that the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> museums in the nation's capital garner Indian tribal leaders and native Hawaiian groups for years have demanded the return of human remains kept in museum collections. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> `` will attempt to identify the origins of such remains and objects and will notify the appropriate tribes and organizations of its findings.'' The ultimate plan, he said, is for `` repatriation'' of the remains. `` This has been a difficult and complex issue to address, involving traditional values of American Indian people, the medial and scientific research value of the remains and objects and the trust responsibilities of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The law authorizes $ 10 million in planning and design expenditures for fiscal 1990, which began two months ago. The Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>'s 1990 appropriation includes $ 5.5 million in actual funds to start the work. The federal government will split the cost of revamping the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state.

<HEAD>Court: Pittston Violated Laws in Voting Against Union Proposals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge says the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> violated securities regulations by voting proxies against three proposals submitted by striking miners at its annual meeting. `` <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> did not have discretionary authority to vote management's proxies against the union's proposals,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Tuesday. The judge upheld the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> challenge on grounds the union proposals were n't mentioned on the cards shareholders signed to give management proxy power. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> rejected <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s arguments that it had `` discretionary authority'' to vote the proxies against the union proposals in May because it had indicated in other material sent to shareholders that it intended to oppose them. `` Nowhere in these letters did <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> actually disclose what the three proposals were,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The judge said <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s argument ignored regulations promoting `` an informed shareholder electorate'' and, if accepted, could lead to `` a world where shareholders could be misled and where corporate suffrage could be circumvented by way of overbroad claims of discretionary authority.'' <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> called the decision `` a resounding blow for shareholder rights at every American corporation.'' Attempts to reach <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> officials late Tuesday afternoon were unsuccessful. Calls to the company's <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> headquarters were unanswered. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary is locked in a bitter labor dispute with about 1,700 miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, used its proxies to defeat union proposals to submit a `` poison pill'' anti-takeover plan to shareholders, to allow shareholders to vote by secret ballot and to form a committee to study possible divestiture of some assets. Had <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> not usedthe 15.5 million management proxies it held, union officials say the first two proposals would have been approved. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said reaching a remedy would prove to be a `` difficult task'' because shareholders have changed since the vote six months ago, and ordered company and union attorneys to suggest possible remedies within two weeks. The miners struck <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in April, largely in a dispute over <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s intention to withdraw from an industrywide contract to provide medical and retirement benefits to <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> retirees. The union has been fined more than $ 30 million for violating picketing laws during the sometimes violent strike, and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s coal production is off significantly despite its use of replacement workers and some miners who refused to honor pickets Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> last month appointed former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary W.J. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to mediate. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> has met repeatedly with both sides and talks are scheduled to resume this week.

A copy of the speech was released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> also said the department would: _ Seek to sue <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> to force granting of permits for certain tests at the <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> site near <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> that the department is considering _ Delay sinking exploratory shafts at <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> _ Ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to let it build an interim storage facility before the permanent depot is in hand The department is required by law to take title in 1998 to the highly radioactive spent fuel stored at more than 100 operating civilian nuclear power plants. The 1982 legislation establishing the waste repository program envisioned that a waste depot able to hold spent fuel for 10,000 years would be in operation in 1998. The department has long wanted a plant, capable of temporary storage, to package the waste for permanent storage and ship it to the permanent repository. A temporary storage depot is called `` monitored retrievable storage,'' or MRS. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, fearing an MRS plant would end up being the permanent repository, has forbidden construction of such a plant until the permanent repository is too far along to be stopped. `` By decoupling the MRS option from the permanent repository, the department could be able to accept spent fuel from utilities in 1998, or soon thereafter,'' and would be able to show that it can package, ship and handle the spent fuel safely, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. He said the department will delay shaft-sinking until 1992 and `` perform only surface-based testing,'' starting in 1991, to make sure there is nothing that would rule out <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> before the expensive shafts are undertaken. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission told the department this summer that it should delay sinking the shafts until it understood better the earthquake and volcanic potential of the site. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the department had not received its first state air and land use permits two years after requesting them, and the state was refusing to consider the federal applications. The state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> has passed a bill forbidding the storage of nuclear waste in the state. `` This is not a reasonable response but one we can only conclude is driven by politics and a lack of desire to cooperate in the proper scientific evaluation of the site. Court is not our preferred course of action, but enough is enough,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said in announcing that the department had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to sue for the needed permits. If <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> does not respond to the required 30-day notice of a suit, `` Justice will file in January, and we will get on with the program,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 ordered the department to study three possible sites. Later, in what some <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> officials called an `` everybody gangs up on <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'' bill, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> instructed the department to study the <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> site on the government's nuclear weapons test range in detail first, and make that the waste repository if nothing turned up to rule it out.

<HEAD>Justice Moves to Quash Pan Am Subpoenas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is moving to quash subpoenas issued by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> airlines </ORGANIZATION> for documents in government files about the investigation of the explosion of Flight 103. The airline wants the information to defend itself against lawsuits filed by relatives of those killed in the Dec. 21 bombing over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, that left 270 people dead. In a brief statement Tuesday night, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it moved in a sealed court request last week to quash the subpoenas served on six government agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. While federal judges in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> declined to grant the government's request, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> was directed to narrow its request for information. The department said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> lawyers were told to submit a draft court order seeking information about how the suitcase with the bomb made its way aboard the flight. The department reserves the right to challenge the request for a court order, said agency spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the department moved to quash the subpoenas on the grounds that information in government files was part of an active criminal investigation and thus did not have to be produced. Meanwhile, a government source says that clothing fragments from the suitcase containing the bomb that destroyed the flight have been traced to a store in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. The fragments found at the crash site were linked to a suitcase that held the radio cassette player believed to have contained the explosive device, the source said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. A multinational team of investigators have traced the clothing fragments to a store in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, lending credence to information that the bomb passed through that <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island, the source said. British newspapers had previously reported the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> clothing link. The investigation is trying to identify the person who placed the suitcase on the flight from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where it was transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. The <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where it became Flight 103. It exploded en route to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. An insurance investigator hired by the airline said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government learned a bomb had been placed aboard the flight but did not tell <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman has denounced the investigator's report as outrageous Investigators are focusing on a possibility the terrorist group, <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, is responsible for the bombing.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index closed for the first time above 37,000 points Wednesday, while the dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen. The dollar finished trading at 143.53 yen, down 0.12 yen from Tuesday's close of 143.65 yen. The currency opened lower at 143.27 yen and rose toward the end of trading while ranging between 143.27 yen and 143.58 yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 36.16 points, or 0.10 percent, closing at 37,021.46, yet another high. The index had set its previous record only the day before when it gained 103.77 points. The index rose from 36,000 to 37,000 points in only five trading days. `` The Nikkei's performance is stronger than we expected,'' said <PERSON> Masahiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Umemori </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` There were no specific economic factors making the market so strong, except for its strength itself, which seemed to be reassuring and encouraging investors' buying incentives,'' he said. Participants also were eager to buy issues to increase year-end profits, <PERSON> Umemori </PERSON> said. December transactions started Tuesday. In currency dealings, the dollar was gradually rising from its lower start as investors bought it back to take profits on short, or oversold, positions following its overnight declines overseas, traders said. The dollar tumbled against most major currencies Tuesday when the West German mark surged on enthusiasm over the prospects for a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Yen-dollar trading was less active than that between the dollar and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies, especially the mark, said a dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity. The mark has been strong against the dollar and other currencies since <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> symbolically opened the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall Nov. 9. Market participants believe that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will be one of the principal beneficiaries of recent democratic and economic reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A new drug that quickly dissolves blood clots to prevent permanent damage after a heart attack has been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Anistreplase, the third clot-dissolving drug to be approved, can be administered in five minutes or less while the other two drugs must be administered continuously for one to three hours, said <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION>, which will market the drug as Eminase. Clot-dissolving drugs can open blocked arteries and limit damage from heart attacks, but are used in only about 20 percent of the estimated 400,000 to 600,000 patients who could benefit from treatment each year, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. More than 300,000 of the 1.5 million people who suffer heart attacks each year die before getting to the hospital and an additional 300,000 get there too late for treatment with clot-dissolving drugs, the department said in announcing the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> action. A blood clot blocking one of the arteries to the heart is the most common cause of heart attacks. The clot prevents blood from carrying oxygen to the heart muscle, which can lead to heart failure and death. The other two approved clot-dissolving drugs are alteplase, or TPA, and streptokinase.

 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> says random testing for possible use of illegal drugs by employees may begin early next year. Sessions told the bureau's 9,700 agents and nearly 13,000 support personnel of the random testing program in a notice dated Nov. 14, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kortan </PERSON> said Tuesday. The random testing is expected to begin after Jan. 14, <PERSON> Kortan </PERSON> said. A computer program will be used to randomly select the names of employees who will be required to undergo urine testing to determine if they have used illegal drugs, <PERSON> Kortan </PERSON> said. Employees who test positive could be suspended or dismissed, but `` each case would be evaluated individually,'' <PERSON> Kortan </PERSON> said. Refusal to provide a urine sample would also result in disciplinary action that could include dismissal, he said. The random testing is being started under a 1986 executive order by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. A number of federal agencies have instituted similar programs, which have met with mixed reviews in court decisions resulting from lawsuits filed by affected employees.

 <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> resigned as prime minister today, having failed to lead his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to decisive victory in elections for a new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> accepted the resignation but asked <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his Cabinet to remain in office until a new government is appointed, the presidential palace announced. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s resignation had been expected and is a formality that clears the way for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION> to try to form the next government _ provided <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> asks it to do so. The president normally would ask the party that won the most seats to attempt to form a government, but the constitution does not specifically require this. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who has served in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> since 1980 and became prime minister in 1984, spent a half-hour with <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> and drove away from the palace behind the wheel of a silver gray <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION>. He did not stop to speak to reporters. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders said Tuesday they were ready to enter into the secondary role of an opposition party for only the second time in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 42 years of independence. Lawmakers from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> scheduled a meeting later today to choose the man they claim will be the next prime minister of the world's most populous democracy. The leading candidate was former <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> ally <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, although he has said repeatedly he does not want to become prime minister. Other possible contenders included <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shekhar </PERSON>, one of the architects of the movement that ousted <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s mother and predecessor, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, from power in 1977. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s defeat in elections that year relegated the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to the role of opposition for 29 months until its election comeback in 1980. National Front leaders said they planned to call on <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> later in the day and tell him they were ready to form a government. Under the Indian Constitution, it is up to the president to decide who should be asked to form a government. In the past, the decision was clear-cut, because the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had always won a comfortable majority except for 1977, when the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> defeated Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. The situation this time was more confused. While the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its small party allies had the most seats, their combined total was far short of the 263 required for a majority. The National Front lagged even farther behind, but it enlisted the post-election tacit support of other opposition groups and buoyed its hopes of forming a government. With 486 of the 525 parliamentary seats decided, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had 186 and its allies 17 for a total of 203. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has 122, and its allies had 132 for a total of 254. The rest went to small parties and independents. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was swept into power in December 1984 on a wave of sympathy following the assassination of his mother two months earlier. But support for him declined in the face of allegations of government corruption. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. While <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was closeted with the president today, election officials announced that he had been elected to Parliament from his <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION> constituency for the third consecutive time. He defeated his nearest rival, <PERSON> Raj </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, grandson of Indian independence leader <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Mahatma </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> by 197,000 votes, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. The news agency did not give the vote totals, delayed by a partial re-vote Monday after authorities evidence of voter fraud in the initial Nov. 22 voting. <PERSON> Raj </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who is not related to <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, had charged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> activists with stuffing ballot boxes and resorting to violence. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who has served in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> since 1980 and became prime minister in 1984, spent a half-hour with <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> and drove away from the palace behind the wheel of a silver gray <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION>.

 A crane plummeted from the 16th story of a building under construction Tuesday, flattening a school van, cars and smashing into an office building across the street. At least five people were killed and 21 were injured, authorities said. `` It felt like an earthquake,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, who was in the damaged office building. `` I looked out and saw two bodies. One construction worker's boots were sticking up through a mass of jagged metal.'' In the aftermath of the accident that rained concrete and twisted steel on one of the busiest intersections in the financial district, a prosecutor said criminal negligence charges twice previously had been filed against the project's general contractor for accidents on <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> construction sites. There were conflicting statements on what was happening before the crane fell. Fire Chief <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said it was hoisting steel beams, but the general contractor said the crane was being repositioned from the 16th to the 20th floors. A piece of the crane at least three stories long dangled from the side of the building under construction two hours after the 8:30 a.m. accident. Police roped off the area and ambulances rushed in and out. The street was littered with flattened cars and a mangled motorcyle. Gas was cut off to the damaged 21-story office building for fear of an explosion. `` The wreckage looks absolutely incredible _ steel beams look like pickup sticks,'' said Acting Mayor <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Alioto </PERSON>, sitting in while Mayor Art Agnos tours the country urging tourists to return in the wake of the Oct. 17 earthquake. At an afternoon news conference at the scene, <PERSON> Alioto </PERSON> said experts could not immediately determine the cause of the collapse. She also said streets in a four-square-block area would be closed for at least a week for cleanup and repairs, and the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Street cable car also was shut down. <PERSON> Alioto </PERSON> said the dead were four construction workers, all from the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area, and the woman driving the school van, operated by <ORGANIZATION> Laidlaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's pretty rough,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Laidlaw </ORGANIZATION> Senior Vice President <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallack </PERSON>. `` They -LRB- other employees -RRB- are pretty upset, and we are arranging a chaplain and psychologist to go over to our offices.'' The fire chief said five people were listed as missing in the twisted steel and broken concrete. However, police Capt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said later that everyone had been accounted for. Three hospitals reported receiving 21 victims, four in serious condition. Most of the rest had minor injuries. <ORGANIZATION> Swinerton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Walberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the general contractor on the job, said the crane was being repositioned from the 16th story to the 20th story, the second such repositioning of the project. The crane, model No. SN355 manufactured by American Pecco of <PERSON> Millwood </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, had a capacity of 17 tons. The site was last inspected by the state <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 11. The project, which began in January, has not been cited for safety violations, the company said in a news release. Criminal negligence charges were twice filed against <ORGANIZATION> Swinerton </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Walbert </PERSON> in 1981 and 1986 for separate accidents on the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> sites, said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Deputy City Attorney <PERSON> MIchael </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON>. In 1981, charges were filed after a crane collapsed and an unknown number of people were killed, <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON> said. The case was dropped because prosecutors could not get the kind of charges they wanted to the jury, he said. Prosecutors wanted to prove only culpable negligence in the case, <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON> said, but the state labor code requires that prosecutors prove wanton and willful disregard for human safety, he said. In the 1986 case, <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Swinerton </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Walberg </PERSON> was a co-defendant in a case stemming from a construction site accident that killed three ironworkers after the steel superstructure of a 21-story office building was overloaded. That case resulted in a civil compromise in which <ORGANIZATION> Swinerton </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Walberg </PERSON> agreed to sponsor a safety seminar for downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> contractors and to donate an unknown amount to a labor safety board, <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON> said. According to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> records, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> project's crane sub-contractor, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Erection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, was fined for safety violations at least four times before 1987, three times in 1987 and once in 1988, said department spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Akins </PERSON>. The company is appealing the last reported fine, which was imposed after a worker fell to his death while working on the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in August 1988, <PERSON> Akins </PERSON> said. Attempts to reach <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Erection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, were not successful and telephone calls to company offices were not returned. In Tuesday's accident, debris rained down on a taxi driven by <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> <PERSON> Massarweh </PERSON>, who had two passengers at the time. The cab's back window was smashed. `` I do n't know where my passengers are,'' he said. `` I threw myself under the dashboard.'' He told his passengers to duck and when he next looked, they had left. He was unharmed. `` I heard a loud bang and stepped up and saw the tail end of a crane,'' said stockbroker <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Trabert </PERSON>, who saw the accident from his office in the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION>. `` It sounded like a Chinese New Year, only twice as loud. The crane was swinging and dangling in the air and people were scrambling away from the scene.'' A small fire broke out but was quickly extinguished. In 1988-89, the construction site yielded close to 1 million artifacts dating to a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> settlement in the 1800s.

The international human rights group said in a report that the Peruvian government's attempt to defeat the Shining Path rebel movement has raised the level of ruthless and indiscrimate violence. `` Torture, mutilation, ` disappearance,' murder and rape have become a hallmark of the armed forces' ` campaign against terrorism','' the international organization said in the report on human rights in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. It said the armed forces have singled out young people as suspected supporters of the Shining Path. `` The killing, torture and ` disappearance' of hundreds of children and young people has been one cost of a strategy of ` terror to fight terror' adopted by the armed forces in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>,'' it said. The government must uphold the law and not resort to the terror tactics of its enemies, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> said. It called on the government to investigate all alleged abuses and bring those responsible to justice. But Amnesty also stressed the extensive and continuing massacres, mutilations and torture by opposition forces such as the Shining Path. As a result, it said, peasants in areas where the government has declared a state of emergency have been `` caught between two fires,'' victims of massive abuse by both government forces and armed opposition. `` Many people have relatives who have been killed in cold blood by both anti-government guerrillas and government forces,'' the group said. More than 3,000 detainees have disappeared in the past seven years and at least 3,000 more are estimated to have been killed by security forces, individually or in mass executions, the report said. It said targets for human rights abuses by government forces are being drawn from increasingly broad sectors of society. Local government officers, community leaders, trade unionists, journalists, lawyers, academics and people considered critics or opponents of the government have been threatened, killed or had their homes and offices bombed, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. Many killings were carried out after the victims had been detained and tortured, it said. The report focuses on violations in the emergency zones, where more than half of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s 21 million people live under political-military command. In these zones, many killings appear to have been carried out to punish communities for rebel activities in their areas, it said. Amnesty said few males between 14 and 40 remain in these zones and women have been subjected to increasing abuse by government forces. Rape by troops is widespread, and women of all ages are at risk, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that it knows of no convictions for this crime in the emergency zones. The report said it is common for women to be raped after soldiers have entered villages and taken the men away. Other women have been raped while in detention, it said. It cited the case of <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Pisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Pisango </PERSON>, 26, a farmer from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alao </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lamas </LOCATION> province, who was raped, tortured and killed by soldiers after she reported her husband's disappearance in January 1988 Children appear to be most at risk during raids by government troops, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. `` Children and young people are under threat for their real or supposed sympathies in the emergency zones. The place they live in, the school they attend or the books they read may result in their secret detention, torture or murder,'' it said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has ended its rejection of outside investigations of its human rights practices and invited a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official to visit its prisons, according to Western diplomats. They said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reversed its policy as a political deal with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, which on Tuesday adopted by consensus a resolution that did not criticize <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s human rights situation. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has barred <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigators since the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Human Rights expressed concern in 1984 over reports of torture, summary executions and political and religious persecution in the country. The diplomats, speaking on condition they not be identified, said Ambassador <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharrazi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has invited the commission's representative, <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON> is expected to visit the country before February, when the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> commission is to meet in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to consider his final report. The diplomats said that in letters of understanding exchanged between <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kharrazi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> inspector will be able to bring his own translators and travel freely. <PERSON> Kharrazi </PERSON>'s letter invited <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> so he could prepare his report `` based on realities rather than allegations.'' In an interim report released two weeks ago, based on interviews with Iranian exiles and reports in the Iranian media, <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON> said torture, political executions and other human rights abuses were continuing in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It said punishments include flogging, whipping the soles of feet with cables or barbed wire, sexual abuse, mock executions, burning with cigarettes or hot metal rods and confinement of prisoners in `` small closed rooms with high temperatures and insufficient oxygen.'' <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON> also wrote, `` The Iranian press has reported few political executions so far in 1989. However, many allegations have been received that the large number of executions for drug trafficking masks political executions.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index, setting a record high for the sixth consecutive trading day, closed above 37,000 for the first time today, while the dollar eased down against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 36.16 points, or 0.10 percent, closing at 37,021.46. It took the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index just five trading days to rise from 36,000 to 37,000 points. The index closed above 36,000 for the first time on Nov. 21, when it ended at 36,059.87. Wednesday's session was marked by wide fluctuations as institutional investors traded large amounts of shares, said <PERSON> Kazuyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> dealer. The index fell by 49 points at mid-afternoon, he said, then recovered as investors picked up issues that had fallen earlier. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said the overall rising trend was slowing as market players became wary over the recent speed of the index's increase. Trading was hectic, with some 1.7 billion shares changing hands on the first section, up from 1.5 billion Tuesday. Among gainers were steel, shipbuilding and pharmaceutical issues. In currency dealing, the dollar closed at 143.53 yen, down 0.12 yen from Tuesday's close of 143.65 yen. It opened at 143.27 yen and ranged between 143.27 yen and 143.58 yen. Following a downswing on overseas markets overnight, the dollar gradually strengthened as it was bought back for profit-taking, said <PERSON> Toru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanai </PERSON>, a foreign exchange analyst with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, Co.. Japanese investors sold West German marks and Swiss Francs and bought back the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency to take profits on short, or oversold, positions following overnight declines overseas, he said The mark has been a focus of recent trading. Market players believe <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will be a major beneficiary of recent democratic and economic reforms in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. The West German mark has been strong against the dollar and other currencies since Nov, 9, when <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> began allowing its citizens to travel freely to the West. In contrast, the dollar-yen rate has been `` stuck between 142 yen and 144 yen'' without fresh market-affecting news, <PERSON> Kanai </PERSON> said. Fluctuations will remain small while the market awaits the release of a series of economic data later this week and the results of U.S.-Soviet summit talks starting Saturday, he said. Among economic figures to be announced later this week are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> individual income and consumption for October and the Japanese consumer price index for October.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> has dropped charges against a newly elected <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member who is accused of masterminding the 1984 assassination of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s mother, officials said today. <PERSON> Simranjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a member of the Sikh religious sect and a former police officer, was elected to the lower house of Parliament from the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> by an overwhelming majority this week. The order to drop charges against <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> was one of the last acts as prime minister by <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, the son and successor of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. A court must actually order <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s release, but that is considered a formality. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> failed to lead his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to a decisive election victory this week. He tendered his resignation today, but is to remain in office until a new government is appointed. He asked Home Minister <PERSON> Buta </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> to `` take steps to withdraw the case'' against <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a ministry spokesman said. The spokesman, who can not be identified under briefing rules, said: `` The Home Ministry is examining the prime minister's directions, but the release can only be ordered by the relevant court. The shots that killed Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> on Oct. 31, 1984, were fired by two of her Sikh bodyguards. One of them was shot to death on the spot by other bodyguards. The surviving gunman and a Sikh government clerk convicted in the plot were hanged in The government said the assassination was masterminded by Sikh extremists fighting for a separate homeland in the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, who has been jailed for the past five years on sedition charges, was charged with conspiracy when the assassination case was re-opened in April. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, in a dispatch today, quoted <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> as saying: `` I will hold no ill-will or rancor. I have always striven to heal wounds. At times I have succeeded. Sometimes I have been disappointed. `` If there is any more step that can be taken to bring down the curtain on the unfortunate past, and to ring in the future, that step should be taken now. The conspiracy case ... will not heal wounds,'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> decided to seek <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s release because <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> had sworn allegiance to the constitution. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 44, was elected from the <LOCATION> Tarn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Taran </LOCATION> constituency in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, campaigning from a jail more than 850 miles away in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a senior officer in the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, resigned soon after Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> ordered an army attack on the Golden Temple in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sikhdom </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine, to flush out Sikh militants entrenched there. More than 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs, were killed in the 1984 army operation that precipitated the revenge slaying of Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Another Sikh charged with conspiracy in the <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> murder, Attinder Pal <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, also was elected to Parliament while in jail. There has been no word on whether he, too, may be freed. <PERSON> Bimal </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalsa </PERSON>, widow of <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, the assassin who was killed on the spot, and his father, <PERSON> Sucha </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, also were elected. All three belonged to <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Akali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION> party. More than 7,500 people have died in the 8-year campaign for the homeland that Sikh extremists propose to carve out of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, a farming state bordering <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Sikhs, whose religion is rooted in both Islam and <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>, comprise just 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people, but they have a slight majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Homosexual activists are applauding a state judicial panel's decision to censure a judge who said he gave a lighter sentence to a killer because the two victims were `` queers.'' Attorneys for District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> said they were disappointed that `` the commission must have succumbed to pressure from the media and from uninformed special interest groups.'' Members of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alliance </LOCATION> say they still want <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> to step down. `` I believe that it's certainly a step in the right direction,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waybourn </PERSON>, president of the group. `` But Judge <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> remains on the bench. What is to happen now to gay men and lesbians who come into his courtroom?'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, an attorney for the alliance, said the group intends to file a petition with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> calling for <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s removal. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> issued its censure Tuesday for <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, whose remarks to reporters in December ignited a yearlong storm of criticism. Last December, <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> said he sentenced <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bednarski </PERSON> to 30 years in prison _ instead of life _ for the slaying of two men in a park because the victims were homosexual. `` Those two gays that got killed would n't have been killed if they had n't been cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> told reporters at the time. `` I do n't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys. I've got a teen-age boy.'' The commission said <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s comments `` were destructive of public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.'' Public censure is the strongest action the commission could take short of recommending the 57-year-old Republican's removal from the bench. The commission ruled that <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s statements violated the Code of Judicial Conduct, which prohibits judges from making public comments on a pending case and requires them to promote public confidence in the judiciary. `` The hostility and distrust generated by this judge's irresponsible statements created an additional burden for the entire judiciary,'' it said <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> has n't spoken to reporters since December. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s office said Tuesday he would not comment But a statement issued from <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>, was sharply critical of the commission's move: `` The commission has ignored most of the findings and conclusions of the special master, who was appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and is the only neutral arbiter in this entire proceeding.''

<HEAD>Jury Reaches One Verdict in 2{-Year-Old Molestation Trial; 64 to

<TEXT>
 The jury in the 2 -LCB- - year-old <ORGANIZATION> McMartin </ORGANIZATION> preschool molestation trial returned its first sealed verdict after more than three weeks of deliberations, but still has 64 counts to decide The jury also indicated Tuesday it was deadlocked on another count. Concerned that the longest criminal trial in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history could end in a mistrial, the judge has taken the unusual step of having jurors return verdicts under seal one at a time, instead of waiting until decisions are made on all counts. There are no more alternate jurors, so if one panel member drops out, a mistrial would have to be declared on any unresolved charges against <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 31, and his mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 63. `` Taking them one at a time is an insane process. But waiting for all of them is just as insane because we may lose a key juror before that time and thus lose all of those verdicts,'' Superior Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> said he could find no precedent to support his plan, but added that circumstances required it. He planned a meeting with attorneys Friday to decide when the verdicts should be read, but said that if two or more decisions are returned by then, an announcement could come as early as next week. The Buckeys are charged with conspiracy and child molestation at their family-owned <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> preschool. The trial has cost <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> more than $ 15 million. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, objected to the procedure <ORGANIZATION> Pounders </ORGANIZATION> set down, saying jurors should have the chance to change their minds about any count as their talks proceed. But the judge said, `` I'm not going to tell them they should take sealed verdicts and redecide them.'' Before returning the sealed verdict, the jurors indicated they were deadlocked on one count. `` They've said only that they've taken several ballots and can not reach a verdict on a count,'' <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> said. `` Given the fact there are 65 counts, that is not too significant.'' The judge said the jury's questions led him to believe the deadlock involves a boy whose mother set off the McMartin investigation six years ago with a complaint that her son had been molested. The mother since has died and the boy did not testify. Jurors had only medical evidence on which to consider the charges involving him. The defense called that evidence inconclusive.

<HEAD>California Measure Would Double Business Taxes for Social Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The latest <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ballot measure seeks to shelter the homeless, provide affordable housing, improve education, repair roads and reduce residential property taxes. There's a catch, of course: The <ORGANIZATION> Split-Roll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> raise the business property tax from 1 percent to 2.2 percent. The measure has survived an important court challenge, and its author predicted Tuesday it will appear on the ballot either in June or November 1990, depending on how fast signatures on the petition are verified. Proponents say the measure is needed in large part because <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Proposition 13, the property-tax slashing measure that launched a national tax revolt in 1978, has left state and local governments without the money for basic services. It is sponsored by Voter Revolt, the group whose Proposition 103 was approved by voters last year and is among the nation's most radical of attempts to control insurance rates. Homeowners have a major incentive to vote for the new measure: a $ 500 yearly reduction in their residential property tax. Opponents, however, say most businesses will just pass on their extra costs to consumers. They say such sweeping changes should be enacted by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> as a part of a general tax increase. `` It's a thinly disguised tax increase for every person who lives in the state,'' said <PERSON> Martyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>, the state director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Businesses </ORGANIZATION>, one of many business groups who oppose the measure. But the measure's author, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>, said it was needed precisely because lawmakers have been ineffective. `` The only reason we have to bring such a complex initiative to the ballot is that we have a paralyzed state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> that ca n't address the major problems of the state,'' he said Opponents, including the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, asked the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> to invalidate it, arguing it violates <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s constitutional ban on initiatives dealing with more than one subject `` On the one hand, it changes property tax methods, and on the other it creates new social programs relating to the homeless and housing,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON>, a lawyer for the opponents. But the court, in a decision received this week, refused to review the case. <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON> said opponents will appeal to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said the high court has never intervened in such a case. And <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, another official of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Businesses </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged the measure would probably make the June ballot. Under the initiative, business property would be taxed at 2.2 percent instead of the 1 percent now standard in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Residential property would still be taxed at 1 percent, with the first $ 57,000 in value exempt, compared versus $ 7,000 today. Homes assessed at $ 1 million or more would n't get the increased exemption. Voter Revolt says 842,119 Californians signed the petition by October; 595,485 valid signatures are needed to qualify it for the ballot. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said it will appear on either the June or November ballot, depending on how fast the signatures are verified. The state legislative analyst estimates the measure would generate $ 7.9 billion a year when fully operative in 1991. Of that, $ 5 billion would go to homeowners and to increased rental-tax credits, the rest to state and local governments for affordable housing, shelter for the homeless, better education and repair of crumbling roads, sewers, bridges and the like. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said that in the long run, such improvements would be good for business. Many businesses already are finding it impossible to locate in a state plagued with astronomical housing costs, clogged roads, mediocre schools, and infrastructure problems. `` Business will be more profitable if we solve problems of law enforcement, zoning, streets, education and housing,'' he said. `` All of that has an impact on the long-term business prospects.''

<TEXT>
 Space shuttle Discovery sustained little damage to its heat shield tiles and had few other problems during its five-day military mission, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> official said. `` The basic orbiter system itself looks like it's just maturing as everybody promised it would and I think the hardware is starting to prove itself,'' said Tip Talone, Discovery's overseer between flights. Discovery was on schedule to begin a two-day flight back to Kennedy Space Center atop a jumbo jet Saturday, <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said he tried to avoid the cliche of reporting that Discovery had come back as `` the best and cleanest one yet,'' but `` it really is.'' Initial inspection indicated fewer than 10 thermal tiles would need replacement because of damage. The tiles are typically damaged by debris hits during launch and landing. Discovery landed Monday on a concrete runway rather than a clay runway on <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' dry lakebed, which reduces the amount of debris kicked up by the tires. <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> also said the brakes were in good condition and the right side tires had more wear than the others but that was not considered worrisome. The amount of damage to an orbiter determines how long it will take to make it ready for its next flight and affects the schedule for facilities shared by all the orbiters at <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, the space shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> was transported to a refurbished launch pad Tuesday for a Christmastime mission to deploy one satellite and retrieve another the size of a bus before it falls to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Discovery's next mission is to carry the Hubble space telescope into orbit in late March. `` The bottom line is we think that we've got a really good start ... to get the Hubble out,'' <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said. Discovery's toilet broke and had to be fixed by the crew, but few other problems showed up during the mission. `` The inflight anomaly list was extremely clean,'' <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said. Its five astronauts reportedly achieved their main goal on Thursday by releasing a $ 300 million spy satellite, but there was no confirmation of the mission's purpose because of Defense Department-mandated secrecy.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Gold Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell in early European trading today and currency dealers said there were no elements in sight to break the downward slide. Gold prices rose. `` Even though the dollar is entering an oversold range, people are still selling,'' said one trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` We have had a downward movement since last night, and the trend is still lower,'' said a dealer at a bank in <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The West German mark continued to be bolstered by an increasingly positive view of the accelerating pace of change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which is likely to present huge business opportunities for West German companies, he said. Rumors that the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> might raise its key interest rates again Thursday to starve off inflationary pressures associated with the influx of East German refugees also helped, he said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.12 yen to a closing 143.53 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 143.44 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday: _ 1.7780 West German marks, down from 1.7880 _ 1.5885 Swiss francs, down from 1.5950 _ 6.0725 French francs, down from 6.1035 _ 2.0075 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0270 _ 1,314.00 Italian lire, down from 1,319.50 _ 1.1663 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1674 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar It cost $ 1.5635 to buy one pound, slightly more expensive than $ 1.5625 late Tuesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 412.10 a troy ounce, up from $ 411.25 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 410.75. `` Gold has risen so far so fast that one has got to look for a pullback,'' said one <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> bullion dealer, predicting gold would drift back down to 405 dollars before attempting another climb. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 410.70, up from $ 410.50 bid late Tuesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 2.16 to close at a bid $ 411.35.

 A baker has been sentenced to six months in prison for the fatal shooting of his best friend, who identified his killer by blinking his eyes. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Zollbrecht </PERSON> wept as he apologized for the death of his friend, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sannicandro </PERSON>. `` I would never hurt <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Zollbrecht </PERSON>, 45. `` I'm sorry for what happened. ... I'm sorry I touched the gun. I'm sorry.'' <PERSON> Sannicandro </PERSON>, 38, died more than six hours after <PERSON> Zollbrecht </PERSON> shot him in the abdomen on June 3, 1988, while both men were working in a <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> bakery. As he was being wheeled into surgery, detectives and an attending physician questioned <PERSON> Sannicandro </PERSON> and urged him to respond to the questions with eye blinks. One blink meant `` yes''; two blinks `` no.'' According to trial testimony, <PERSON> Sannicandro </PERSON> blinked `` yes'' when asked if <PERSON> Zollbrecht </PERSON> had shot him and blinked `` no'' when asked if the shooting was accidental. He was unable to speak because he had a breathing tube in his throat. `` God brought him back for a few moments to communicate with detectives,'' <ORGANIZATION> Westchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaCava </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zollbrecht </PERSON> also admitted when he placed the emergency call to police that he had shot his friend, Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said. <PERSON> LaCava </PERSON> also sentenced Zollbrecht to five years' probation and 1,000 hours of community service and ordered him to get treatment for alcoholism and psychological problems. According to testimony during the trial, <PERSON> Zollbrecht </PERSON> had a history of alcohol abuse, and his boss had hidden the gun on the night of the shooting. But <PERSON> Zollbrecht </PERSON> went and got the gun, and the shooting occurred when both were drunk. The defense maintained that <PERSON> Sannicandro </PERSON>'s deathbed testimony never should have been allowed into evidence, since <PERSON> Sannicandro </PERSON> also was drunk at the time of the shooting.

<TEXT>
 A rare, late-season tropical depression headed for the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> today, and forecasters said it could become this year's 11th named storm. At 5 a.m. EST, the depression's poorly-defined center was near 20.4 north latitude, 85.7 west longitude, about 105 miles south-southwest of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. It was moving north at about 10 mph with highest sustained winds estimated at 35 mph. It was expected to maintain that motion through today, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> forecaster <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON>. He added that he did n't think the system would become a hurricane because it is likely to run into a cold front moving down the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> peninsula. It appeared this morning that the clash between the two would most affect the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION> off the peninsula's tip. `` There'll be rain and some wind,'' he said. `` It'll be primarily a concern for our marine interests.''

<TEXT>
 Former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, facing trial in the Iran-Contra case, has begun a fund-raising drive to pay for his legal fees, according to a published report today. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> wrote a four-page letter saying liberal special interests want him `` silenced ... bankrupt or imprisoned,'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. He said that after having put five sons through college on a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> salary, he can not meet his expenses alone. `` There is only one reason why I am being put through this ordeal: political revenge,'' wrote <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, who describes himself as `` one man, alone against the massive onslaught of liberal special interests who want to imprison me for serving my country.'' He went on: `` The liberals in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wanted to destroy the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency any way they could. When they found that they were going to be unsuccessful, they turned on me.'' <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> faces five criminal charges in a trial scheduled to begin Jan. 22. The charges include conspiring to obstruct congressional inquiries in August 1986 about whether <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> was making false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and secretly helping to arm the Contras. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckler </PERSON>, called the former admiral's legal fees `` substantial'' but would not disclose how much they were. Some of those involved in the fund-raising appeal suggested the fees would be $ 3 million to $ 4 million, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> was unavailable for comment, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> wrote he has `` always done what I thought was in the best long-term interests of the country,'' but `` because I care more about the long-term security of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> than I do about myself, I must now face the liberals' accusations surrounding the ` Iran-Contra affair.''' Retired Adm. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, one of three retired admirals who set up a defense fund for <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, said they were concerned his legal fees would be about the same as <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s but he would not attract as many contributors as the former Marine. The other two former admirals are <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>.

 Despite the reforms sweeping the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers agreed today to refrain from unilateral reductions in conventional arms until a formal agreement with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact can be reached. The ministers, ending two days of talks, said in a statement that they welcomed the changes in the East but issued a word of caution. `` There has unquestionably been a change in the nature of the threat which confronts us, but not yet a significant change in the military capability of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact,'' <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not bring home any troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> without first consulting <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. `` We will not act unilaterally,'' he said, referring to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> study of troop cuts in the early 1990s that would exceed those now being negotiated at <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> conventional arms talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. In their statement, the ministers noted the start of unilateral reductions in conventional, or non-nuclear, arms by the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. But they insisted, `` we can not ignore the fact that, even after completion of these reductions, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact will retain well-equipped forces which substantially outnumber those of the West.'' As a result, the statement said the ministers would take a `` pragmatic, step-by-step approach'' to changes in the East, where <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have embraced democratic reform to varying degrees. The ministers also renewed their `` determination not to make any unilateral reductions that could risk undermining the prospect of reaching a -LRB- conventional arms -RRB- accord.'' The 16 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and seven <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> members are currently negotiating cuts in non-nuclear arms and troops in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. In those talks, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wants the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut their forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to 275,000 soldiers each. That would mean a cutback of 300,000 Soviet and 30,000 American troops.

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ethiopian government and Eritrean rebel negotiators shook hands today on an agreement to hold formal peace talks, then came out fighting in a display that bodes ill for future negotiations. At a news conference ending nearly three weeks of preliminary talks, the two sides disagreed on the exact meaning of their agreement and accused each other of foot-dragging and misrepresentations. A weary former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who mediated the negotiations, sat between the Ethiopian and Eritrean representatives as they exchanged accusations and commented: `` I've heard this kind of talk for 20 days. But <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, while cautioning that he was `` not naive enough to predict certain success,'' said he was `` more optimistic than I have been at any time'' that the sides could find an end the 28-year-old war between the government and Eritreans fighting to create a separate homeland in the north. The preliminary negotiations, which began in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in September and resumed in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> on Nov. 20, ended with no agreement on a date or place for the main peace talks. They also ended with the Eritreans accusing <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s Marxist government of obstructing the talks and contesting <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s statement that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had declined to act as an observer in further talks `` During the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> talks in general, and last week in particular, the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> regime, some of its allies and certain individuals have resorted to lies, blackmail and sinister manipulations to obstruct the participation of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> as an observer,'' said <PERSON> Alamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Saiyed </PERSON>, the chief Eritrean negotiator. <PERSON> Alamin </PERSON> insisted that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had not rejected an invitation to act as an observer in the main talks, although <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> had turned down the offer in a telephone conversation Friday. <PERSON> Alamin </PERSON> also took issue with an informal comment by <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> following his reading of the closing communique. The former president said observers chosen for the main talks `` shall witness all negotiating sessions without directly participating in the discussions.'' The Eritrean negotiator said `` mediation can not be limited to the co-chairmen'' and noted that the role of observers was not spelled out in the joint communique. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> conceded that `` there is some disagreement about the role to be played by observers.'' <PERSON> Alamin </PERSON> also said the government delegation had refused to discuss a drought in northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> that he said threatens 1.5 million people with starvation in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> alone. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that up to 4 million people risk starvation in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and three other northern Ethiopian provinces, Tigre, <LOCATION> Wollo </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gonder </PERSON>. The government has disputed that forecast. The Eritrean rebels took up arms against the government in 1961 in an attempt to gain independence for <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s northernmost province, a former Italian colony that was federated with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mandate in 1952. The war and associated famines are estimated to have claimed more than 1 million lives.

The `` intelligence community believes we would have some 33 to 44 days of warning time,'' and possibly six months, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in today's editions, quoting a study prepared for <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> war plans had been based on the assumption that the West would have only 10 to 14 days' warning, the newspaper said. A short expected warning time led to decisions to invest large sums in airlift capability and forward storage of ammunition and supplies. The study said that while it remained possible for the Soviets to launch a quick attack that would allow the West less than two weeks' warning, such a move would be `` quite risky'' for the Soviets. The study also found that during the 1968 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was so worried about possible intervention from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> that it put its battlefield nuclear rockets on 10-minute alert, even though `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> clearly wanted to avoid a general war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.''

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Senior Cabinet ministers today studied an official report about alleged police death squads, and the state radio urged a public inquiry to erase any doubts about a possible cover-up. Neither Justice Minister <PERSON> Kobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> nor Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> commented publicly on the contents of the report. It was completed Tuesday by a provincial attorney general and a police commander after a five-week investigation of claims by three former policemen that they served in death squads which assassinated government opponents. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> and <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> were expected to forward the report to President <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> promptly so he could determine what further steps should be taken. New allegations about death squad activity were made in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> on Tuesday by a 27-year-old South African who identified himself as <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> and said he was a cousin of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>. The general said today that he had no knowledge of a relative named <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it was not ready to comment on the man's allegations that his former army unit had carried out attacks on civilians. The South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which closely reflects government thinking, said today that `` the very idea of a police assassination squad operating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is so monstrous as to be almost unbelievable.'' `` It is absolutely essential that the facts are established ... in a manner that leaves no room for doubt that justice had been done,'' the commentary said. `` Unless justice is not only done, but seen to be done, those allegations will be believed, and exploited for propaganda, in quarters hostile to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, in a speech to a police parade Tuesday, said strong action would be taken against any officers implicated in death squad activity. He said most police officers behaved `` in an impeccable manner'' and did not deserve to be `` dragged through the mud.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> also announced major steps to reduce the influence of military and police officials over national security policy. He abolished the controversial <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, established under former President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to coordinate a counterrevolutionary strategy that included suppression of activists and upgrading of black communities. Several newspapers suggested today that abolition of the security system was a prelude to partial or total lifting of the state of emergency, declared by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> in June 1986. The system was dominated by security force officers and reported directly to the powerful <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, consisting of generals, police commanders and selected Cabinet ministers. Critics said the system usurped the powers of Parliament and municipal governments while setting policies on the international, national and local level.

<HEAD>Police Order Reinforcements Into Embattled Black Township</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police officials today ordered reinforcements into a <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> township where political violence has claimed at least a dozen lives this week, including three men killed by police. Scores of homes have been burned and numerous street battles have occurred in <LOCATION> Mpumalanga </LOCATION>, near the provincial capital, <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>. The violence has included clashes between rival black factions and a wave of attacks on police. <LOCATION> Mpumalanga </LOCATION> has been the center of an upsurge of political violence throughout <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION>. More than 30 people have been killed in unrest in the province this week, according to police _ one of the bloodiest periods during a three-year power struggle in which more than 3,000 blacks have died. The conflict is between members of <LOCATION> Inkatha </LOCATION>, a relatively conservative Zulu political organization headed by <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, and supporters of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a militant anti-apartheid coalition. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Niekerk </PERSON>, police commissioner for <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION>, said today that additional security forces would sent into <LOCATION> Mpumalanga </LOCATION>. He gave no details, but there were unconfirmed reports the reinforcements would include army units. Police headquarters said six people were killed in <LOCATION> Mpumalanga </LOCATION> in the 24-hour period ending at daybreak today. These included three men shot and killed by police who were fired on after arriving to break up a clash in which two other men had been killed. Five other unrest deaths were reported in the same period elsewhere in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION>. Police officials have insisted their forces seek to remain neutral in the factional conflict. However, a delegation of lawyers and human rights activists which visited <LOCATION> Mpumalanga </LOCATION> on Tuesday contended that police were assisting Inkatha vigilantes. Both Inkatha and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> oppose apartheid, but they differ sharply over strategy. <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> condemns the front's use of boycotts and encouragement of economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He also opposes the guerrilla tactics of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which is aligned with the front. Some <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leaders depict <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> as a government collaborator because of his position as chief minister of the tribal homeland of <ORGANIZATION> KwaZulu </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-controlled newspapers today joined <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders and some dissidents in rejecting West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s call for eventual German reunification. `` What Does <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> Want: Anschluss or Real Partnership?'' asked the <ORGANIZATION> Junge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in a headline. Anschluss is the German word for annexation and is used to describe the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> takeover of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in 1938. After <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> made his proposal on Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> said reunification could conjure fears of a Nazi-era <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, `` and I know no one in the world who would like such a <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> welcomed <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s call for closer cooperation between the Germanys. Many Europeans worry that with its economic and political might, a reunited <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of 80 million people would dominate the continent. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was divided into two states after the Nazi defeat in World War II. The prospect of reunification seemed distant less than a month ago, but sweeping changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have revived the idea. With East Germans disillusioned with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule fleeing in droves and taking to the streets bythe hundreds of thousands, the party leadership ousted hard-liner <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> last month and launched a radical program of reforms with the promise of free elections. The opening of the country's borders on Nov. 9 gave East Germans unrestricted freedom to travel to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for the first time since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. Some people in both countries have called for reunification, an idea consistently rejected by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s leaders. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> emphasized the need for two `` sovereign, independent German states.'' `` A unity of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is n't on the agenda,'' he told <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network. However, he did not rule out a confederation, or partnership, between the two Germanys, that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> promoted. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said talk of such an arrangement `` requires more time.'' <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, the East German government spokesman, said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s proposal for eventual reunification went `` beyond realities and could easily lead to irritation ... by not observing the sovereignty and independence of the two German states.'' In a statement carried by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s proposals for cooperation contained `` interesting starting points for negotiations.'' A group of leading East German intellectuals also rejected reunification and expressed fear of their country `` being pocketed'' by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. They said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should remain a separate socialist state. The dissidents, including prominent authors <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heym </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, started a petition drive Tuesday calling for a national `` vote of confidence'' in socialism. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said today that <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> had signed a petition and told the dissidents in a letter: `` We have the historic duty to preserve this country with its anti-fascist ideals and traditions as a socialist alternative within German development.'' In his speech to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> sought to allay fears about a reunited <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, saying: `` The Germans ... will be a dividend for a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that is coming together, and never again a threat.'' He did not offer a timetable and made it clear it could take years to form a federation. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said German reunification can only occur as the overall East-West division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is overcome. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> proposed creation of joint governmental and parliamentary committees whose purpose would be `` permanent consultation'' between the two Germanys on economic, environmental, cultural, and scientific matters. In other developments Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> outlined a new travel proposal that is aimed at controlling some of the economic damage <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> faces by having an open border with its richer neighbor. Since East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened the borders, illegal currency trading has intensified and black-market dealings have been rampant. Under the proposal, East Germans can have their passports revoked if they are found to be working abroad or earning any income without the consent of the East German government. `` Every citizen of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has the right to travel abroad any time and to obtain a passport for this purpose,'' states the proposed law that will be discussed at a parliamentary session beginning Friday. The government last week imposed new customs controls aimed at intercepting huge stashes of currency or subsidized consumer goods headed West in the bags of East German travelers. In the first publication of official figures, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> said today that 3.4 million people had left <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during 40 years of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule. West German estimates say the number is far higher. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s current population is about 16.5 million

 The newspaper of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> has told politicians that if they want to advertise holiday greetings, they'll have to sign a declaration supporting a constitutional amendment against abortion. So far, politicians are refusing to sign. A spokesman for one, <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, a Democrat considering a run for governor, said he was offended despite his anti-abortion stance. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> politicians traditionally buy Christmas greetings ads in the Providence Visitor. The paper previously has barred campaign ads from pro-choice politicians, but in a recent letter told officeholders and office seekers that congratulatory ads and holiday greetings also would be rejected unless the politicians signed the declaration. `` The Providence Visitor holds the view that abortion constitutes the greatest single outrage being waged against humanity in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today,'' the letter said. The policy was decided on at a meeting last month of the Visitor's board of directors, said the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, the newspaper's executive director. The publisher, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelineau </PERSON>, did not attend but supports the decision, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gelineau </PERSON> recently chastised Rep. <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, for her view that a woman's decision whether to have an abortion is her own, although <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> personally opposes abortion. Circulation figures were not immediately available for the weekly paper, but it is an influental publication in a state where the population is two-thirds <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said the paper could lose as much as $ 5,000 in revenue a year. He would not identify the politicians to whom the letters were sent but said no forms had been returned. Dec. 15 is the deadline for the Christmas ads. Among those who have refused to sign are <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Traficante </PERSON>, both of whom oppose abortion. `` I do n't think it's fair,'' said <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>. `` I'm an administrator.

 A 21-month-old girl who received the nation's first living-donor liver transplant was recovering today after a complication, and her father hoped to have her home for Christmas <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> underwent a second operation Tuesday to stop internal bleeding detected 12 hours after she received a piece of her mother's liver. She was in critical but stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> this morning. `` She was very stable through the night,'' hospital spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> said. `` She rested comfortably.'' `` She's looking much better,'' her father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said Tuesday. `` Even with the surgery and everything, she looked great,'' he said, his voice trembling. `` Her eyes were kind of open and she saw me and ... her face kind of lit up a bit.'' Doctors removed the left lobe of 29-year-old <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s liver for the transplant Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was in fair condition today. She was moved out of intensive care and was expected to be released in about a week, doctors said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the sudden return to the operating room caused some tense moments for him and his wife. `` It really scared me when they came up and told me the doctor of the hospital wanted to talk to me,'' he said. In the Smiths' hometown of <LOCATION> Schertz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, the girl's grandfather, <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION>, also felt apprehension as he awaited updates from his wife, <PERSON> Ada </PERSON>, who had traveled to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` As you're waiting, thoughts can go through your mind,'' he said. `` Some thoughts are good, some are bad.'' The surface of <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>'s new liver _ about the size of a man's fist _ had begun to bleed, a complication that occurs in about 30 percent of all liver transplants, and she was returned to the operating room about 4:40 a.m. Tuesday, said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON>, the hospital's director of pediatric transplant services Doctors corrected the problem in a few minutes but kept her in surgery for nearly five hours for observation, said Dr. <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON>, who headed the surgical team. <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> may undergo another exploratory operation within a few days to examine the liver, doctors said. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was looking further ahead. `` The only plans we really have -LRB- are -RRB- ... to have a Christmas at home with our kids, get back to our jobs and get on with our lives,'' the father said. `` With this liver, she can live the rest of her life. `` Her whole future is ahead of her now.'' After the second operation, <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> was awake, active and moving around, although she remained on sedation and a ventilator, <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON> said. `` The transplant is definitely functioning and for now things are back on a smooth course,'' he said. <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> suffered from an often-fatal liver disorder called biliary atresia, the leading cause for liver transplants involving children. She had been waiting more than a year for a cadaver transplant when her parents asked to participate in the hospital's living-donor program The procedure was complicated when Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s spleen was damaged and had to be removed, but doctors predicted she would recover fully. Liver transplants from living donors have been performed only three times _ in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. All have been done in emergency situations, and at least one child has died.

<TEXT>
 The legislature today passed a motion urging the forced return of Vietnamese refugees, and several lawmakers condemned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to the idea. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> vote reflected the strong local sentiment to rid this British colony of the nearly 57,000 Vietnamese languishing in squalid detention centers after fleeing their Communist homeland by boat. `` Mandatory repatriation is a must, and it should have been implemented yesterday,'' lawmaker <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Fan </PERSON> said during the debate. The measure was merely a resolution urging that <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> secure an agreement for repatriation with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is responsible for the negotiations. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s official news agency said today that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> continues to reject forced repatriation but will work toward reaching a settlement `` on the basis of respect for the humanitarian spirit.'' The nearly 12,000 Vietnamese in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> camps who arrived before June 1988 automatically received refugee status and will be resettled overseas. But under a tough new policy, the more than 44,000 boat people who sailed into the colony later are considered illegal immigrants subject to repatriation against their will unless they can prove they fled political or religious persecution. Of the nearly 7,000 screened, only 687 have been granted refugee status. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been among the most vocal opponents of forced repatriation, saying conditions must first improve in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Some lawmakers attributed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s position to a `` guilty conscience,'' a reference to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in the Vietnam War. They also argued that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions were preventing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> from escaping poverty, thereby contributing to the stream of Vietnamese fleeing to seek a better life abroad. `` There is no reason for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to oppose mandatory repatriation of -LRB- Vietnamese -RRB- illegal immigrants when they are practicing this every day at the U.S.-Mexican border,'' lawmaker <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> argued. Boat people already have staged hunger strikes and demonstrations in their detention centers to protest forced repatriation. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> motion was overwhelmingly approved by voice vote.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A world auction record in sterling was set for the work of Italian artist <PERSON> Amedeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Modigliani </PERSON> when a Japanese gallery bought a painting by him for the equivalent of $ 7.89 million, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s said. The sale of `` Fillette au Tablier Noir'' was part of an auction Tuesday night of impressionist and modern paintings and sculpture that together brought in $ 104 million. Twenty-two works, including ones by <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Monet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>, each fetched more than $ 1.56 million. The Fujii Gallery paid 5,060,000 pounds for `` Fillette au Tablier Noir,'' a painting of a girl in a black dress. The previous highest auction price for <PERSON> Modigliani </PERSON> was 4.4 million pounds in March 1988, then the equivalent of $ 7.9 million against a stronger dollar. The seller was not identified but the picture last belonged to a private collection in <LOCATION> Baden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. It was painted in 1918 in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Modigliani </PERSON>, whose portraits were characterized by deep oval faces, only became famous after his death at age 36 in 1920 from tuberculosis, aggravated by poverty, drink and drugs. The top price, paid anonymously by a telephone bidder, was $ 8.9 million for one of <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>'s famous paintings of water lilies. <ORGANIZATION> Aksa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese conglomerate, paid $ 6.8 million for <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>'s 1889 painting of a Breton boy in a landscape. The company owns 7 percent in <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction house, a Sotheby's rival The <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON> was one of five works that together brought nearly $ 17 million for the <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The museum recently sent 15 works to <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s for auction, saying they represented the private taste of the oil billionaire, who died in 1976. The museum said it will use the proceeds to acquire other works better suited to its collection and public display.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met today with Israeli Vice Premier <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and called for closer cooperation with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the highest-ranking Israeli official ever to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on the final day of a three-day trip that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was closely following reforms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and awaited a visit from the Solidarity leader. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> on Monday told <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> will restore relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, broken off 22 years ago. With reporters present at the start of today's meeting, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the nations `` should tighten our cooperation. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is pursuing reforms. In these reforms your participation is indispensable.'' One purpose of <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' visit was to improve economic cooperation between the countries. Polish trade with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will amount to $ 40 million this year, compared with $ 22.3 million last year. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was applying a method of indexing wages to prices similar to a policy used in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We can rely on and benefit from your experience,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also noted that Poles and Jews shared a common history. `` Let us remember this was a country of two peoples. The war destroyed the Jewish people and to this day we feel the shortage,'' he said. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had the largest Jewish population in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> until the Holocaust, in which 3 million of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Jews were killed. Nearly all the survivors emigrated after World War II. Earlier today, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where 2.5 million Jews were among the 4 million people who died there. There has been a steady warming in relations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in recent years, with senior officials, cultural figures and private groups exchanging visits. All <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> severed diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> following the 1967 Middle East War. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> on Sept. 18 became the first <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact country to fully restore relations. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has had low-level ties since 1986, allowing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to maintain a diplomatic office in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> renewed low-level relations last year.

 Searchers today found the bodies of two dogs that had been on a twin-engine plane missing off <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> but saw no sign of wreckage or the eight people aboard, authorities said. Authorities held out hope of finding survivors from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane that vanished Tuesday night on a 17-mile flight from <LOCATION> Block </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Westerly </LOCATION>. Searchers on land and in boats reported finding various debris, including a radio headset, a shoe, a life jacket, a fire extinguisher and a box of freight believed to have been aboard the plane. `` There's always a chance. That's why we're still looking,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brear </PERSON>. The dogs were found in <LOCATION> Block </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, about two miles northwest of the island, where two <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters and a dozen smaller boats were searching in water about 100 feet deep and as cold as 45 degrees overnight. The dogs belonged to passenger <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> woman who had a summer home on the island, said a friend, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Heineman </PERSON>, who came to the Westerly airport to await further word. The flight left at 6:20 p.m. and should have taken no more than 15 minutes, authorities said. The British <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Islander </PERSON> aircraft had about two hours of fuel, airline controller <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. There was no radio contact with pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> after takeoff, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. The airports involved do not have control towers, and <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, a former Naval aviator with about 10 years of experience on the <LOCATION> Block </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> route, would have navigated visually, the airline said. `` We're all just worried sick,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Scraug </PERSON>, a bartender on <LOCATION> Block </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` We're praying for everybody on that plane.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Block </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, said his wife, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, a real estate agent, was aboard on her way to a real estate class on the mainland. Others aboard included two construction workers and a man who worked at a restaurant on the island, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCombe </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Former Soviet POW Says Afghan Rebels Made Him Refuse to Come Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former Soviet prisoner of war who previously denied he wanted to come home said today he was forced to make that statement by the Afghan guerrillas who held him captive. Soviet Pvt. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopukh </PERSON>, 20, said at a news conference that anti-Communist rebel authorities warned him if he did n't say he had converted to Islam and wanted to stay with them, `` It would be all over.'' Lopukh and Pvt. <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokapchuk </PERSON> were released to their mothers Monday in an emotional ceremony in the Pakistani frontier city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, near the Afghan border. They were traded for 33 prisoners who had fought with the rebels. Soviet and rebel officials called the exchange a goodwill gesture. In their first public appearance since returning to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the soldiers told reporters they were not mistreated physically but that they had to convert to Islam or face death. <PERSON> Lopukh </PERSON> said he prayed five times a day and read the Koran but `` I did n't really accept Islam.'' <PERSON> Iona </PERSON> <PERSON> Andronov </PERSON>, spokesman for a group of POW families that helped negotiate the release, said hat `` accepting Islam is no betrayal of the motherland.'' Both young men, who were held for more than a year, said they were unarmed when they were captured _ <PERSON> Lopukh </PERSON> when he left camp to go after a watermelon he had seen in bushes and Prokapchuk when he wandered away to look around and got lost. <PERSON> Prokapchuk </PERSON> said he tried to escape and was beaten. Rebel fighters have intermittently released Soviet prisoners during the 10-year war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In December 1979, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sent more than 100,000 combat troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to replace one Communist government with another and crush a growing Moslem insurgency. The Soviets completed their pullout in February. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> says 310 men are still missing, but the rebels say they are holding no more than 75. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> continues to fund the Afghan government against the U.S.-supported rebels.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> resigned today after five years in power, clearing the way for opposition leaders to try to form a government. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, smiling and looking relaxed, said he was ready for the role of opposition leader. `` Absolutely,'' he said. `` We will be a very good watchdog.'' The opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s newly elected <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members planned to meet Friday to pick the man they hope will replace <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> as prime minister. The meeting had been scheduled for today, was postponed until Thursday and then Friday amid reported disagreements over who should be nominated. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have been gambling that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> would be hamstrung by internal squabbling that would pave the way for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to return to power. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> today decided not to stake a claim to form the government. Former defense and finance minister <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is the best-known leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the five-party alliance that deprived <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of a decisive majority in the new Parliament in the Nov. 22-26 elections. But the mild-mannered <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 58, has said he does not want to be prime minister and is content being the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the major component of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Another prominent Janata Dal member, <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shekhar </PERSON>, said Tuesday he was ready to take the prime minister's job but some of his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> colleagues were not enthusiastic about his candidacy. `` There will be trouble in the party if V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is not elected prime minister. Efforts to persuade him to contest are continuing,'' said <PERSON> Jaipal </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddy </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION>'s general secretaries. `` As of now, there is only one candidate,'' <PERSON> Reddy </PERSON> said. `` Despite persuasion V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is not a candidate and despite dissuasion <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shekhar </PERSON> remains one.'' <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shekhar </PERSON>, 62, was a chief architect of the 1977 <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> election triumph that ousted <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s mother and predecessor, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, from power for 29 months until her comeback in 1980. Most <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members switched to the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed in 1988. The 1977 election was the only time in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 42 years of independence that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> failed to win a majority in a parliamentary election. This year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> got more seats than any other party but fell far short of the majority needed for a government. The National Front got the second-highest number yet was able to muster the tacit support of other opposition parties, prompting it to boast it would be capable of forming a government. With 500 of the 525 parliamentary seats decided, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had 190 and its small-party allies 17 for a total of 207. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> had 130, and its allies had 132 for a total of 262. It takes 263 seats for a majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which is to convene with 525 elected seats. Another 18 seats are to be filled in elections that have been postponed indefinitely. The rest of the seats contested this month went to small parties and independents, most of whom have not declared their support for either the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, whose lackluster election showing followed charges that his government had tolerated corruption and ineptitude at high levels, will remain prime minister until a new one is accepted by President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON>. The 45-year-old former airline pilot submitted his resignation to <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> this morning. The president accepted but asked <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his Cabinet to remain in office until a new government is appointed, the presidential palace announced. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s resignation had been expected and was a formality that cleared the way for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> to try to form the next government, provided <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> asks it to do so. The constitution says it is up to the president to decide who should be asked to form a government. In the past, the decision was clear-cut because one party always won a comfortable majority. This time the president is free to go to the party he considers the most capable of forming a government. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders said Tuesday they were ready to enter into the secondary role of an opposition party and bide their time for a return to power. While <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was closeted with the president, election officials announced he had been elected to Parliament from his <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION> constituency for the third consecutive time. He defeated his nearest rival, <PERSON> Raj </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, grandson of Indian independence leader <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> by 197,000 votes, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said.

White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> `` is the top candidate ... and we'll announce it when we announce it.'' He declined to talk about <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>'s qualifications for the civil rights post, saying, `` We have n't made a selection yet.'' The civil rights job, occupied by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, has been vacant all year. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> stirred controversy with his forceful opposition to programs relying on racial preferences.

The panel, shrouded in controversy during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, had been facing extinction. <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> is credited with helping reform the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s prison system after the deadly riot at <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> in 1971. He went to <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION> and was critical of Gov. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>'s handling of the riot. Thirty-nine <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION> inmates and guards were killed when <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> sent in heavily armed state police to retake the prison; a guard and three inmates were also killed during the uprising. The sources, who insisted on anonymity, said <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> was undergoing a background clearance check before the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> formally announces the nomination. That check could take up to two months. <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>, a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in September after a 24-year career in which he rose to deputy majority leader. He returned to practice law in <LOCATION> Uniondale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, after losing a race for majority leader in the Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. A secretary who answered the telephone at <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>'s office said: `` The senator has no comments and is referring all calls to the people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' `` If the president has to pick a Republican, he could n't pick a more decent person than <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, an old friend of <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> has the legal experience and training `` that the previous candidate lacked.''

Ninety-six countries voted in favor and 14 abstained. Earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> threatened to cut funds to the agency if the measure passed. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative to the organization, demanded a roll call vote and told the conference it `` should not allow this precedent by presenting highly political issues.'' `` If that occurs, the <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> will cease to be effective.'' An Israeli delegate said his country supported giving technical assistance to the Arabs in the occupied territories `` but why does it have to be in collaboration with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, a very political organization.'' A <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative said, `` We were trying to depict reality in the occupied territories. ... I do not wish to talk about politics.'' The resolution expresses opposition `` to the Israeli confiscation of Palestinian land and expropriation of Palestinian water resources.'' It calls on the food organization to provide `` the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people with the assistance necessary for their economic development in close cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.'' The assistance could include such things as studies of soil, water and food storage, as well as suggestions on how to improve food-growing skills. The resolution also asks that the agency include Israeli-occupied territories in future programs `` and in line with the present cooperation and coordination between the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and other U.N. agencies.'' The resolution also calls for free access by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> staff members to occupied <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> territory. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> had written to the <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> director-general, <PERSON> Eduoard </PERSON> <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON>, a Lebanese, to say that there was considerable concern over the issue in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it had no objection to the <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> becoming involved in projects in the territories, but `` it would be ill-advised for the organization to do so in such a way as to involve itself in the geo-political process.'' This week, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations plan to push a resolution through the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> recognizing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a nation. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has threatened to cut off all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> if the plan winds approval. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as in other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies, is assessed 25 percent of the food organization budget, set last week at $ 568.8 million for the next two years.

 Dry, desert winds howling through <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pushed flames across acres of brush and downed power lines, cutting electricity to thousands. `` It's blowing like mad,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officer <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anas </LOCATION> are back with us again.'' The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds reached 70 mph and accompanied regular winds of 35 mph overnight at the <LOCATION> Rialto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Nearby in the <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, wind ranged from 40 mph to 60 mph, forcing trucks, campers and vans to stop on the shoulder of Interstate 15 and wait for gusts to lessen, the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> said. Part of the interstate was all but closed Tuesday morning as dirt and sand kicked up by the wind reduced visibility to almost zero. The weather station in <LOCATION> Sandberg </LOCATION>, about 60 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, reported steady winds of 30 to 35 mph Tuesday night, with gusts to 45 mph. Earlier Tuesday, winds fanned a brush fire in northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> that blackened more than 3,000 acres, destroyed several structures and forced the evacuation of schools and homes. The blaze was 60 percent contained today and residents were allowed back in their homes, authorities said. About 50 homes at the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> were evacuated when a fire in a manure pile near the station's horse stables ignited and was fanned by high winds, said base spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>. No one was hurt and no structures burned in the early morning blaze. Residents were allowed back into their homes within two hours. Power outages caused by wind affected 40,000 customers in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> counties. Power was restored to all but a few users by Tuesday afternoon. About 5,000 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> customers also were blacked out Tuesday. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist, said the winds were expected to decrease today as a high pressure system over <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> weakens. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds typically are caused when a high-pressure system forms over the northern Rocky Mountain states while a low-pressure system hovers over <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Air rushing across the Western deserts from high to low pressure heats up and dries out, and then roars through mountain passes around the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> basin.

 Tank-led Syrian forces took up combat positions facing troops of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> in and around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today in apparent preparation for an attack to drive him from the presidential palace. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has refused to cede the palace to the country's newly elected president, who fired <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> on Tuesday as Christian army commander. The general ordered his 20,000 soldiers on maximum alert and fortified his defenses around the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, commander of the Lebanese Forces coalition of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militias, declared support for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and said his 6,000 fighters would `` defend the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> areas to the last minute of our lives.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> does not recognize President <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, a Maronite Catholic like himself, and pledges to keep up his efforts to drive Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main powerbroker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, supports <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>. Thirty right-wing French parliamentarians arrived in the Christian enclave today and met with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> at the presidential palace. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s television said the lawmakers `` relayed to the general the support of the French people for his steadfastness'' and joined an estimated 15,000 youths in a sit-in around the palace in support of the general. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. In an interview with the French radio station <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> 1, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said he was willing to reach a compromise with the Syrians. `` I invite <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to undertake negotiations toward an end that safeguards the minimum, fundamental rights of the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people,'' he said. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has repeatedly offered to negotiate with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for the withdrawal of all of its forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Syrians have rejected the offers. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has recognized <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s government and the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> `` will not be on the side of those who would assume the responsibility of again taking up violence. Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military sources said the Syrians deployed T-55 tanks in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and T-62 tanks in the mountainous fronts. Dozens of Soviet-designed T-55 tanks rolled into the slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Tuesday night, taking up combat positions opposite <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces, said one military source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Residents of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said fighters of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, withdrew from the various positions thay had manned along the front line in that sector. `` Hundreds of Syrian soldiers moved in. The front in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> is now fully controlled by the Syrians,'' said one resident. The Syrians, according to military sources, also deployed mortars and recoilless cannons in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in addition to howitzers and multi-barreled rocket launchers in the mountains overlooking the city. `` It's a significant buildup, the kind of measures that precede a major battle,'' one military source said. The sources said the Syrian tanks were `` in combat formation. It seems they are only waiting for the orders.'' He said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces have planted thousands of anti-armor and anti-personnel mines in the valleys separating the Christian enclave from the Syrian positions. Mines have been planted on all the bridges and narrow mountain roads linking the Christian enclave with the rest of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the source added. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces also have deployed scores of anti-aircraft batteries around strategic locations to confront a possible landing of airborne forces. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on Tuesday poured at least 15,000 troops into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> backed by artillery, tanks and rocket launchers. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> on Tuesday fired <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and replaced him with Adm. <PERSON> Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahoud </PERSON>, also a Maronite, who called on soldiers following <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to join the new command. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> called <PERSON> Lahoud </PERSON> a deserter and vowed to fight to the death. The rebellious 54-year-old general refused to relinquish the presidential palace. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian forces battled the Syrians for six months before the artillery duels ended Sept. 22 with an Arab League-brokered cease-fire. He rejects a peace accord approved by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last month that provided for greater Moslem participation in the government because it did not set a timetable for withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops in the country. Civil war broke out in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1975. The Syrian forces entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate, then sided with the Moslems in the war, which has claimed 150,000 lives. Before the peace plan was adopted, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and Moslem Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> had led competing Christian and Moslem governments for 14 months.

 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> says the dialogue between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will be jeopardized if the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> recognizes the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as a nation. Debate on the Palestinian problem opens today in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, where Arab nations planned to introduce a resolution Thursday that would raise the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s status from an observer organization to a non-voting nation, like <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has threatened to cut off all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> if the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> approves the step. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is assessed $ 216 million annually, one-fourth of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> move `` has serious consequences for the peace process in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, our ongoing dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, a lot of very important issues, issues that I would say should be much more important to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> than the mere change on a nameplate here in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> today, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> ignored <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> objections and voted overwhelmingly to help the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> teach Palestinians how to grow food in Israeli-occupied territories. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has threatened to cut funds to the organization if the measure passed. Since <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism last year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has held talks with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. Arab League Ambassador <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> group was determined to go ahead with the move to change the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s status in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, but that negotiations would continue with other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> rejected any compromise, saying, `` We are clearly not interested in exploring all the alternatives. `` We are interested in finding a way to end this particular silly idea that the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> can be declared a state here in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> when they have none of the attributes of a state.'' European and Nordic diplomats, who often play a buffer role in the recurring U.S.-PLO confrontations, worked on a compromise prior to the showdown vote Friday, but said privately they had little hope. Upgrading the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s status would take a simple majority vote of the 159 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> members. As a member of the 102-member non-aligned movement, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has more than enough votes to prevail. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declared the existence of a state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> says 117 nations have recognized it. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is obligated to pay its <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> dues even if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is recognized as `` Palestine.'' He rejected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> threat of non-payment and commented, `` Sometimes I think I have the impression that the <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> think that they're making a loan. The Americans ought to pay what they owe.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s firmest ally in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, calls the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist organization and refuses to negotiate with it.

<HEAD>Specter of Repo Man Looms in Peewee Team's Nightmare Road Trip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nightmarish Thanksgiving trip of two suburban peewee football teams turned more bizarre with word that a team bus thought to have been stolen from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> parking lot was actually repossessed. During the five-day trip, the young players and their chaperones faced repeated bus breakdowns, sleepless nights, a shortened trip to <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> and two humiliating losses in football. The lowlight of the trip may have been the disappearance of one of three buses used to transport the team, along with $ 2,200 in donated cash, radios, cameras, jackets and other personal possessions on board. The bus vanished from the parking lot of an Orlando-area high school during the second of two <ORGANIZATION> Pop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> football games involving the teams. Many of the 116 group members were left stranded in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> and forced to buy airline or bus tickets back to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Team officials discovered Tuesday that the bus had been repossessed and was parked at the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> compound in <LOCATION> Winter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported today. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> official in Winter Garden said he found $ 2,209 in cash on the bus but little else. `` If we can get the $ 2,200 back, it would be a thrill,'' said <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Whited </PERSON>, president of the teams. `` We were left high and dry.'' Whited blamed the repossession on <ORGANIZATION> Falcon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motorcoach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which provided the group with the buses, two of which broke down repeatedly on the trip. But <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, one of Falcon's owners, said his company is not to blame because he had leased the bus from another company, <ORGANIZATION> B </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; B Tours, in south suburban <LOCATION> Markham </LOCATION>. B & amp; B officials, in turn, said they had leased the bus from yet another firm _ Grand Tour by <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. _ and had no idea the company was behind on payments and that the bus might be repossessed. B & amp; B repairs buses, among other things. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a manager of B & amp; B, said that his company had repaired the bus that was repossessed but that Grand Tour had n't paid the bill. Grand Tour had made arrangements for B & amp; B to use the bus as partial payment for the work. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said it's a common for companies that own buses to employ repossessors to reclaim the vehicles when payments are overdue. `` These guys ride around all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to the hotspots where buses might be, and when they see the bus, they snatch it,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today. Officials at Grand Tour by <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. The company's telephone was disconnected. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Yochum </PERSON>, an official at <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Faribault </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, refused to comment about the repossession. `` It's a private business transaction,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Seven years after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sought to improve government management, major problems still are ignored or corrected slowly, leaving a `` seemingly never-ending'' multibillion-dollar legacy of waste, a watchdog agency said today. `` Management deficiencies, program abuses and illegal activities cost the taxpayers billions of dollars and undermine their confidence in government,'' the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. `` This situation is unacceptable under any circumstance but becomes even more serious in light of overwhelming budget deficits,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s chief, Comptroller General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing today that the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> had taken recent steps to demand improved agency management but alone could not do enough. And he laid much of the blame for mismanagement on the deregulation and domestic budget cuts during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He said those steps were taken without a plan to improve oversight of the private sector's spending of government money. `` We have been penny-wise and really pound foolish,'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said it found that myriad examples of mismanagement, fraud, waste and abuse had been uncovered in annual assessments of government agencies required under the 1982 Financial Integrity Act. But many of the problems persist years after being identified, the report said, blaming a lack of agency leadership, shortsighted decision-making and a failure of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to aggressively oversee government management. `` There is a seemingly never-ending and costly trail of mismanagement, abuse and illegal acts involving federal programs,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said in the report to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most of the problems are known, and in many instances have been known for years, but they remain uncorrected.'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> had decided to launch a government-wide review to identify areas most ripe for abuse. He called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to expand its oversight and to demand evidence of improved financial management as part of the budget-writing process. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also suggested a businesslike approach to government management, recommending creation of a chief financial officer for the government as a whole and for each major agency, and requiring them to submit detailed annual reports to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and to outside auditors. <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> warned against using budget deficits as an excuse not to deal with the problems, many of which he blamed on `` second-rate'' and World War II-era financial management systems. But he said the new financial systems needed to correct the problems would ultimately pay for themselves. <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> and the report cited a litany of spending blunders by the government, some of them previously cited in prior <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reports, and said many were made in attempts to improve program management. The report noted the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 230 million before halting installation of an automated financial management system, originally intended to cost $ 33 million, but whose cost estimate grew to a staggering $ 479 million. Also, it cited the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to abandon, after spending $ 187 million, a $ 1.8 billion automated tax return examination system. The report said government spending on information technology and management has nearly doubled to $ 17 million since the Financial Integrity Act was passed in 1982 but that there is little coordination between government agencies when they seek to improve their management systems. `` Invariably, these systems do not work as planned, have cost overruns of millions and even hundreds of millions of dollars, and are not developed on time,'' the report said. As examples, the report cited: _ <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> projections that its 1988 losses were $ 860 million A later private audit put the pricetag at $ 4.2 billion. _ The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>' inability to identify and collect more than $ 50 billion in delinquent taxes, roughly 64 percent of the $ 89 billion owed the government but uncollected despite the mounting deficits The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study found that 50 percent of the managers charged with conducting the internal management reviews required by the 1982 law had not been trained to properly do so.

 Thousands of Italians waving small <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> flags greeted <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> today as he prepared for a historic meeting with the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and became the first Soviet Communist Party chief to make an official visit here. On Tuesday, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said the pope planned to ask for establishment of permanent ties between the Holy See and the Kremlin. Premier <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> welcomed the Soviet president shortly after his Ilyushin-62 touched down at <LOCATION> Leonardo </LOCATION> da Vinci airport on a sunny <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> morning. The two leaders inspected an honor guard and a 21-gun salute rang out. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a blue overcoat and gray fedora, shook hands with a line of Italian officials before his motorcade departed for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador's residence, <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> <PERSON> Abamelek </PERSON>, where he and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, are staying. Thousands cheered <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as his motorcade traveled a short while later to the Renaissance presidential palace for a meeting with President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>. Sharpshooters were posted on buildings along the route. Crowds chanted `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>! <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>!'' and `` Bravo, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON>, bravo!'' A group of young people burst into the strains of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internationale </ORGANIZATION>, thrusting their fists into the air. `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>, you are a beautiful man,'' one bystander yelled. While not as effusive as the popular welcome given the Soviet president in other Western European countries, it was a rare public tribute to a foreign leader in the Italian capital. The three-day visit comes just before the U.S.-Soviet summit off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. Italian officials say they hope to get in `` the last European word'' before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> heads into his talks with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> later joined a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in central <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and went on a whirlwind tour of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s famous sights, including the Colosseum. His first contact with the Roman public was at the central <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON> <PERSON> Venezia </PERSON>, the square where fascist dictator <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> once stirred crowds from his office balcony. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> smiled and waved as thousands cheered and waved plastic Soviet flags. The talks in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> were expected to focus on <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s leaders have now joined <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> in bowing to public pressure and rejecting hard-line communism. As the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visit began, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> office issued an appeal for the release of seven Soviet political prisoners, including one it said was detained for religious activities. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> meets Friday with the Polish-born <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in the first such encounter between a pope, leader of the world's 850 million Roman Catholics, and a Soviet Communist Party chief. On the eve of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s arrival, <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said the pope would press for diplomatic relations with the Kremlin. The statement was a dramatic indication of the improvement in relations between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and the Soviet government, which once tried to abolish religious practice. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is popular among Italians for his reform programs, and Italian-Soviet relations have been good in recent years. The government is eager to help <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> overcome the economic crisis that his reforms have not resolved. About $ 3.3 billion worth of agreements between Italian private and public industry and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are being concluded in connection with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit. The Fiat auto giant announced Tuesday the signing of a joint venture agreement to produce 300,000 cars a year in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The visit comes as <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s own <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, is moving toward changing its name and becoming a social democratic grouping. The Italian Communists regularly win more than 25 percent of the vote. <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> prettied up for the visit, repaving roads and cleaning building facades. `` Welcome to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'' read red posters put up by the <ORGANIZATION> Italy-Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The government planned to showcase <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s famed cuisine at a state dinner, with a menu that included small ravioli stuffed with truffles, gilt-bream fish Sicilian-style, and fruit and eggnog cream, along with wines and spumanti.

The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> dismantled a major program, the 1988 catastrophic health care system, which sank under an anti-tax backlash. They then pasted together a $ 14.7 billion budget deficit reduction measure with a good deal of whole cloth, in the form of fiscal shell games, and -LRB- hush -RRB- some $ 6 billion in various `` revenue enhancements'' -LRB- i.e., tax increases -RRB-. ... Sustantial progress was made on new programs such as the Clean Air Act and child care. And the escalating demands of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law may compel -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to do something he failed to do this year; to lay a coherent fiscal program before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in January. ... At the outset, the new president had lots of good will in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but he lost several big ones in his first year, including his fight to fulfill a major campaign pledge, the capital gains -LRB- tax -RRB- cut, and his selection for secretary of defense, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> -LRB- a blessing in disguise, since he got the able <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> instead -RRB-. And he may have tripped himself up politically with his hard-line position against public funding for abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. ... The challenge for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to develop a congressional agenda with clear direction and to demonstrate a willingness to support his kinder, gentler leanings with the necessary money.

 Nov. 27 The News and <PERSON> Courier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> blast probe: Since the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- own investigator made his original report, he has changed his explanation of what triggered the blast. At first, he said it was an electronic detonator; he now says it probably was a chemical device. Yet even before the April tragedy, crewmen and their families had been reporting accidents on board the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, incidents not mentioned in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s report. There are conflicting stories about <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> -LRB- who died in the blast and was blamed -RRB-. Some of his shipmates regarded him as depressed, others did not; others said he was looking forward to his new assignment in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and that he lacked the technical expertise to construct the kind of device that allegedly caused the explosion. And, too, there are disturbing questions about how the investigation itself was conducted: At least one seaman said he was threatened with severe retribution by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators if he did n't tell the story they wanted him to. As a result, the armed services committees of both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> have launched special inquiries into the explosion, as has the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. Also under examination is the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of its own investigation. The inquiries are more than justified. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> may indeed turn out to be correct in its conclusions. But the evidence and the methods used by the service raise fears that rather than pursuing the truth, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators sought to shift blame for the tragedy from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to a seaman no longer here to defend himself.

It goes for weapons to keep the people in line and to keep the thugs in charge, in charge. It is not a question of maintaining ourselves as some kind of moderating influence, moving a nation toward democracy, or at least away from official murder. We have no influence in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. We ca n't even get murderers arrested. It is not a question of fending off communism, the world's most overrated threat. The very fact of our providing aid to oppressors provides the only soil in which communism seems to thrive. ... The only question that matters is one the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration refuse to consider ...: Should the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> give aid and comfort to those who are slaughtering their own citizens?

Even under the most inhumane geopolitical standard, our involvement has done nothing but make things worse and to up the ante in lives. We are co-conspirators with murderers.

 Nov. 26 Central Maine Morning Sentinel, <LOCATION> Waterville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, on U.S.-Salvador: Even in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, where the only thing more chronic than war and violence is poverty, last week's murder ... of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and the housekeeper's daughter was shockingly savage. The six massacred Jesuits were scholars and teachers and political activists, part of what has become known as `` liberation theology.'' They opposed the right-wing <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> government, which has denounced the murders and pledged to bring the perpetrators to justice. Despite that pledge, the murders have stretched <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Salvadoran government to its limit.

But should the aid have been suspended? Not this time, not for this incident. Foreign policy, liberal or conservative, should not be dictated by reactions to single incidents of violence. Decisions should be made after careful consideration of the broader situation. And the broader situation in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is both violent and muddy.

 The military government met with an opposition political party for the first time and repeated its pledge to hold free elections in May, a party source said today. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> authorities said <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government troops have launched their first big attack in four months on two rebel camps near the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border. A member of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> that Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Khin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyunt </PERSON>, the second-ranking government official, held an hour of talks Tuesday with the party's general secretary, <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> <PERSON> Han </PERSON> The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, quoted <PERSON> Khin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyunt </PERSON> as saying the government has ordered officials at all levels to be strictly neutral in the election. The military junta came to power in a September 1988 coup in which soldiers killed hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators. In recent months the junta has cracked down again on the opposition. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and Tin Oo, the leaders of the popular opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, were put under house arrest July 20. Of the 206 political parties registered to take part in the elections, six have developed a national network. They include the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It was not immediately known why <PERSON> Khin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyunt </PERSON> met only with an official of the Union Nationals. In the northern Thai town of <LOCATION> Mae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sot </LOCATION>, a border patrol police officer said <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> forces fired mortar and artillery guns at two camps of the ethnic <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> rebels. The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the offensive began Tuesday night just across the border from <LOCATION> Mae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sot </LOCATION>. He said 2,000 rebels were defending the camps against about 4,000 government soldiers. The officer said he had no information on casualties. The Karens withstood a fierce government offensive in late July. The ethnic minority is one of the strongest of a dozen guerrilla groups fighting for greater regional autonomy.

In a speech to his besieged comrades just before the mass capitulation, ... <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said that perhaps they had `` underestimated completely the processes taking place in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and especially <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and their effect and influence on our society.''

 Nov. 26 <ORGANIZATION> Oshkosh </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION> -RRB- Northwestern on drug use and student grants: There is a bit of resentment on college campuses these days because Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> is insisting on an oath of no drug use @ dealing in order to get federal student grants. It is not unlike the requirement a few years ago that students must comply with the requirements of the selective service law before they could have grants. The main point is that those federal grants to students are not something to which the students are entitled as a right. It makes sense that a government which is appropriating large amounts of money in a war on drugs should see to it that other federal money is not being spent at cross-purposes. The issue is larger than Pell Grants to students, though. The issue is whether there should be attached qualifications for grants in general. Of course there should. ... If the grant is for education, it would be silly if the grant were not made with an attached string, for instance, that the money be used for education. And it is entirely reasonable that the government requires the recipients to maintain a clear record, whether clear of felonies or clear of drug-related offenses.

His words should pierce the conscience of every congressman who has voted against a sensible seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases. The bill is nothing more than an attempt to keep mentally deranged people and outright criminals from legally buying handguns. It is not designed to keep any lawabiding citizen in -LRB- his -RRB- right mind from owning a gun. Now, let the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and other groups come forward claiming gun-control backers are unpatriotic wimps. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> puts the lie to that absurd claim. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> casts the issue in a clear light that must be considered.

 Nov. 26 The <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal on faith and spiritual values: Baby boomers who filled church and synagogue pews as children in the 1950s are returning to the fold with their children. This is good news, indeed, for a nation that often struggles awkwardly with religion and the crucial role it plays in our lives. In a study presented to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION>, sociologists <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Roof </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roozen </PERSON> found that 40 percent of those born between 1945 and 1954 said they were attending worship services regularly last year. Only 33 percent of this same generation reported regular attendance in the early 1970s. Perhaps they are discovering or rediscovering the imph and spiritual values _ not only for themselves and their families but for society as a whole. What can be more basic, more fundamental, than one's thoughts and beliefsortance of fait about God? That relationship _ no matter whether one is an atheist, agnostic or devoted to God through a particular faith _ is key to how we think about ourselves and others, and how we think about the here and the hereafter. And yet some people, be they believers or atheists, try to pretend that religion is something separate. Something reserved for a Saturday or Sunday. They lump religion with politics and sex as subjects of conversation to avoid. ... It haslaw is necessary to encourage parental involvement and protect minors' health. About half the states have laws requiring parental consent, but most of the laws have been invalidated after court challenges. Groups on both sides of the abortion issue had looked to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> this term to help clarify its allegiance to <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. But the settlement of the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case involving strict regulations on abortion clinics may eliminate the greatest immediate threat to that 1973 decision. The Illinois settlement still must be approved by a federal judge. However, the court's decisions in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> cases, expected by July, still are sure to pack an enormous impact. Nationwide, about 40 percent of the nearly 1 million teen-agers who become pregnant each year seek abortions. Of the 1.5 million legal abortions performed annually since 1973, about 12 percent _ 180,000 each year _ have been for minors. The court touched off a political firestorm in July by voting 5-4 to give states greater power to regulate abortions. Four justices appeared ready to go even further and overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> refused. But she has been critical of the 1973 ruling and has not discounted the chance she someday would vote to reverse it. Neither <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> is asking the court to reverse <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has. Although it did not seek to participate in today's arguments, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urged the court to use the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> case to rule that women have no constitutional right to abortion. `` We continue to believe that <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> was wrongly decided and should be overruled,'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said in a friend-of-the-court brief. The disputed <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law was passed by the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 but never took effect, due to a successful legal challenge by an <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> abortion clinic and one of its doctors, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaujean </PERSON>. The law would have required any doctor asked to perform an abortion on an unmarried girl under 18 to contact one of the girl's parents at least 24 hours before the operation A young girl could seek to bypass parental notification by seeking a state judge's permission to have the abortion. A federal judge struck down the law, and that ruling was upheld by the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law requires such young girls to notify both biological parents at least 48 hours before obtaining an abortion. The 1981 law makes doctors criminally liable for violations. After enforcement of the law was blocked, a judicial-bypass provision took effect. It allows a girl to avoid notifying her parents by convincing a judge she is `` mature and capable of giving informed consent'' or that not notifying her parents would be in her best interests. The notification law with the judicial-bypass option was in effect in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> for five years before it was struck down by a federal judge. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed that ruling last year and said the law is constitutional. The appeals court, however, blocked enforcement of the law pending <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> action. The cases are <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, 88-805, and <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, 88-1125 and 88-1309.

<TEXT>
 Mothers Against Drunk Driving, known as <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION>, wants a federal judge to stop a fathers' group called <ORGANIZATION> Mad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dads </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to stop using that name. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION> sought unspecified money for alleged damage to its efforts to promote the interests of people opposed to drunken driving. <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION> contends Mad Dads is trading on the goodwill <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION> has built up, and the similarity of the names is likely to confuse the public. The lawsuit alleges violation of <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION>'s service mark, registered in 1983 with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trademark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, according to court documents. <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION> also said it owns the service mark `` I'm a MADD Dad,'' which was registered Nov. 7. <ORGANIZATION> Mad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dads </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was formed this year to discourage use of alcohol and illegal drugs by young people and prevent gang-related crime in the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> area. Spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said the organization does not want to fight with <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION>, but does not want to change its name. `` Mad Dads depicts what we are all about, parents at the grass-roots level trying to combat the gang and drug problem in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> and outside <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. An attorney for Mad Dads, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, said a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law firm that represents <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION> refused his written suggestion of a meeting of representatives of the two groups. Of the claim for money, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said, `` Mad Dads doe n't have much money. All we have is firm commitment and determination.''

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Klasavich </PERSON> speaks no Russian and <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Enikeeva </PERSON> speaks no English, but that will not stop the American from marrying the Soviet next month. Klasavich of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> plans to fly to Archangel, a Soviet city near the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>, to marry the woman he met on a trip in June to improve U.S.-Soviet relations. `` Everybody thinks I'm crazy except the people who were on that trip,'' he said. `` They understand perfectly how this could happen.'' <PERSON> Klasavich </PERSON> and 42 other Mainers spent four days in <LOCATION> Archangel </LOCATION> as part of the sister-city exchange between <LOCATION> Greater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> port city of about 400,000 people. `` You would have thought we were royalty there,'' <PERSON> Klasavich </PERSON> said. `` They were the warmest and friendliest people that I've ever met.'' The wedding has generated so much excitement in Archangel that it may be broadcast on the city's television station, and the mayor will be at the reception, said <PERSON> Klasavich </PERSON>, a telephone equipment installer. It took only one day and a river cruise for <PERSON> Klasavich </PERSON>, 44, and <PERSON> Enikeeva </PERSON>, 23, to know that something was happening between them. He returned to Archangel four months later and won support from <PERSON> Enikeeva </PERSON>' a mother and grandmother before he dropped to one knee in front of the family and asked her to marry him. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration officials estimate it will be at least three months after the wedding before Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> red tape can be cleared to bring Enikeeva and her 4-year-old son from a previous marriage to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where they intend to live. He said he sometimes wonders how they will manage without an interpreter, whether their age difference is too great and whether she is marrying him only to get out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as some of his friends have suggested. But he says, `` I ca n't stand the idea of living without her. It's that simple.''

 Two survivors of a fiery church bus crash testified today that they dived over a pile of fellow passengers jamming an emergency door to escape the flames after the bus collided head-on with a pickup truck. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Obregon </PERSON> took the witness stand on the fifth day of the trial of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, the driver of the pickup. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 36, is charged with 27 counts of murder, 12 of assault, 42 of wanton endangerment and one of drunken driving in what authorities say is the nation's worst alcohol-related traffic accident. The truck was driving in the wrong lane at the time of the 1988 accident, which left 24 youngsters and three adults dead and 13 people injured. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Hendersonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, testified he jumped over a pile of people to escape flames and growing heat inside the bus owned by the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of God church in <LOCATION> Radcliff </LOCATION>. The bus was returning from an outing to a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> amusement park. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> said someone held his feet and he was `` hanging upside down outside of the bus ... face at the bumper.'' `` I did not know how much longer it would be before it would blow up,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Obregon </PERSON>, 17, was asked if more people could have escaped if there had been more exits. She tearfully replied, `` Yes.'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> remained stoic throughout the morning proceedings, his eyes fixed on a table he shared with his attorneys. On Tuesday he wept as a witness described seeing a fellow passenger engulfed in flames cry, `` Oh Lord, I'm coming home.'' Testimony from more passengers was expected today, said the prosecutor, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. On Tuesday, another teen-age survivor, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON>, recounted the panic on the church bus after the 10:55 p.m. collision on Interstate 71 about five miles south of <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION> `` I looked up and seen nothing but flames and fire,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON>, 17, of <PERSON> Radcliff </PERSON>. She broke down in sobs, prompting Circuit Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> to call a brief recess. Afterward, Miss <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON> recalled seeing <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Kytta </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, engulfed in flames in the former school bus' stairwell. `` I saw our youth leader raise his hands and say ` Oh Lord, I'm coming home,''' Miss <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kytta </PERSON> was one of 24 young people who died. His father and two other adults also died. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> broke down during the graphic testimony of Coroner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, who described the bodies found inside the bus. Families of the victims clasped hands tightly and dabbed tears with handkerchiefs during <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s testimony. `` I could n't believe what I had seen,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. `` I thought I was having a nightmare.'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s sobbing prompted <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> to order a recess. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> also broke into tears Monday as witnesses described the screams and agony of the injured and dying. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldani </PERSON>, a defense attorney, said during a recess he did n't know what effect <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s sobbing would have on the jury. `` It's nothing staged. I'm sure they do n't think that,'' <PERSON> Baldani </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s lawyers began building their case that the bus carrying 67 people was unsafe. Before the crash, some passengers climbed over seats to sit with friends and others were lying in the aisles, according to testimony from survivors. `` It's no secret that's a big factor in our favor,'' <PERSON> Baldani </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Americans' suspicions of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s motives are fading rapidly, with a majority of people now convinced that the Soviets do not seek to dominate the world, a national poll has found As Presidents <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> prepare for their weekend summit off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, the poll found overwhelming belief that the Soviet leader seeks real reform in his country, although opinion was mixed on his prospects. Both men were highly popular in the Media General-Associated Press poll, with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> out-polling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> among the most-educated Americans. A plurality said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has done more than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to ease East-West tensions. Their meeting comes at a moment of great change in the Communist world. While <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pushes liberal reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, his <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European allies have taken dramatic steps toward democracy in recent weeks. Forty percent of the 1,117 adults surveyed Nov. 17-25 rated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` too cautious'' in encouraging reform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Still, 46 percent said he was doing enough; the rest were unsure. Respondents by a 2-1 margin favored establishing normal trade relations with the Soviets, a step that administration officials are exploring. A far less likely move, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid to the Soviets, was soundly opposed. Despite good will toward <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> personally, the poll found lingering doubt about Soviet reliability, with 53 percent saying the Soviets can not be trusted to live up to their arms control agreements. The level of doubt was down, though, from 61 percent in a poll last year. Reflecting the cautious view, 52 percent in the new poll said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not significantly reduce military spending because of lessening East-West tensions. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is contemplating sizable cuts in its military budget. Respondents were divided on whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should remove all of its troops from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if the Soviets removed theirs from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Of those who had an opinion, 47 percent favored such a deal and 42 percent were opposed, a split within the poll's 3-point error margin. By a 68-25 percent margin, respondents opposed immediate cuts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a response to reforms in the East. But among those who opposed cuts, a majority said they would favor troop reductions later if the reforms continue. On the broadest East-West issue, respondents by a 57-35 percent margin rejected the notion that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is trying to dominate the world, with the rest unsure. Just last spring, 50 percent in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll said they believed the Soviets did seek world domination. Despite the divided opinion on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s caution in encouraging the Communist changes, 74 percent approved of his handling of U.S.-Soviet relations overall. And 70 percent had a favorable opinion of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in general, the same high level of popularity he enjoyed in a Gallup poll in May. Sixty-eight percent expressed a favorable view of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, virtually the same rating as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s and well up from 54 percent in a Media General-AP poll in April 1988, before a summit between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Moreover, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was more popular than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ an 85 percent favorable rating, compared to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 65 percent _ among respondents with postgraduate educations. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also outscored <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> among this group in 1988. In another measure of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s strong position, 41 percent said he has done more than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to ease East-West tensions, while 29 percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has done more. Thirty percent were unsure. The high regard for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> translated into a generally optimistic view of his chances: Among the 77 percent who believed he seeks meaningful reform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 60 percent expected him to succeed, 15 percent said he is likely to fail and a quarter were unsure of the outcome. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Stonemason Invents Tombstones to Stand up Against Quakes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A stonemason has patented a tombstone designed to keep standing through severe earthquakes, saving high replacement costs in a country where elaborate, expensive markers reflect deep respect for ancestors. `` My earthquake-proof tombstones can resist even a temblor as strong as the Great Kanto Earthquake,'' said <PERSON> Toshihiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagoya </PERSON>, 41. The 1923 earthquake, estimated at 7.9 on the Richter scale, destroyed much of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, then a city of 2 million people, and killed 140,000. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s population is now 12 million. The new tombstone uses stainless steel poles implanted in the center, and its parts are pressed together with <LOCATION> Nagoya </LOCATION>'s special glue. He tested it with the help of <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s seismology department. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, sitting along a major geological fault, is hit by hundreds of quakes annually, although most are too weak to be felt. The idea for the new tombstone came after <LOCATION> Nagoya </LOCATION> inspected the wreckage of statues and tombstones _ some costing nearly $ 70,000 _ after a strong earthquake two years ago in <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Almost everything was destroyed at many temples and graveyards I visited,'' he said. More stunning was the death of a woman hit by a falling stone lantern in the quake, measured at 6.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The new quake-resistant tombstone would not cost much more than the normal price of up to $ 35,000, he said. Existing tombstones can be made quake-resistant for about $ 1,045, he added.

The guerillas burned a mansion blocks away from the official residence of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. The early morning attacks were in the affluent <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION> neighborhood, where the rebels last week took over a <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, entrapping six <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berets </ORGANIZATION> during a 27-hour standoff with government forces. It was not immediately clear if today's fighting signaled the resumption of a major guerrilla offensive on the capital that began Nov. 11 and appeared to have ended when the rebels withdrew Nov. 22. Residents of the affluent <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION> neighborhood said they heard several loud explosions near the fortified complex between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> first announced the attacks, saying he had little information, as he was being questioned about reported harsh tactics in a crackdown by the rightist government of U.S.-backed President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. Asked about the raids by <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s government on church and labor offices, the arrests of civilians and other tactics of the counteroffensive crackdown, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Our response is that we deplore violence and killing on both sides.'' Pressed as to whether the administration had communicated any concerns to the <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> government, he said, `` We have made our views known to both sides publicly and privately that we are opposed to the killing and the violence there.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly voiced strong support for <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> in the war against the Marxist rebels. For his part, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters that, with regard to reports of right-wing death squad activity, `` I think its important that they do everything they can to get control of that kind of activity.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> appeared to take a softer approach today to the arrest of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> church worker, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, by the Salvadoran police than on Monday when he had said `` there are indications'' that she was involved with a cache of weapons found buried in the backyard of her residence in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. He said she would be charged with illegal explosives and weapons. When the police arrived at her house on Sunday, she telephoned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consul general, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. A consular officer went immediately to her home and stayed with her during her arrest and through that night. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that during her four years in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> had become `` known to embassy ofifcials thorugh her work with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> education sminars and coordinating non ofifcial delgations to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` We have been monitoring her case closely to assure she is well treated. ... The embassy will continue to assure that she is given every benefit due her under Salvadoran law.''

<HEAD>FCC Says Local Telephone Companies May Have to Refund $75 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Local telephone companies may have to refund as much as $ 75 million to long-distance companies and large private-line business customers, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says. The local phone companies accumulated overcharges between 1985 and 1988 under <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> guidelines that allowed prices of these high-capacity private-line services to exceed the phone companies' costs of providing the services The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> ordered a refund Tuesday as it considered challenges to the special pricing scheme, which the local phone companies provide for long-distance companies or large business customers. The commission voted 4-0 that the scheme was legal during the 1985-88 period, when the high prices were designed to keep too many customers from switching from the regular public telephone network to private lines, but that market conditions today no longer justified continuation of the special pricing. The commission said it expected the local phone companies to refrain from requesting such special prices in the future. While it was examining the challenges to the special pricing scheme, the commission said it found that local phone companies in some cases had charged more than allowed under the commission's guidelines Therefore, the companies must refund those charges, which could amount to as much as $ 75 million, the commission said. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said the amount of the refunds will not be known until the local phone companies file detailed reports with the commission. The companies have 40 days to make their filings. The companies found not to be in compliance with the commission's pricing guidelines from Oct. 1, 1985, to Dec. 31, 1986, were: <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraksa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>.

 Fighting broke out in the affluent western sectors of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> again today, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said leftist guerrillas briefly overran the home of an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officer. The rebels also burned a mansion just blocks away from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador's official residence, but no injuries were reported to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employees, according to the American officials. It was not immediately clear if the fighting signaled the resumption of a major guerrilla offensive on the capital that began Nov. 11 and appeared to have ended when the rebels withdrew on Nov. 22. The rebels said on their clandestine radio today they had attacked the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> with mortars. But officers on the scene said none had fallen in the compound, which also houses the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Reporters saw at least six dead soldiers in one neighborhood and one dead guerrilla in another. Residents of the zone, in the capital's western sector, said they heard several loud explosions near the fortified complex between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. Rebels fired rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles at the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in the western suburb of <LOCATION> Merliot </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Rigoberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, director of the academy, said the attack was repelled. He said his troops suffered no casualties but that a few guerrillas appeared to have been wounded. Fighting continued to be heavy after daylight on the edge of the affluent <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION> neighborhood, which reaches to the slopes of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> volcano, a guerrilla stronghold. <PERSON> Wilfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, soundman of a crew of the Spanish language network <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION>, was wounded in the back in the fighting in upper Escalon. Fighting was heavy at times before dawn along the tree-lined streets of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benito </LOCATION>, a wealthy residential district where <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> has his official residence. Guerrillas burned a mansion just blocks from <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s house. It was not immediately known whether <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was home at the time. Some of the homes attacked belonged to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy employees, but all the Americans were reported safe, White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> later told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the rebels were `` shooting their way into and invading certain private homes. They briefly overran the home of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officer but were driven out by the Salvadoran armed forces.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> lives in the same neighborhood, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also cited unconfirmed reports that the rebels also invaded the Japanese embassy in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. He offered no further details. `` It is our belief that all <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> personnel and their families are safe but several are in their homes in this area of heavy fighting,'' he said. Guerrillas and soldiers of the U.S.-supported, rightist government also exchanged fire in <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>, south of the <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, where three light tanks were positioned across the street from a movie theater. Helicopters and O-2 spotter aircraft fired machine guns and rockets at suspected guerrilla positions west and south of the capital for several hours before dawn. Reporters saw at least six dead soldiers and a burned light tank on the edge of <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION>, and one dead guerrilla near <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>. Rebels last week assaulted <PERSON> Escalon </PERSON> and briefly took over the blocks surrounding the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> Sheraton Hotel. That attack marked the conclusion of what may have only been the first phase of a massive rebel offensive launched Nov. 11, the largest in the 10-year-old civil war that has killed an estimated 71,000 people.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, the Romanian gymnast whose unprecedented perfect scores at the 1976 Olympics made sports history, has fled to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and asked for temporary settlement, the state-run media said today. The report, by the <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency, said <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, who retired from gymnastics in 1984, applied for a temporary settlement permit, valid for three days at the police station in <LOCATION> Szeged </LOCATION>, 15 miles from the Romanian border. An earlier <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> report, which quoted Hungarian radio, had said <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> applied for asylum after crossing into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> by car before dawn Tuesday together with six other Romanians, who were not identified. She reportedly told Hungarian border guards that her escape had been organized `` in advance under the guidance of a Romanian man,'' the news agency said without elaboration. The earlier report quoted her as saying she had left behind a `` neatly furnished flat, a car and financial security for the sake of freedom.'' <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> was quoted as saying she had been denied permission to work abroad as a coach or even travel, in spite of numerous offers and invitations. She has been planning a coaching and refereeing career. An employee of the local radio station in the southern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Szeged </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> checked into the Royal Hotel there, spent the night and left this morning. The radio station employee spoke on condition of anonymity. An estimated 25,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarians complaining of discrimination, have fled to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in the past two years seeking refuge from chronic hardships under the regime of President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, 27, an ethnic Romanian, astounded the world as a petite, solemn 14-year-old, turning in a series of perfect 10 scores and winning three gold medals at the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> games. Her former coach, ethnic Hungarian <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON>, defected with his wife in March 1981 while on a tour of 15 American cities with the Romanian gymnastics team. He became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen last spring and coaches American gymnasts. `` I'm happy finally she made the step which would lead to a free life, what she fully deserves,'' <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Clarens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> `` is still a big personality in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, -LRB- and -RRB- she has nothing against the <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> population, but just like me she was chased out of the country by the Romanian authorities,'' <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> said he would `` warmly and honestly'' urge her to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It is still the country with the greatest respect for <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> and at the same time a country still with the greatest opportunity,'' he said. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> is listed by the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> as the first gymnast to receive a perfect score in a major international tourney. During her carreer, she collected 21 gold medals, 12 of them for Olympic and world titles.

<TEXT>
 Despite a long history of supporting Lebanese Christians, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say they wo n't intervene this time to defend Christian Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from Syrian attack. The bitter experience of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> from 1982-85 is largely responsible for the change in policy. However, the Israelis have issued new warnings to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> about making moves they say would endanger <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security and its northern border. For example, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Avihu </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin-Nun </PERSON>, the Israeli air force chief, said on armed forces radio Wednesday that surprise flights by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> warplanes over <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> territory where Israelis routinely patrol could lead to clashes. Referring to reports that a Syrian MiG-23 had buzzed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s presidential palace in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bin-Nun </PERSON> said: `` There is no doubt that entrances like this to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> can result in a clash, even unwanted. He hinted at diplomatic contacts to prevent greater tensions and said, `` We are trying to make sure that the Lebanese do not get us involved in a war that we do n't intend, and we hope we will succeed in that.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has insisted it needs a clear view from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s airspace to protect its border from attacks by <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem guerrillas It also has used the skies to launch 15 air raids on guerrilla targets this year. Officials have said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not tolerate Syrian troops moving south of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Awali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> river </LOCATION>, about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border, or into areas <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> evacuated in June 1985 at the end of the three-year occupation. Those areas include the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The occupation produced a consensus that is strongly against renewed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> involvement. The war cost the lives of 650 Israeli soldiers, damaged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s image abroad and caused deep political splits at home. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in June 1982 following clashes in which Israeli troops went to the defense of Christian militiamen being attacked by Syrian forces. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> threw its military backing and political support to <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, a Christian militia chief. But <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> was assassinated in 1982, reportedly with Syrian involvement, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s hopes for a friendly Lebanese government were undone. The Christian militia's refusal to play a major role in driving out <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas also caused deep resentment in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s army Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, the chief of staff, said last week that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had no plans to intervene in the current standoff between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> troops unless its own security was threatened. `` As a matter of principle and policy, we do not involve ourselves in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, as long as there is no Syrian threat or other threat along our northern border,'' he said. One senior <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not support <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> just because he was a Christian leader. `` We are tired of backing losers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' the official said. However, there was lingering support among some Israelis for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s anti-Syria campaign, especially in the right-wing led by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytan </PERSON>, a former chief of staff and now a member of parliament, said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should support <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. He said Syrian gains in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> `` will bring increased pressure on us in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' where <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> still supports a 2,500-member Christian-led militia known as the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.

 Bomb squad officers at the airport today blew up a Colombia-bound suitcase thought to contain explosives, only to discover the bag contained nothing more dangerous than a video game, police said. `` It was n't an explosive device. It was a <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> game,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>. X-rays at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> had detected what appeared to be sticks of dynamite, wiring and a clock inside the suitcase, which was to have been loaded onto an <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet bound for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, police said. `` Our bomb squad acted on that information and we exploded it in the canister,'' said Officer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frio </PERSON>. There were no reports of threats against the flight, police said. On Monday, an Avianca jet exploded near <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, killing all 107 people aboard. Drug traffickers in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> have waged a campaign of bombings there, but investigators have raised doubts about whether terrorists caused the blast. `` This got more publicity because of the Avianca jet explosion,'' <PERSON> Frio </PERSON> said of today's incident.

 <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay $ 19.75 million in penalties and compensation for a 1988 spill of more than 400,000 gallons of crude oil that fouled a scenic waterway near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the mayor says. Mayor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Menesini </PERSON> said Tuesday the agreement is the largest oil spill settlement in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> history. `` It provides a clear warning that harm to our environment will not be tolerated,'' he said. The spill fouled a 15-mile stretch of the <LOCATION> Carquinez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> shoreline and a marsh next to <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s refinery. It killed at least 300 birds and animals. <PERSON> Menesini </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 11 million to restore damaged wetlands and an additional $ 4.7 million in civil penalties for violating federal rules in allowing the oil to bypass a collection dike and pour into the waterway 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The settlement also will pay for such things as environmental studies of the affected areas and restoration of the fishing industry. The oil company admitted that it illegally allowed storm water to drain from the top of a 12.5 million gallon oil storage tank, and that oil leaked through a flexible pipe in the middle of the tank and made its way into the waterway. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> had ignored a federal requirement to monitor the drainage system before making discharges, allong discharges to go directly into state waters. Additional settlement details were to be released at a news conference in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> this afternoon.

<TEXT>
 Regulations that ban panhandling in the subway system violate the constitutional rights of homeless people who may need to beg to survive, according to a lawsuit filed by advocates for the homeless. The class-action lawsuit brought Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> challenges `` Operation Enforcement,'' a recent drive by the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> to enforce existing rules, including the prohibition on panhandling. The lawsuit charged that the ban on begging singles out the homeless because it allows other people to solicit contributions for charitable, religious and political causes. `` The intended purpose is simply to roust the homeless and needy from the subways,'' the lawsuit said. The regulation violates the First and 14th Amendment rights of the homeless, it charged. `` To deny them this exercise of free speech is to deny them the means to survive, for they spend the money they ask for on the very necessities of life, that is, on food, shelter, clothing, transportation and medicine,'' the lawsuit said. The plaintiffs are two homeless men who panhandle in the subway system. The lawsuit, brought by the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless, was filed on behalf of all homeless people in the state. The defendants are the <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION> and two of its agencies, the <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't believe it's a constitutional right to panhandle, but it's an obvious issue for the courts to decide,'' said <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Davila </PERSON>. The lawsuit seeks a court order barring the <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION> from enforcing the ban on panhandling. A hearing is scheduled Friday before Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 In the year since <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last met with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president, the Soviet leader's world has turned topsy-turvy, with a legislature challenging him at home and demonstrators chasing Communist regimes from power in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side, the change is less striking: Simply the man at the top. As <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prepares for his first meeting as president with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the world overseas appears to be changing at a faster pace than at any time since World War II, when President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> began the practice of sitting down for a summit with the Soviet leader, at that time <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Since the most recent superpower summit on Dec. 7, 1988, when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has formed the first non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has scrapped its <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has opened the <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> has dumped its longtime Communist boss, and the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovakian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has surrendered its monopoly on power. Only <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, long a maverick in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, has remained cold to the thaw started by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> after he rose to power in March 1985. For years the Soviets complained about what they perceived as the tumult of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electoral process, with presidential balloting every four years and congressional races every two clouding the rare air of geopolitics. Now the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seems tranquil compared to the free-for-all in the Communist world. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, under pressure to respond to changes in the Soviet bloc, scheduled the meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> off the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> isle of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> this weekend. He has also begun planning for a military cutback. He would be hard put to keep pace with the revolution in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was embarrassed in elections last March, the most democratic legislature in 72 years of Soviet history is learning to stand up to the government and the party, and ethnic unrest has shaken the country from the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. On the international front, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials, like their predecessors, are complaining that Soviet surrogates <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> are exporting revolution to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Closer to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Soviet troops pulled out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> last February, but the Kremlin-backed government there remains in power. The president of the U.S.-backed Afghan Interim Government in exile, <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON>, on Monday said he wants <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to pressure <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to end support for the `` puppet government'' and reach a political accord with the resistance. In arms control, many hurdles have been cleared, but the superpowers have not finalized deals to cut nuclear, conventional and chemical weapons. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> last September in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> was removing two major obstacles to a proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -LRB- START -RRB- to reduce long-range superpower nuclear weapons by up to 50 percent. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the Soviets were withdrawing the precondition that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> abandon its Star Wars strategic defense initiative. He also said the Soviets were seeking a separate agreement to limit submarine-launched cruise missiles, rather than include them in START. But the Soviets have been pressing for talks to curb the might of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, and want to ban the submarine cruise missiles within that framework. Although changes have been more slow and orderly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they have occurred. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has replaced <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as president and after months of skepticism appears to have embraced <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s apparent uncertainty prompted Democrats, led by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, to label the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president as `` timid'' in responding to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s backers claim he has been playing a cool hand, alternating his public hesitation with careful preparation and brilliant masterstrokes. He was heavily criticized for not replying in kind to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s surprise announcement, before his last summit with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, that he was unilaterally withdrawing 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and cutting the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> by 500,000. Then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed last May that the two alliances agree within a year to make sharp cuts that would eliminate the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact numerical advantage. Now the alliances appear near an agreement under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would reduce its forces in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 30,000, and the Soviets by ten times that many. Before the Oct. 31 announcement that he would meet with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was criticized for not seeking a summit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, and the Soviets have not disagreed, that he first requested the meeting after he traveled to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> last July and met with reform leaders who urged him to consult face-to-face with the Soviet leader.

 Army experts safely defused a bomb a police inspector found under his car Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> said. The bomb contained one pound of a plastic explosive, a police spokesman said, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.

No group claimed responsibility for planting the bomb.

 Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> was released Wednesday from a hospital where he underwent hip replacement surgery earlier this month. He said he feels fine. `` If I do n't run out of parts, I'll probably be here the rest of my life,'' said <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, 80, referring to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where he has had several major reconstructive surgeries. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> has suffered from degenerative arthritis of his hips and knees since his early 60s. The Nov. 14 surgery replaced an artificial right hip he received in 1975. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> had had similar surgery on his left hip in June, and had previously had his left knee replaced. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>'s `` high level of activity'' wore on the original artifical hip, said his orthopedic surgeon, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hedley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> would receive therapy at his suburban <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> home and probably would be able to walk aided only by a cane by early next year. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>'s daughter would stay with him for a few weeks, <PERSON> Hedley </PERSON> said. `` I want him to get back to doing exactly what he wants to do,'' <PERSON> Hedley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hedley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>'s hips would n't need further replacement. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, who retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 following five terms, appeared relaxed in his wheelchair as he was questioned about world affairs and whether he thought his style of `` shooting from the hip'' was responsible for his medical troubles. `` When I shot from the hip, I fanned.

<HEAD>Health Department Considered Grinch That Stole Christmas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A decision to enforce an 11-year-old health ordinance on a charitable group's functions has members scrambling to provide a Christmas meal for thousands of hungry <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> residents. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> started requiring the <ORGANIZATION> Citywide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of Clubs to follow an ordinance that requires food served to the public to be prepared at a city-approved kitchen, just in time to cause problems for the group's annual Thanksgiving feast for the needy. The private, non-profit community service organization has relied heavily in the past on donations of home-prepared food _ turkey, hams, dressing, vegetables, desserts, relishes _ to pull off its annual Thanksgiving and Christmas feasts, club Director <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said Tuesday. Last week, because of the new enforcement, volunteers faced with a record 60,000 people for Thanksgiving ran out of food three or four times, and only the hasty barbecuing of 500 chickens saved the day, he said. `` Now you ca n't get through our main telephone lines because of all the needy people calling up to make reservations for our annual Christmas feast on Dec. 23,'' said <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>. `` And we're scared. We're afraid we're not going to be able to feed all these folks.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuchlewski </PERSON>, a health department official, was unable to explain why the group was n't required to meet the ordinance until this year. `` We appreciate all the work that the <ORGANIZATION> Citywide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> is doing in feeding all these people but, by the same token, we want to make sure the food is safe,'' said <PERSON> Zuchlewski </PERSON>. `` We're just trying to protect the public.'' Health department officials will gladly work with club members to make sure they know how to conduct their feast according to regulations, <PERSON> Zuchlewski </PERSON> said. `` There are all kinds of items that can be donated that will satisfy people on the street and satisfy the health code,'' <PERSON> Zuchlewski </PERSON> said. The department cited such things as canned vegetables or frozen turkeys. <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> is worried, but he hesitates to slam the health department. `` They gave us their reason and we understand. If people even put harmful things in trick or treat candy, we understand the potential problem of letting people bring prepared food,'' he said. `` But even though we understand, we're still left with the problem of feeding all those hungry people.'' In addition to feeding the hungry and needy, the club last year distributed 12,000 donated toys to children and registered more than 7,000 people for jobs and housing.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should seek `` mutual advantage'' from the dramatic changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and hinted that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would back improved Soviet trade opportunities at this weekend's superpower summit. At the same time, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the two days of talks between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are `` not an arms control summit.'' At a White House news conference on the day before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s departure for a shipboard summit off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said the continued flow of Soviet-made arms to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> government amounted to a `` Cold War relic. He stressed in a prepared statement and in reply to questions that U.S.-Soviet relations were on the upswing, and that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika, or restructuring, program to reform the Soviet economy was firm. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said it would be a mistake not to support the reform movement sweeping the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> even if there is a chance the pace may bring some temporary instability. `` The real question is not whether perestroika will succeed or fail,'' he said. `` The real question is this: Do you engage the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in a search for mutual advantage in this time of uncertainty. And our answer to that question is a resounding ` yes.''' Hardline Communist governments have been removed from power in recent weeks in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, in addition to the changes that moved through <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> earlier in the year. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has expressed fears that the changes within the Soviet bloc would be exploited by the West. But in a nationally televised speech last Wednesday night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered `` our assurance that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> welcomes reform, not as an adversary seeking advantage but as a people offering support.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> broadly hinted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would offer to support Soviet participation in the international group known as <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> _ the General Agrement on Tariffs and Trade _ that would make it easier for the Soviets to trade with other countries. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the issue definitely was on the president's summit agenda, but he did not want to pre-empt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s discussion with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. And he said the success or failure of the summit depended on no single issue. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> spoke as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration needs `` a more meaningful response'' to the new political climate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and urged the president to press for movement on trade and arms control at the summit. `` While I welcome the administration's offer to provide technical advice to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, I believe a more meaningful response is necessary,'' the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat told a news conference. He again called for a trial waiver of trade restrictions aimed at the Soviets under the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> used his pre-summit appearance before reporters to take a hard line on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and to rule out a deal in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would cut off its assistance to rebels in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s remarks about <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, where rebels recently renewed their offense against the government, and Soviet support for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> contrasted with an otherwise warm stance toward <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Soviet behavior in regional conflicts contrasts sharply with the pattern of its conduct in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The continuing pattern of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> arms shipments to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Third World clients is especially disturbing This pattern is a Cold War relic,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can promote perestroika and foster new thinking in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he can also stop `` throwing fuel on the fire'' in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> spoke as sources said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget squeeze may force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to confront a proposed armed forces cutback even as he reassures the allies he will not cut a military deal with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> behind their backs at the summit. On <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desk before his takeoff Thursday evening for the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> could be a recommendation from <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> to trim the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> by 275,000, or 12.9 percent from current levels, defense sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday night. The Army would be reduced by 135,000, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> by 100,000 and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> by 40,000 under a proposal from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed services chiefs, said the sources, who declined to be identified. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> will find the recommendation on his own desk when he flies home from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> early Thursday. The cuts would be carried out by 1994, and would involve the elimination of three army combat divisions, five and a fraction <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> fighter wings and about 60 naval vessels, the sources said. The fleet includes 562 vessels, and the idea would be to reduce to about 500 by 1994. If <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> accepts the recommendation, he would take it to the president before his departure for the summit. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, is pushing for even deeper cutbacks in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, the sources said. It was not clear whether the president would make a decision before his takeoff, and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined comment today on the matter. He said the president planned to spend most of the day in preparation for the summit, and would also discuss the summit at some length at a private dinner at the White House tonight for Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. The spokesman also said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had discussed the summit today by phone with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. They also discussed <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s new proposal for the reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the spokesman said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> on Wednesday said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration needs `` a more meaningful response'' to the new political climate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and urged the president to press for movement on trade and arms control at the summit. `` While I welcome the administration's offer to provide technical advice to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, I believe a more meaningful response is necessary,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told a news conference. He again called for a trial waiver of trade restrictions. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the `` American people are united in support of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he travels to this important meeting.'' And he added that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was right in his approach concerning possible discussion of arms control and military forces with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the summit off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. He expressed hope that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would reaffirm his commitment to a START treaty. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the administration should say clearly it will abide by the 1972 ABM treaty and `` abandon the view that it can reserve the right to unilaterally change the terms of a treaty limiting strategic defenses while seeking to conclude a binding agreement limiting strategic offenses.'' He said that `` concluding the current conventional negotiations under way in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> has assumed even greater importance in light of the changes taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' On trade, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should forget its offer to provide technical assistance to the Soviets. `` They've not requested that,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said `` But we should demonstrate our willingness to move toward a trade relationship based on market principles rather than political proscriptions,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. He reiterated his suggestion of last May that the administration should grant a trial waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which restricts trade with the Soviets to bring pressure on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for freer emigration policies. He said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s loosening of emigration curbs over the last few years justifies such a move. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to propose talks aimed at reaching a commercial trade agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He said in response to a question that such an agreement would not result in any quick upturn in imports from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The reason is very simple. There's very little produced in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that Americans would be interested in buying.

<HEAD>Interior Reportedly Ready to OK California Water Leases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> tentatively has decided to renew long-term water leases for irrigation in central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration remains divided on how to ease environmental concerns over the leases, administration sources said Wednesday. Objections from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> prompted <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> to delay announcement of the lease renewal plan on Tuesday, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A spokesman for the secretary disputed suggestions that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had blocked the decision, but acknowledged that the lease announcement was postponed. `` We wanted a unified administration position on this issue. If delaying the process a few days will help us reach that, it's that much the better,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>. He added, `` The decision is the secretary's to make.'' The renewal of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> water contracts, one of the thorniest water issues in the West, has developed into a major environmental test for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, with critics of the 40-year leases arguing that they should not be renewed at current water supply levels and for such a lengthy duration. According to administration sources, <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> earlier this week decided to renew the leases without first requiring completion of a formal environmental review. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>'s plan called for initiating an environmental assessment as part of the lease renewal plan, the sources said. But the proposal ran into trouble at the White House after <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Deland </PERSON>, chairman of the president's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION>, objected to the `` fine print'' of the proposed environmental review, according to the administration sources. <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> reportedly maintained that the environmental review suggested by <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> was meaningless because it would have had no effect on key provisions of the renewed water contracts, such as length of the lease or volume of water being supplied. <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> raised the objections with White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the sources said. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, denied that <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>'s proposal had been blocked by the White House. He said that while there were some concerns from the Council on Environmental Quality, the delay resulted from legal questions and technical wording raised by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. Environmentalists have filed a lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, arguing federal environmental laws require a formal assessment of the environmental impact of such long-term leases before they are renewed. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> also has argued no leases should be renewed until such an assessment is made and the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year sided with the EPA. The leases, which are expected to expire over the next year, provide more than 1.5 million acre-feet of federal water annually to irrigation districts across a broad expanse of central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> decided in April to proceed with renewing one of the leases providing water to the Orange Cove Irrigation District in eastern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> for 40 years without an environmental study. That brought sharp criticism from environmentalists. Legislation was introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that, if enacted, would block any further lease renewals unless an environmental impact study is performed. A federal judge in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> warned that any lease renewals will be subject to his eventual decision on the lawsuit brought by the environmentalists. The long-term irrigation leases are expiring at a time when <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is struggling to develop new water distribution and water quality protection plans. Disputes over water has pitted Northern Californians against those in the southern part of the state, and urban users against farmers. There has been concern about how the diversions will affect water quality, soil conditions and fish and wildlife habitat if such long-term diversions are allowed to continue. Critics also argue that the large water diversions have kept farmers from conserving water when growing urban centers are worried about future water shortages.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Parks Legislation for Colorado, Iowa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed legislation Wednesday clearing the way for expansion of the Rocky Mountain National Park in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and helping create an interpretive center for three national historic trails in Council Bluffs, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Part of the 515 acres being added to the park are a migratory route to winter ranges for deer and elk. Some of the land had been eyed for a housing development. Other portions now lie within the <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, which will cede the land to the Rocky Mountain National Park. The government expects the 515 acres to be donated for the 265,000-acre park 65 miles north of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, which draws 3 million visitors annually. A separate measure signed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> authorizes federal help of up to $ 8.4 million to develop the interpretive center in Council Bluffs near the <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mormon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pioneer </PERSON> trails. The legislation requires that every $ 2 in federal funds be matched with $ 1 in non-federal funds. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had opposed federal participation in building the center, which will not be located on a historic site. No funds have yet been appropriated to carry out the plans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed both bills without comment.

 <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, suspended chairman of the Navajo tribe, pleaded innocent to corruption charges today in tribal court. The 60-year-old leader of the nation's biggest Indian tribe was charged Oct. 11 by special prosecutors hired by the tribe with 107 offenses, including conspiracy, bribery, fraud, extortion and election-law violations. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who was suspended by the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> three months ago, also is the target of a federal grand jury investigation and a defendant in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit filed by the 225,000-member tribe. The lawsuit and the bulk of the criminal charges focus on the tribe's purchase of an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> ranch for $ 7.2 million more than the sellers had paid for it hours earlier. The tribe's prosecutors also filed charges against the suspended vice chairman, <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, and <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> has pleaded innocent to 15 election-law violations; the younger <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was to be arraigned later today <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who three years ago was inaugurated for a fourth term in a lavish ceremony attended by dignitaries in rented limousines, is pleading poverty and has asked for a court-appointed defense attorney. On Monday, Tribal Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON> rejected the request, saying <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> is `` far better off financially than all but a handful of Navajos,'' but gave <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> until today to provide more evidence that he's indigent. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> appeared at his arraignment today without an attorney and did not press his request. `` I'm still in the process of trying to retain counsel. ... I can find one,'' he told <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON> as the arraignment began. Prosecutors said <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has a net worth of more than $ 400,000 in addition to the $ 55,000 annual salary he still draws while on paid administrative leave. Allegations emerged in testimony before a special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee in January that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> personally profited from the tribe's 1987 purchase of the 491,000-acre Big Boquillas Ranch. The tribe paid <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON>, two longtime friends of <ORGANIZATION> MacDonald </ORGANIZATION>, $ 33.4 million for the ranch soon after they had purchased it for $ 26.2 million. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> received $ 50,000 plus vacation trips and lease of a BMW automobile. In August, the tribe filed a $ 24 million lawsuit in state court against <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and others over the ranch purchase. Meanwhile, a federal grand jury investigation has been under way for at least a year. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has strongly denied the allegations. At a news conference the day after the complaint was filed, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> promised to `` stand up and fight.'' He reiterated his contention that the federal government wanted to oust him and other strong Indian leaders so it could have easier access to minerals and other natural resources on reservations. Attempts to reach <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> on Tuesday were unsuccessful. His Flagstaff residence has an unlisted telephone. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was acquitted of federal fraud and income tax evasion charges in 1977, six years after he began his first term as chairman. He lost a re-election bid to <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Zah </PERSON> in 1982 but regained the office with a 750-vote victory over <PERSON> Zah </PERSON> four years later. His latest problems began after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs' hearings on his financial dealings. Several witnesses, including his son, testified that bribes and kickbacks were an accepted way of doing business on the Navajo Reservation. A month later, he was placed on administrative leave by the 88-member <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Sporadic violence followed, culminating in a July clash between police and about 300 club-wielding <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> supporters in <LOCATION> Window </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. Tribal police shot and killed two of <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s supporters, and nine other people were injured. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>, the interim tribal chairman, blamed <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> for the violence, saying he could have prevented it had he wanted. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, however, blamed the police, saying they overreacted to a peaceful demonstration by his supporters.

 Hundreds of students packed their belongings and left campus Wednesday after authorities closed <ORGANIZATION> Copperbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to end violent protests, the second school to close in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> this month. Students were ordered to leave the university in <LOCATION> Kitwe </LOCATION>, 225 miles north of <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, by nightfall, campus officials said. Students were expected to return after the Christmas vacation, a campus spokesman said. The decision to shut down the campus ahead of the vacation came after several days of unrest in which students stoned cars and buildings and assaulted teaching staff to protest low food allowances, said the spokesman. On Monday, rampaging students dragged vice chancellor <PERSON> Mubanga </PERSON> <PERSON> Kashoki </PERSON> from his office and forced him to stand on the roof of his car and address protesters gathered in a parking lot. There were no reports of injuries. The students demanded that their food allowances of about $ 166 a term be more than doubled to match allowances received by privately sponsored students. <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s main university campus in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION> was closed Nov. 23 after 3,000 state-sponsored students looted food stores and boycotted class.

<HEAD>Study Finds Scarcity of Programs to Fully Use Older Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American employers value the dependability and loyalty of older workers but most do little to recruit or retain these employees or to help them adapt to new technologies, according to a private report released Wednesday. The study found `` a real gap between the positive attitudes being expressed ... and the actual mechanisms and practices that are now in place to utilize older workers,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Meer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Daniel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankelovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a research company. The report, commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>, was based on telephone interviews with executives at 400 businesses and on `` focus group'' discussions among employees age 50 and older. Seventy-nine percent of the surveyed executives reported their companies were `` finding ways to leverage the experience of older workers,'' but other research data `` did not support this success in tapping older workers' skills,'' the study said. Many older workers, meanwhile, see themselves as an untapped resource and feel frustrated about the scarcity of programs to help them contribute more on the job, the report said. `` When discussing their work situation, ... older employees seem fearful,'' it said. `` They believe they are vulnerable, even disposable.'' Skills-training programs for older workers had been adopted by just three in 10 companies surveyed, the same proportion as in a similar 1985 study, and one-fourth of businesses had a formal commitment to fully use older workers, down from one-third in 1985, it found. `` One of the most disturbing findings of this study is the reported decline in senior management's formal commitment to utilizing older workers,'' the report said. Unless more is done to help older workers adapt, `` non-technologically oriented older workers could find themselves shut out of rewarding, well-paying positions,'' the report said. <PERSON> Meer </PERSON> predicted that growing labor shortages in the 1990s will force businesses to adopt new ways to integrate older workers into the workforce. `` This will require new approaches to the way work is organized, the types of jobs that are available, the ability to have part-time work that is knowledge-based and not just service-oriented,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Deets </PERSON> said the report indicates businesses are shedding stereotypes of older people as being afraid of change, unreliable and unable to learn new tasks, but many companies `` have not translated that into action by hiring and retraining older workers.'' <PERSON> Deets </PERSON> said the message for older workers was: `` You have to take the initiative to seek training and maintain needed skills. An older worker ca n't wait for an employer to make the first move.'' The study found that businesses give older workers high ratings on characteristics such as attendance, punctuality, reliability, commitment to quality and loyalty. For example, 89 percent of employers rated their older workers as excellent or very good in commitment to quality. Older employees got their lowest marks on feeling comfortable with new technologies, such as computers, with just 22 percent of the businesses rating their older workers as excellent or very good in that category. Executives at the largest companies were prone to give older workers less credit for their work habits and to be more critical of their ability to adapt to technology, the report said. The report said that in addition to questions about older workers' adaptability to new technology, businesses also show growing concern about the cost to employ older workers, particularly to provide them with health insurance. It also found increasing use of early retirement programs to reduce costs.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> raised the possibility Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact might enter into a second set of negotiations to slash conventional arms and troops further in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said at the end of a two-day meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> that no decision had been made to go beyond the current bargaining in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to reduce non-nuclear forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` But,'' he said, `` I certainly would not rule out the possibility'' that after an agreement was reached in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, the alliance `` would then decide upon further steps to accelerate and expand upon'' the pact. He said he hoped that `` we will be able to persuade the Soviets to ultimately withdraw all of their forces from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The current bargaining between the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations and the seven of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact is designed to reduce the East's enormous superiority in tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Both sides would be brought down to equal levels under proposals on the table. As part of those talks, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has suggested the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> pare their forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to 275,000 on each side. The plan would require the Soviets to pull out 300,000 troops and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 30,000. An agreement on conventional armed forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is expected in the second half of next year. During meetings with other defense ministers, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> sought to dispel fears the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would unilaterally pull its troops out of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> because of budget pressures and reduced East-West tensions. Reports of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> plans to clip military spending in coming years has prompted concern about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' ties to its European allies. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said that over time, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could possibly `` contemplate ... additional reductions'' in deployments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But, he said, such cuts would take place `` only in the context of the alliance, only based upon consultation with our allies and only based upon similar kinds of developments with respect to the East.'' `` There has been no slackening in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' he insisted. `` There will be no slackening in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. There will be no unilateral reductions in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deployments with respect to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' share of total defense spending by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations amounted to 64 percent. `` I do not expect that to change in significant ways,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said defense ministers at the meeting found <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s remarks `` realistic and reassuring.'' He said said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> made clear that `` no significant changes'' in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were under consideration before an accord at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Any major reductions beyond that, he said, would be done in consultation with the allies. German Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sees future troop cuts to mean that Europeans `` must take on more responsibility'' for the West's common defense. In a final statement, the defense ministers welcomed the rapid pace of political and economic reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but urged caution. `` A time of rapid political change presents the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> with new opportunities, although the resulting uncertainty also carries potential risks,'' the statement said. `` Our defense requirements must continue to be assessed against the realities of <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> military capabilities,'' it said. They noted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had taken initial steps to fulfill last year's promises of unilateral arms reductions, but said <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces were still larger and better-equipped than in the West. `` There has unquestionably been a change in the nature of the threat which confronts us,'' said <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, `` but not yet a significant change in the military capability of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact.'' The ministers said they would follow a step-by-step approach to changes in the East and promised not to make any unilateral arms cuts that could hurt chances for an accord on conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations will gather Monday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to hear about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s weekend summit with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The alliance's defense ministers meet twice year in their role as the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which is outside <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s joint military structure, does not attend <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, which has no armed forces, has observer status.

We extend to them our good wishes and offer them our constructive cooperation,'' said the 45-year-old former airline pilot, who won his own Parliament seat overwhelmingly for a third time. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> won more <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> seats in last week's elections than any other party, but was far short of a majority. <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to remain in office as caretaker prime minister. The resignation cleared the way for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION> to form the next government for the world's most populous democracy. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been out of office only once before since independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, for 29 months after losing the 1977 elections. National Front leaders predicted Wednesday they would choose the next prime minister, but differences arose among the five parties. A meeting was delayed until Thursday, then Friday, while legislators from the alliance tried to persuade its main leader, <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, to take the job. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> has repeatedly said he doesk not want it. `` There will be trouble in the party if V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is not elected prime minister,'' said <PERSON> Jaipal </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, largest of the five parties in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is a former <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> minister and ally who has become his most prominent political foe. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and its allies picked up enough pledges of support from smaller parties Wednesday form a majority in the 543-seat <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>, the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> where the power lies. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s party is gambling that the coalition will be hamstrung by internal squabbling, paving the way for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to regain power. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> legislators met Wednesday night and unanimously re-elected <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> as parliamentary leader, putting him in the position of becoming prime minister again if the opposition should fail and President <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to form a government. Asked whether he was prepared to lead the opposition, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said with a smile: `` Absolutely. We will be a very good watchdog.'' Later, the party's parliamentary board decided not to claim the right to form the next government, state TV reported. Throughout the campaign, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> portrayed the election as a choice between the stability his government and potential chaos under the opposition. Many feuds have been reported within the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> since it was formed in August 1988. Leaders of the various parties set aside their differences after elections were called in mid-October, but squabbling resumed while the votes were counted. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a 58-year-old former defense and finance minister, is the best-known of its leaders, but has said he just wants to be president of the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION>. Another prominent Janata Dal member, <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shekhar </PERSON>, said he was ready to be prime minister, but some colleagues do n't support him. The taciturn 62-year-old former socialist engineered the opposition victory in 1977. `` As of now, there is only one candidate,'' <PERSON> Reddy </PERSON> said. `` Despite persuasion, V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is not a candidate and despite disuassion <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shekhar </PERSON> remains one.'' With 512 seats decided, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had 190 and its smaller allies 17 for a total of 207. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> had 139 and its allies 137, a total of 276. It takes 263 seats for a majority in the <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>, which will convene with 525 seats. Elections for the remaining 18 seats were postponed because of the deaths of candidates and other reasons. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> entered <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and became prime minister in 1984 after the assassination of his mother, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. continuing the political dynasty started by his grandfather, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>. As one of his last acts, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> began the process of dropping criminal charges against <PERSON> Simranjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a fomer police officer charged with conspiracy in the murder, who was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. He did not say why the charges were being dropped.

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has cited the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for unsafe work conditions surrounding a fatal B-52 fire, alleging workers were n't given proper tools and cigarette butts were found near where the plane was being fueled. One worker was killed and 11 were injured in the July blaze at <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. The notice Tuesday from the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> includes 16 `` willful'' violations and two `` serious'' ones. No fines were imposed because the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is a federal agency. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> did not pinpoint the the fire's cause but found several hazards were present. Among the violations cited were cigarette butts found within a 50-foot safety zone. However, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> did not allege that workers were smoking. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> also said an `` integral tank tool kit'' was not available for testing one of the plane's fuel tanks. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>, the agency's area director, refused to elaborate today on how the lack of proper tools related to the accident. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has until Dec. 11 to correct some violations but must correct others as soon as Monday. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement today that the <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> citations parallel the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s own findings and that `` corrective actions are already in progress.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> blamed the accident on an improperly constructed, unapproved fuel tank vent plug mistakenly left on a fuel tank after the tank was tested for leaks. That caused the tank to burst when filled, according to the military. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> also charged that the fire guard had left the refueling area and was not present to detect leaking fuel and give a warning, and that supervisors did n't brief the refueling crew, discuss escape routes or designate one person to direct refueling.

 <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>, a confidant of <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> convicted in a multimillion-dollar fertilizer swindle in the 1960s, has been indicted with five other people on charges of stealing trade secrets. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>, 64, was freed on $ 10,000 bail Tuesday with three other defendants. The six were charged in an indictment unsealed Tuesday with engaging in organized criminal activity. They were accused of plotting to steal and duplicate trade secrets owned by <PERSON> Loadcraft </PERSON>, a manufacturer of container cargo trailers. `` They were going to go into business against <PERSON> Loadcraft </PERSON>,'' said District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>. `` They were basically ready to go when we stopped it in March 1988.'' It took more than a year to indict them because `` it takes a mountain of records to put these things together,'' <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. If convicted, the six each face two to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 10,000, he said. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said one of those indicted, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzan </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, had been plant manager at <LOCATION> Loadcraft </LOCATION> and stole trade secrets and manufacturing plans before he left there.

He was convicted in 1963 of mail fraud and conspiracy in a swindle involving nonexistent fertilizer tanks backed by federal agriculture loans. He began a 15-year prison term in 1965 and was paroled in 1971. In 1979, his parole was revoked and he was sent back to prison for mail fraud and conspiracy to conceal assets. He was released in 1983. His parole expired this year. After his 1983 release, he said, `` I'm just one drink away from being a drunk and just one deal away from being back in prison.''

<HEAD>Analysts See Weakening in Economy's Moderate Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew moderately from July through September, the government said Wednesday, but analysts said it has since weakened sharply, threatening to derail an unprecedented peacetime expansion. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, grew at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2.5 percent rate originally reported last month. Earlier this year, economists had widely forecast only sluggish growth in the quarter, but the revision means the third quarter topped the 2.5 percent second quarter rate. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We always like to see increase in growth. And this report is relatively good news in that sense.'' However, private analysts predicted with near unanimity a sharply weaker performance in the final three months of 1989 and the first quarter of next year. A few expect the nation to topple into a recession, ending the expansion, which enters its eighth year in December. `` We should enjoy these -LRB- third quarter -RRB- numbers because the chances are we're not going to see their like anytime soon,'' said economist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Most economists attribute the current sluggishness to a year-long anti-inflation campaign by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which pushed interest rates up through this spring. Since then, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has nudged rates lower, but the economy wo n't reflect the full benefit of rate cuts _ and any further declines in the next few months _ until later next year. `` The reason the economy will skirt a recession, but not fall into one, is interest rates are coming down substantially,'' said economist <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. He predicted a further decline in rates next month. In other economic news, an administration source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to name Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to a vacancy on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> board. Economists said the appointment was likely to give the administration, which has sought a looser monetary policy, a greater voice in the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s decisions. Although the GNP revision Wednesday was in line with economists' expectations, it still caused a negative ripple in financial markets because traders interpreted it as a sign the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will feel less pressure to lower rates immediately Most of the revision was attributed to a better-than-anticipated trade performance. The September trade deficit, which hit a five-year low, was unavailable when the advance estimate was made. Exports climbed at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of no change, while imports grew only 9.5 percent, compared with a 15.1 percent jump in the initial report. Consumer spending was also better than first thought, rising at a brisk annual rate of 6.2 percent _ the strongest since the first quarter of 1988 _ compared with a preliminary estimate of 5.8 percent. Inflation, as measured by a price index tied to the GNP, improved dramatically in the third quarter, climbing at an annual rate of 2.9 percent after a 5.0 percent jump in the April-June quarter. Those figures were unchanged from the advance estimate. Analysts generally expect that the third-quarter surge in consumer spending will not be repeated, attributing much of the rise to auto purchases spurred by dealer discounts and financing incentives. They also are pessimistic about trade, believing that the strength in the dollar will stall further improvement in the deficit. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said after-tax corporate profits were off a sharp 7.2 percent in the third quarter, matching the decline in the second quarter, which was the worst performance in three years. It was the third consecutive quarter that profits have dropped. The department attributed much of the decline to losses from Hurricane Hugo.

 A judge declared a mistrial today after a jury deadlocked on racketeering charges against three avowed revolutionaries already cleared of plotting to overthrow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The ruling by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> came on the jury's 21st day of deliberations in the year-long trial. The jury for three days had said it did not think it would be able to reach agreement on the racketeering and conspiracy charges, which involved 15 successful or attempted bombings of courthouses, banks, corporate offices and military recruiting and reserve centers. One of the bombings, at a courthouse in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in 1976, cost one man his lower leg. Some other bombs failed to explode. It was not immediately clear if a second trial would be held on the racketeering charges. The jury delivered a partial verdict Monday acquitting the three of sedition, or trying to overthrow the government, a charge rarely used since the Civil War.

On trial were <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gros </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>.

 States should be allowed to ban abortions for most unmarried girls unless their parents are notified before such operations are performed, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was told today. But challengers to parental notification laws in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> countered that the measures unfairly impinged on a girl's right to abortion, as guaranteed by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in its 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision Groups on both sides of the abortion issue looked to the court this term to clarify where it stood on <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. But an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case that promised to be the major barometer of the court's intent was settled out of court last week. The cases argued before the court today dealt, not with the broad issue of whether abortion should be legal, but whether parents of minors should be notified if their daughters seek one. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, considered a key vote in both notification cases, expressed skepticism about the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law's requirement that both biological parents of a girl be notified before an abortion is performed `` The statute just does n't provide for any exceptions, even when it's not in the child's best interest,'' she told <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Chief Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON>. `` How do you defend the state's best interest?'' <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON> said biological parents are presumed to have `` rights and responsibilities'' in the upbringing of their children that the state should defend. But <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Benshoof </PERSON>, representing challengers to the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law, said the state gave minor girls inadequate protection against unfit parents. She said the law requires notification of a parent who may be `` a mental patient, a fugitive, who beats the family regularly.'' In some cases, there are fathers who have been been absent from the family for years and the daughter seeking an abortion would have to notify him even if he were `` a complete stranger,'' Ms. <PERSON> Benshoof </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law requires notification of one parent. `` States are entitled to enact laws to aid parents,'' <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Eppler </PERSON> argued. Ms. <PERSON> Eppler </PERSON> urged the justices to reinstate a law she said preserves a minor's right to abortion while aiding parental involvement. But <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sogg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> lawyer representing those who successfully challenged the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law in lower courts, contended, `` <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> really has singled out ... abortion ... for the notification requirement.'' She said young girls seeking medical help for drug abuse or a contagious disease face no such parental-notification requirement. At issue in both cases are state laws requiring doctors to notify parents before performin abortions sought by unmarried girls under 18 who are still supported by a parent. The lawyers in both cases were asked numerous questions by the justices during a two-hour-long presentation. As an alternative to parental notification, the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law allows a young girl to try to persuade a judge that she is mature enough to make the decision on her own, or that telling her parents is not in her best interests. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law says a young girl must prove her maturity by `` clear and convincing evidence.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> asked whether that standard makes it too difficult for young girls seeking a judge's approval to get an abortion without parental notification. `` What about the risk of erroneous deprivation'' of a minor's right to abortion, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> asked Ms. <PERSON> Eppler </PERSON> But Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> noted that both <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> contend that no so-called judicial bypass alternative to parental notificiation is required. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law `` represents no undue burden,'' Ms. <PERSON> Eppler </PERSON> said, adding that the state has a pressing interest in assuring the involvement of parents `` when their daughter faces perhaps the most serious dilemma of her young life.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Sogg </PERSON> argued, `` not all parents are loving,'' and referred to `` too many statistics about how unloving parents can be.'' She told the court many young girls who desire abortions have a `` fear of parental retaliation or abuse.'' About half the states have laws requiring parental consent, but most of the laws have been invalidated after court challenges. Nationwide, about 40 percent of the nearly 1 million teen-agers who become pregnant each year seek abortions. Of the 1.5 million legal abortions performed annually since 1973, about 12 percent _ 180,000 each year _ have been for minors. The court touched off a political firestorm in July by voting 5-4 to give states greater power to regulate abortions. Four justices appeared ready to go even further and overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> refused. But she has been critical of the 1973 ruling and has not discounted the chance she someday would vote to reverse it. Neither <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> is asking the court to reverse <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has. Although it did not seek to participate in today's arguments, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urged the court to use the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> case to rule that women have no constitutional right to abortion. `` We continue to believe that <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> was wrongly decided and should be overruled,'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said in a friend-of-the-court brief. The disputed <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law was passed by the state legislature in 1985 but never took effect, due to a successful legal challenge by an <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> abortion clinic and one of its doctors, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaujean </PERSON>. The law would have required any doctor asked to perform an abortion on an unmarried girl under 18 to contact one of the girl's parents at least 24 hours before the operation A young girl could seek to bypass parental notification by seeking a state judge's permission to have the abortion. A federal judge struck down the law, and that ruling was upheld by the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law requires such young girls to notify both biological parents at least 48 hours before obtaining an abortion. The 1981 law makes doctors criminally liable for violations. After enforcement of the law was blocked, a judicial-bypass provision took effect. It allows a girl to avoid notifying her parents by convincing a judge she is `` mature and capable of giving informed consent'' or that not notifying her parents would be in her best interests. The notification law with the judicial-bypass option was in effect in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> for five years before it was struck down by a federal judge. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed that ruling last year and said the law is constitutional. The appeals court, however, blocked enforcement of the law pending <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> action. The cases are <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, 88-805, and <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, 88-1125 and 88-1309.

<HEAD>GAO Says Commission Overestimated Savings from Base Closings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal commission overestimated the annual savings from closing or realigning 15 military bases, but the eventual amount still will be considerable, a congressional agency said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said that based on revised and updated data it found that the annual savings from shutting down or scaling back the 15 bases amounted to $ 453.4 million _ about $ 170 million less the $ 622.9 million the commission estimated. `` But still a substantial annual savings,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The congressionally established Commission on Base Realignment and Closure recommended in January closing a total of 86 military bases and scaling back five more, a proposal accepted by then-Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. Despite overwhelming support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the plan, a number of lawmakers questioned the commission's methodology and complained that its findings were based on faulty data. Members asked this past summer that the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, review the commission's work on 15 bases slated for closure or realignment, including the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chanute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, in its report, said the commission overestimated the savings at the 15 bases because of `` data errors, inaccurate estimates and the exclusion of certain relevant costs.'' Specifically, at the Jefferson Proving Ground in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the commission did not calculate the cost of cleaning up munitions at the facility. The panel estimated annual savings of $ 6.6 million at the base and six years to recover the closure costs. But the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that it could take anywhere from 38 to more than 200 years to recover the expense of closing Jefferson Proving Ground. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also estimated savings at $ 6.3 million annually. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> closely monitor the closing and realignment of the bases, which are to be completed by Sept. 30, 1995. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> provided oral comments on a draft of the report which generally agreed with the agency's findings, although it estimated that the annual savings from the 15 bases will be about $ 522 million

 Police used tear gas and water cannon to force back hundreds of young demonstrators Wednesday who attacked the towering monument to <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, state media reported. The demonstration, called by the radical Movement for an <ORGANIZATION> Alternative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, targeted the statue that dominates a square in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>, an industrial city of 220,000 people built outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> in the 1950s to be a model workers' community. According to state TV and the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency, the demonstrators used metal bars and hacksaws to begin dismantling barriers surrounding the monument to the founder of the Soviet state before police intervened. Demonstrators shouted chants calling for dismantling the monument and the removal of the estimated 40,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The protesters finally dispersed after pleas for moderation from Solidarity parliament Deputy <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, who promised to propose dismantling of the monument to parliament Thursday, state TV said. The 33-foot-tall statue long has been a hated symbol of Soviet domination in the city, a Solidarity stronghold which until 1977 was denied the right to have its own <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Last week, demonstrators splashed paint on the statue and tried to set it ablaze. In 1979, worker activists dynamited the statue, blowing off one of its legs. It was quickly repaired by communist officials and several people were imprisoned in the attack. The attempt to dismantle <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s statue follows the officially sanctioned dismantling of another hated symbol, a monument in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Dzerzhinsky </PERSON>, the founder of the Soviet secret police, on Nov. 17. City officials agreed to the dismantling of the statue and the renaming of <LOCATION> Dzerzhinski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> where it stood, saying the statue's removal was needed in connection with subway construction work The Solidarity-led government has sought to maintain friendly relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including a trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last week by Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. He has condemned outbreaks of anti-Soviet vandalism. But his government has stressed that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is a sovereign country and must no longer be dominated by its larger neighbor.

 The Postal Service, currently testing a self-adhesive stamp, is about to try out a plastic stamp and a hologram. The self-adhesive 25-cent stamps, showing an eagle and selling for slightly more than face value, are being tested in 15 cities across the country. Early sales have been reported good. The new plastic stamp, also self-adhesive, was unveiled this week at World Stamp Expo in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and will be test-marketed in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. This stamp was designed to be sold in bank automatic cash machines, and it is made of plastic to make it easier for the machines to dispense. A 25-cent stamp, the plastic model features a stylized American flag, with a dozen stamps sold together on a backing sheet the size of a dollar bill. Testing will begin early in 1990. The hologram, a specialized design in which the image changes color when viewed from different angles, goes on sale Sunday. It is on a stamped envelopes and features a picture of the planned space station. The stamped envelope will cost 30 cents, including the 25-cents postage.

 Two memories of Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, one from historian <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON>, one from columnist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, are recounted in the December issue of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> magazine: <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> was having lunch with the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Republican on Labor Day 1952 when <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> got a phone call from the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> returned to the table looking troubled. The caller, he said, wanted him to go to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and speak on behalf of Sen. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, who was being challenged by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee. `` That's hard to do,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> complained. `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> -LRB- JFK's father -RRB- has always been on my side, and he contributed $ 5,000 to my own re-election campaign If I go to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> will lose to <ORGANIZATION> Cabot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION>, no doubt about it.'' Lunch resumed, but 15 minutes later <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> got up and went to the phone.

At the library <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> flipped straight to the `` M'' section and pulled out several drawers of cards on books by and about <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, and threw them down on the director's desk. `` This is a goddamned outrage!'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> roared. `` The good children of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> should n't be exposed to this crap.

Instead of arguing the merits of <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> or pleading for academic freedom, the director explained why the books could not be summarily torched _ they were state property. Taken aback by this invocation of so basic a conservative value, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> relented, but insisted that the volumes be locked up with the library's collection of pornography. <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> says he checked back a few weeks later.

 A school district must supply a sign-language interpreter for deaf parents at school-sponsored conferences involving the education of their children, a federal judge ruled Wednesday. `` School-sponsored activities that are designed for parental involvement and are focused on the student's academic or disciplinary progress ... must be made available to the hearing-impaired,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goettel </PERSON> wrote. The case is the first of its kind in the country, said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Charmatz </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deaf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, which brought the case. He said most school districts willingly supply sign language interpreters. The parents, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, have two children who can hear normally in the <ORGANIZATION> Ramapo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Charmatz </PERSON> said. One is a fourth-grader and one a high school senior. The district is in <LOCATION> Rockland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, north and across the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Since the early 1980s, the parents have sought an interpreter so they could participate in parent-teacher evenings and other activities involving their children. The <ORGANIZATION> Rothschilds </ORGANIZATION> have retained sign-language interpreters at their own expense, paying an estimated $ 2,000 through the 1988-89 school year, according to the decision. The couple maintained that they are denied equal opportunity to participate in school programs and to consult with school district personnel concerning their children. They sought relief under the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which says any organization receiving federal aid can not discriminate against the handicapped. The school district claimed that the parents do not qualify under the act because they are not students. <PERSON> Goettel </PERSON> said that the regulations of the act define reasonable access for a deaf person as including a sign-language interpreter. `` Without the provision of a sign-language interpreter, the plaintiffs are de facto barred from the participation in the school district's programs for parents,'' <PERSON> Goettel </PERSON> wrote. `` This is not a case where the relief sought by the plaintiffs would be cumulative or duplicative of services they are already receiving.'' <PERSON> Goettel </PERSON> added, however, that the district's obligation `` is limited to school-initiated conferences incident to the academic and-or disciplinary aspects of their child's education. To the extent that the plaintiffs wish to voluntarily participate in any of the plethora of extracurricular activities that their children may be involved in, we think they, like other parents, must do so at their own expense.'' Attorneys for the school district did not immediately return phone calls. In <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a deaf <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law student won a court order Monday forcing the school to provide her with classroom notes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brotman </PERSON> ordered the university's law school not to hold two classes attended by <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> unless she receives notes within 24 hours of each class Ms. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> sued under the same law as the <ORGANIZATION> Rothschilds </ORGANIZATION>.

A Hinds County grand jury that meets Dec. 11 is expected to explore whether to bring new charges. `` The decision of the district attorney as to whether to try <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> again should be based on whether he thinks the evidence available to him at this time is sufficient to obtain a conviction,'' <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> wrote in the new ruling. <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> also wrote that evidence of jury tampering would not be admissible in any new murder trial. The Sovereignty Commission, created by the 1956 Legislature, infiltrated and harassed civil rights groups. It went out of existence in 1973 when its funding was cut off. The 1977 Legislature sealed the agency's records until 2027. <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> ruled July 27 the records should be open to the public, but allowed them to remain sealed pending appeals to the 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. Published reports have been that the commission screened potential jurors before <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>'s second trial in April 1964. <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> was shot to death outside his <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> home June 12, 1963. <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>'s rifle was found nearby and one of his fingerprints was on the rifle sight, but <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> testified the gun had been stolen from him. <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> said he might later reconsider <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>' request for the records. `` The district attorney argues that if he attempts to retry <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> will argue that such retrial would be barred by his constitutional right to a speedy trial,'' <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> wrote. While prosecutors plan to respond that proof of jury tampering would make it possible to retry the case, the judge wrote, `` this argument is premature and may be renewed if the district attorney decides to retry <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> and if <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> raises the speedy trial issue.''

<TEXT>
 A posse of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents has rounded up two adult <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> elephants allegedly stolen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> more than five years ago by a man who insists he repossessed the animals for non-payment and animal abuse. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> said Tuesday the agents seized the elephants Monday at a farm where circus animals are trained and boarded. Civil action involving the elephants is pending in federal court here, <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Arlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON>, 60, was arrested in October by <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputies and is fighting extradition to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. He is free on $ 20,000 bond. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Santimauro </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> said the elephants were n't seized until this week because authorities did n't know where they were <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> says he repossessed the elephants in 1984 after a dispute with two men who bought them from him in 1981. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> claimed the buyers mistreated the animals and fell behind on their payments. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> was arrested after he was tracked down by one of the men, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, who has said he has spent thousands of dollars searching for <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> and the elephants around the country. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> sold the elephants, <PERSON> Tory </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duchess </PERSON>, to <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, who owned a now-closed exotic-animal ranch in <LOCATION> Tehachapi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in 1981 for $ 80,000. A judge in <LOCATION> Monmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, in 1984 ordered <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> to return the 7-foot-tall elephants. Instead, <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> fled with them in a truck and hid them. The Drakes denied abusing the animals. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> has said he raised the animals, now in their late 20s, from infancy. He told a newspaper in 1988 that he left his <LOCATION> Fordland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, farm and his career preparing animals for circus and television appearances to care for the elephants. He also said he had n't seen his four children or met his grandson since he took off with the animals. <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> declined to say where the elephants were taken after the roundup, but said they are somewhere in eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> faces charges of theft in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. If convicted he would face up to five years in prison and a $ 100,000 fine.

 Christian militias that have opposed Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said Wednesday they would join him in fighting the troops, tanks and artillery <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is massing around <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian enclave <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, the new <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> president backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, dismissed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as army commander Tuesday and ordered him to leave his command post in a bunker beneath the presidential palace in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> claims <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s election by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last week was unconstitutional, says he wo n't accept a new peace plan until the Syrian `` occupation army'' leaves the country, and has refused to turn over the shell-battered palace. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest Christian militia, the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> forces, said it would fight beside the 20,000 Christian troops who followed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> through a six-month artillery war with the Syrians earlier this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the main right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> political force and also a foe of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, pledged to confront any attempt to storm the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north and east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Thirty-three members of the French parliament met with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. In a show of support that contradicted the official French government stand, the legislators joined thousands of young men who have formed a human shield around the palace. One of the lawmakers, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosson </PERSON>, said he was `` amazed at the flood of masses'' at the palace and declared: `` This is like the people's movement in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> asking for democracy.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> supports <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, who is trying to strengthen his central government and reunite the fractured military as part of an effort to end the 14-year-old sectarian civil war, in which more than 150,000 people have been killed. Christians have dominated the government, army and judiciary since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> became independent of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. Residents of <LOCATION> Chtoura </LOCATION>, an east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> market town on the <LOCATION> Damascus-Beirut </LOCATION> road, said Wednesday afternoon that scores of 122mm and 133mm Syrian artillery pieces were moving toward <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the central mountains above <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, followed by dozens of trucks filled with ammunition. They said hundreds of empty trucks were heading back toward <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, apparently after unloading soldiers and equipment. Earlier, the residents reported seeing at least 15,000 soldiers in 800 trucks roll into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> between Monday night and midday Tuesday, along with 90 tanks, 120 field guns, mine-clearing tanks, armored personnel carriers and ammunition trucks. Both <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> and Moslem military sources said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had Soviet-designed T-55 tanks arrayed on the line that separates Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from the capital's Christian sector. Larger T-62 tanks formed an `` arch of fire'' pointed at <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops in <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Gharb </LOCATION>, a mountaintop town that commands the main routes to <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> A Christian source said: `` They are in combat formation. It seems they are only waiting for the orders. It's a significant buildup, the kind of measures that precede a major battle.'' <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, commander of the Lebanese Forces militia, said: `` I ordered our forces last night to be ready to link up with their comrades of the Lebanese army in defense of the liberated areas,'' a reference to the 30 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> free of Syrian troops. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 soldiers regularly stationed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> issued in 1976, the year after the civil war began. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> arranged a cease-fire Sept. 22 in the battle between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and the Syrians, in which nearly 1,000 civilians were killed. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s soldiers drove the 6,000 Lebanese Forces militiamen from east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in a power struggle that culminated in a 4-day confrontation in February that killed 82 people and wounded 200. A statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said: `` This is the hour for mobilizing all potential without exception to face any attempt to storm the Christian area. We shall be in the forward defense lines.'' The Phalange and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> parted company on the the peace plan worked out by Lebanese legislators worked out in October at <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The Phalange supports the plan, but <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected it because it did not include a fixed timetable for Syrian withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Information Minister <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON>, a Phalangist, said in an appeal to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> on Tuesday: `` We all ask you to prove that you really love <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. ... Allow peace to prevail. You must rest and let the nation rest.'' A Christian military source said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces had planted thousands of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines in valleys that separate the Christian enclave from Syrian positions.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday talked by telephone with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> about <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s plans for German reunification as Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> outlined a four-point <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stand on the divided country White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwaer </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> had discussed the chancellor's plan and that they also had talked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s upcoming summit meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The spokesman said he had no details of the conversation. `` We note that Chancellor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is responding to the deepest aspirations of his people,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` This is a goal that we and the Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have long held in terms of German unity.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters at a pre-summit news conference that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position on German reunification `` should essentially embrace four principles.'' They are: _ The people of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should decide for themselves whether they want unity and what form it should take _ A reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should be a member of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> _ Any steps toward reunification should be `` peaceful, gradual and part of a step-by-step process'' to preserve European stability _ Any change of borders in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should be made according to the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords, which specify that frontiers can be changed only peacefully `` We really should n't endorse or exclude any particular vision of unity,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Unity can mean a lot of things. It can mean a single federal state. It can mean a confederation. Or it could mean something else.'' There have been suggestions that a reunited <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> might be neutral, with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> withdrawing from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opposes such a West German withdrawal from the Western community. `` There should be no trade of neutralism for unity and there should be no dilution of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s liberal democratic character,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> had not mentioned changing borders. Some right-wing political forces in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have called for reclaiming traditional German areas that have been in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since World War II. `` I think we should reiterate our support for the principles of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act, recognizing the inviolability of frontiers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and allowing for the possibility of change in those borders only through peaceful means,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was asked whether he thought a Europe-wide conference should be held to consider the German question. He said he thought the 35 nations _ involving <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ that signed the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords `` all have a very firm and definite interest in what happens with respect to the question of unification.'' But he said the focus should be first on what is meant by unification because the word `` means different things to different people.''

<HEAD>Two Masked Palestinians Shot to Death by Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Israeli soldiers shot and killed two masked Palestinians who were throwing stones at Israeli cars Wednesday, the army said. The men reportedly were stoning the cars on the main highway between <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. They started to run after soldiers arrived and ordered them to halt, the army said. `` The soldiers then opened fire according to standing regulations, and as a result two were killed,'' said an army spokesman, who can not be identified under military regulations. Their deaths raised to 619 the number of Palestinians killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or civilians during the nearly 2-year-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule in the occupied territories. At least 151 others have been slain by fellow Arabs as suspected collaborators. Forty-two Israelis have also been killed. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 16 Arabs were wounded from army gunfire as Palestinians in the occupied territories observed a general strike to mark the anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> vote to partition <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The Palestinians, ranging in age from 8 to 28, were shot with live and plastic bullets during stone-throwing clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Most of the wounded were shot in the legs. The army said it had no reports of any Arabs wounded but that two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were slightly injured by stones thrown at them. The army also said it sealed two houses in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> belonging to families of men accused of helping kill Palestinians suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, soldiers found two metal pipes with explosives and detonators near the city of <LOCATION> Tulkarm </LOCATION>. One bomb was blown up by soldiers and the other fell apart, according to Israeli reports. The strike, called by leaders of the Palestinian uprising, marked the 42nd anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s vote to partition <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> into separate Jewish and <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION>, which led to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s creation less than a year later. Workers in the occupied territories stayed home, merchants closed their shops and public transportation ground to a halt, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. General strikes have been a frequent protest tactic in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which were captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. Twenty-five people lived in the nine-room house that was sealed in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In nearby Beach Camp, 17 people lived in the five-room house sealed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Each had a family member suspected of helping kill an accused collaborator with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Israeli military authorities have destroyed 244 Palestinian homes and sealed 116 others since the start of the uprising, army figures show. International human rights groups have condemned the moves as harsh and drastic measures that have failed as a deterrent.

She collects bells, and her home in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, is brimming with them. `` I do have a lot of bells,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Long </PERSON>. That's an understatement. By her own estimate, about 20,000 bells fill every nook and cranny in her home, which she calls <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION>. A 2,200-pound bell is displayed in the front yard, and other bells adorn her front and back porches, gazebo and driveway. `` It's the largest collection in the world,'' said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Natrona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, another collector and former editor of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, the publication that connects 2,600 members of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said bell collecting is contagious, and her children and grandchildren have caught the bug `` Touch one or two and first thing you know, you're a bell-a-holic,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Long </PERSON> caught the bug from her father and inherited his collection, although she had started her own many years before he died. She finds bells at auctions, in shops and trades with other collectors. Among her most unusual pieces are a set shaped like a man and a woman. The man nods no, and the woman nods yes. She has three bells, dating between 1828 and 1862, from the locks of the old <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> canal. An 1869 `` Wedding of the Rails'' bell commemorates the opening of the transcontinental railroad. Other bells resemble figures of famous people including <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Poe </PERSON> and Friar Tuck. She ca n't resist collecting. `` After all, a bell is the only thing in the house that thanks you for dusting it _ it rings,'' she said.

 Hundreds of museums, galleries and other institutions plan to observe `` A Day Without Art'' on Friday to mourn artists who have died of AIDS and for the art that might have been. Plans include darkening galleries and removing or covering artwork. Some organizations will mount special exhibitions or hold seminars or memorial services. Others will close for the day. `` Our aims are to honor and recognize friends and colleagues who have died or are dying, and to seek greater support and understanding from an ill-informed and sometimes hostile public,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolowski </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Grey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> and a member of Visual AIDS, a group of art professionals who organized the event to coincide with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s second `` AIDS Awareness Day.''

<TEXT>
 An East German economic recovery like the one that transformed war-ravaged <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> into one of the world's richest nations, hangs on the fate of a crudely minted, featherweight coin <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s aluminum Ostmark is non-convertible abroad and quickly losing its value at home due to a dearth of goods and a free fall on illegal exchange markets. West German financial experts consider currency reform to be a crucial first step toward a convertible Ostmark and economic recovery. But even the most committed reformers in the communist state have so far resisted the idea of forcing a nation nurtured on socialist promises of security to endure the draconian transition to a currency of real value. East Germans have $ 84 billion stashed in savings banks _ the equivalent of more than $ 5,000 for every man, woman and child in the nation. That poses a massive threat of inflation, as well testifying to a chronic lack of anything desireable to buy in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Price controls have to be removed or drastically reduced to bring the cost of goods in line with the cost of their production, economists on both sides agree. But prices would skyrocket if state controls were lifted while so much cash is at the ready. Western economists therefore recommend a currency reform, or replacement of the long-disdained Ostmarks with a new currency that people will respect. `` Whatever else needs to be done hinges on a currency reform,'' said <PERSON> Liane </PERSON> <PERSON> Launhardt </PERSON>, a senior economist with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commerzbank </ORGANIZATION> `` We feel it is pivotal for introducing market economic elements and getting important projects off the ground.'' She described the move as `` bitter potion that no one in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> wants to swallow,'' but like other Western economists said widespread unrest will be unleashed if runaway inflation results from attempted half-measures. `` How soon a currency reform could be implemented depends on how long it takes to accept economic reform as the way out of the current crisis,'' said <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest financial institution. <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> predicts East Germans could enjoy the same living standards as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in five to 10 years if they quickly come to grips with the nationwide sacrifices needed in the interim. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s post-war recovery was achieved in large part because of the 1948 currency reform that replaced the inflated Reichmarks with Deutschmarks at a rate of 10-1. The measure immediately infused confidence in the currency and put an end to the `` cigarette economy,'' where food and other necessities were valued in American tobacco. But it devastated the personal wealth of most Germans in the occupied Western sectors and inflicted harsh sacrifice on those without property and other tangible assets. The East German government is not prepared to wipe out private cash reserves deliberately, said <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Koeckerbauer </PERSON>. `` We do n't consider it necessary,'' he said. `` We are trying to encourage citizens to have confidence in the financial system, and such measures would run counter to that aim.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new finance minister, <PERSON> Uta </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickel </PERSON>, has likewise brushed off Western suggestions that subsidies be drastically reduced in the transition to market-related pricing. `` Changes to the practice of subsidies must be considered with all caution,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nickel </PERSON> told the labor newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Tribuene </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everyone is now criticizing the subsidies, as if they had n't been enjoying them for years.'' The views being expressed by East German and West German economists on the need for currency reform reflect the sensitive political situation complicating recovery. Communists have held power since the East German state was founded in the Soviet-occupied sector of defeated <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1949, and to suddenly advocate measures undertaken by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> four decades ago would be tantamount to an admission of political errors. The Communists face challenges to their continued rule both from unrecognized opposition movements and from the smaller political parties they have been aligned with for 40 years. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> needs a new and more-secure political system in place before it can seriously tackle economic measures of the magnitude of a currency reform and convertibility, according to <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Milzer </PERSON> of the West Berlin-based <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. But time is running against restraint, especially since East Germans have been allowed to travel freely to the West. Untold thousands have smuggled out their excess currency and traded it as low as 20 Ostmarks to one West German mark, flooding the illegal market to the point that free traders will no longer buy the East German currency at any price. <PERSON> Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Berliner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign exchange division, said estimates run as high as $ 1.6 billion on the amount of East German currency traded illegally in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> by tourists wanting funds for weekend shopping sprees. Ms. Nickel, the finance minister, has proposed a value of 4.4 Ostmarks per West German mark as an internal conversion rate to provide tourists with travel money. But no realistic rate has been mentioned in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> as a target for eventual convertibility to hard currencies. Internal reforms, like replacement of the Ostmark, are viewed as necessary to even start aiming for conversion, said <ORGANIZATION> Berliner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> Noting that initial West German offers of assistance have been rebuffed as interference, <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said a convertible currency is `` clearly a long way off.''

Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> received a standing ovation from the audience of about 1,000 as she took the stage to read her husband's words.

<HEAD>Rare Birds Fly Straight Into Windmill Blades</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 State officials want to know why majestic birds of prey capable of spotting a mouse from aircraft altitudes fly straight into the whirling blades of windmills at the <LOCATION> Altamont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> energy farm. Since 1986, a total of 99 eagles, falcons, hawks and owls have been killed at the farm's thousands of 40-foot windmills, considered one of the most environmentally safe ways to generate electricity. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is spending $ 120,000 to find out why. `` These birds may have the sharpest eyes, but they do n't necessarily have the biggest brains,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Orloff </PERSON>, a senior wildlife biologist with <ORGANIZATION> Biosystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Tiburon </LOCATION> company hired to do the study `` At this point we really do n't know why they're doing this,'' <PERSON> Orloff </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Altamont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, with 6,700 windmills sprouting like steel daisies over 80 square miles along Interstate 580 near <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, is the world's largest and most productive wind farm. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> produces more than 90 percent of the world's wind-generated electricity, and <LOCATION> Altamont </LOCATION> is the largest of the state's six wind farms Together, they produce enough power for a city the size of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. The pass is also a traditional migratory path where birds of prey hunt for food during their flight down the state's <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to winter in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> study, administered by <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Costa </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Solano </LOCATION> counties, is being conducted during the spring, fall and winter seasons at <LOCATION> Altamont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>. Five Biosystems Analysis biologists are counting birds and studying their behavior every day at the farm. They speculate the birds, despite their sharp vision, may be mistaking the windmills for trees. They may also be concentrating so intently on their prey that they do n't see the whirling blades, <PERSON> Orloff </PERSON> said. Researchers are experimenting with ways to deter the birds, possibly using noise or painting the windmills a bright color. Local ordinances, however, aimed at preventing eyesores prevent windmill operators from painting the windmills. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> DeAngelis </PERSON>, manager of the state energy commission's research and development office, said he doubts that any of those ideas will work `` If this is a problem, it's going to remain a problem,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, which operates nearly half the windmills at <LOCATION> Altamont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, also has hired a biologist to study ways of stopping the deaths, said <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a business development associate for the company. `` It's really a shame that this happens, and we'd like to do what we can to make sure it does n't happen at all,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The company has built roosts on power line poles to keep the birds from electrocuting themselves by sitting on lines and has developed a manual to help field workers handle accidents. It also contributes money to a shelter in <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> for injured birds of prey.

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday to investigate Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s decision leading to dismissal of the Iran-Contra case against a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief. There is a `` strong possibility'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s action regarding <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> stemmed in part from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s desire `` to cover up its involvement in the Iran-Contra affair,'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, said in a statement. A week ago, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> filed an affidavit blocking disclosure of classified information relating to the location of three <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> facilities in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and details of three agency programs in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was acting on behalf of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> threw out the criminal charges aganst <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> on Friday, saying the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s ex-station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> needed to use the classified information in order to get a fair trial. The office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is appealing. In a session with reporters Wednesday, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he expected the 4th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> will allow the trial to go forward by overturning <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to allow substitutions for the classified information. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> refused to discuss the information when asked if it revealed <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> involvement in covert aid to Nicaraguan rebels, as claimed by <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. `` These are troublesome areas,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said, noting that when he headed the criminal division of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration he revoked an order giving the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> power to determine `` who could be prosecuted within their organization.'' `` I found that to be unthinkable. That's a decision that has to be made by prosecutors in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, answering questions after a luncheon speech Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, was asked if the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> were trying to protect <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. He replied, `` That's absolutely without merit. <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>, in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should ... investigate whether the attorney general acted properly in refusing to release information required to allow the trial to go forward.'' It went to the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committees and judiciary committees. `` This case gives the appearance of a conflict of interest,'' the letter stated. `` Neither the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, represented by the attorney general, nor the intelligence community had an interest in seeing this case go to trial,'' said the letter. `` The intelligence community may have been much more interested in protecting <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> and its relationship with him than in protecting vital national security secrets,'' the letter added. The case against <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was being handled by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office and `` the attorney general had no stake in the prosecution,'' said <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>. The attorney general `` appears simply to have followed the dictates of the intelligence agencies in refusing to disclose the information,'' the letter stated. In filing the unprecedented affidavit, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> invoked a provision of the Classified Information Procedures Act. The law requires the attorney general to report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in all cases where the prosecution can not proceed because the government bars disclosure of classified information. It was sent to Sens. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> is chairman and <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> is vice chairman.

<HEAD>Possible Serial Killings Spread Fear Among Prostitutes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of prostitutes on the city's streets has dropped dramatically in the past few weeks as the number of unsolved killings of young women has grown to 13, police say Seven bodies of young women have been found in the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> area in the past two months. The most recent victim was <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, 29, whose body was found Monday by a hunter. On Thanksgiving Day, the body of <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotts </PERSON>, also 29, was discovered in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Genesee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> gorge. Of the 13 unsolved slayings in the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> area in the past two years, police have identified all but three of the victims as prostitutes. Another prostitute has been missing since early November. <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> police say that solving the killings is their top priority, but no arrests have been made and they have refused to comment on whether they have any suspects. `` I think the murders will continue'' until the killer or killers are found, Deputy Chief <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickard </PERSON> said this week. He said there may be at least three killers responsible for the deaths. Many of the city's prostitutes fear they are being stalked by a serial killer. `` I'm scared to death,'' said <PERSON> Debra </PERSON>, a 24-year-old prostitute, as she paced nervously on a corner north of downtown recently. `` If it was n't for my drug habit I would n't be here anyway.'' <PERSON> Rickard </PERSON> said the number of prostitutes working the city's streets has declined dramatically since mid-November <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> said she tries to stay off the street as much as possible but sometimes `` you ca n't help it.'' Sister <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Conheady </PERSON>, a nun who has worked for years with prostitutes, said she has been to the funerals of some of the victims and talked with their friends. `` The next day, I've seen them back on the street,'' she said. Sister <PERSON> Conheady </PERSON> said public attention to the string of deaths was slow in coming because prostitutes are considered `` the most disposable of people.'' `` Why has it taken so many deaths to arouse our attention?'' she said. `` People think they can take out violence on them because they're not worth anything.'' On weekend nights, nearly as many police cars as prostitutes cruise Lyell Avenue, a strip of liquor stores, pizza joints and neon-lit bars just a few blocks from the <LOCATION> Genesee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gorge </LOCATION>. Eight of the victims have been found along the gorge within a few miles of one another. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> said the officers are all over the neighborhood, telling the prostitutes to stay off the streets. <PERSON> Yvette </PERSON>, 20, who did not want her last name used, said police follow prostitutes on their tricks. It makes her feel safer, she said. She said she has started carrying a knife. `` If someone tries to do something to me, I'll hurt them.'' At least four of the victims were strangled or choked, one was shot, two were beaten to death and one was hit by a car while fleeing an attacker. Police have not determined the cause of death of the five other victims. <PERSON> Rickard </PERSON> said solving crimes involving prostitutes is complicated because many of them are transitory. They come to <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> and work for a while, then leave with few clues after they are arrested or get into trouble, he said.

<TEXT>
 In the latest disclosure of alleged corruption in the top Communist ranks, newspapers Wednesday said that the former premier of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> turned a park into a private estate. The Communist leadership that took over last month has launched a campaign to expose abuses by former party officials, who could face prosecution. The aim is to improve the embattled party's image and restore its credibility. The official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON>, the former premier, lived `` surrounded by Western luxury'' on an estate containing several houses, fruit plantations and an indoor pool. He employed servants, including three gardeners, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON>, who was fired from the Politburo, resigned as premier on Nov. 7. The trade union newspaper <PERSON> Tribuene </PERSON> said the estate was located within a protected wildlife area on which <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON> built roads to carry his family and guests in <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> sedans `` when he did n't use a helicopter.'' The report said the estate contained more than 10 large refrigerators filled with food imported from the West, along with hundreds of bottles of the `` finest imported wine.'' <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON> left the estate after he lost his posts, <PERSON> Neues </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschland </PERSON> said, `` taking his most beloved furniture and other things with a truck.'' <PERSON> Tribuene </PERSON> said the house looked `` like it had been left in panic.'' Neither newspaper gave <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON>'s whereabouts. The party commission investigating corruption allegations said Wednesday it will turn over its findings to judicial officials. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said the commission recommended that the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> expel former non-voting Politburo member <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>. The report did not elaborate. The agency also said three officials expelled from the party in the 1950s had been rehabilitated, and that the expulsions of other former leaders were being reviewed. Also on Wednesday, the Communist-dominated trade union federation expelled former chief <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>. He was removed from the ruling Politburo this month for allegedly abusing his powers. The lavish lifestyles of top party officials have been a major source of discontent in a country where the average citizen has to wait 10 years or more for a car. Since taking over from ousted hard-line leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on Oct. 18, <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> has begun a program of sweeping reforms that includes promises of free elections and abolition of the Communists' 40-year monopoly of power. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> himself has moved from the exclusive residential compound of <LOCATION> Wandlitz </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, to a modest house in the city. The wooded, walled-in compound has been home to high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members. <PERSON> Tribuene </PERSON> said several former Politburo members and two current ones still live in <LOCATION> Wandlitz </LOCATION>, but that it would be turned into a rehabilitation center. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> is among those still living in the compound. <PERSON> Neues </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschland </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had ordered that a special shop in <LOCATION> Wandlitz </LOCATION> be emptied of rare Western-made consumer goods, such as video recorders. The Communist party has blamed <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and former economy chief <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economic crisis and has begun a disciplinary investigation of them. <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> already has been kicked out of the party.

<HEAD>Peres Praises Poland for Offer to Help Move Convent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Israeli Vice Premier <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> praised the Polish government on Wednesday for offering to help move a Roman Catholic convent located on the edge of the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said the government had offered land and financial support to build a new convent for the Carmelite nuns living in an abandoned theater used by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> as a storehouse during World War II. `` I appreciate the position taken by the Polish government,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. `` I was told the Polish government offered land and financial support and they expect the Catholic church to do the rest.'' The presence of the convent at the camp where up to 2.5 million Jews were murdered by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> is considered deeply offensive to Jews and severely strained Jewish-Catholic relations. Tension mounted earlier this year when the Roman Catholic church failed to honor a 1987 agreement to move the convent. Under pressure from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, Primate <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> in September pledged to move the convent. `` I do not see why this Carmelite monastery should hang like a cloud on our relations,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> visited the former concentration camp Wednesday on the final day of a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during which <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> said it would restore full diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> early next year. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON> on Monday informed <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s decision to restore relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> broken off 22 years ago. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> also met with Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and said he had invited the union leader to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, `` We should tighten our cooperation. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is pursuing reforms. In these reforms your participation is indispensable.'' A major aim of <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' visit was to improve economic cooperation. Polish trade with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will amount to $ 40 million this year, compared with $ 22.3 million last year. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also evoked the common history of the two peoples who existed together for centuries in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` Let us remember this was a country of two peoples. The war destroyed the Jewish people and to this day we feel the shortage,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had the largest Jewish population in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> until the Holocaust claimed 3 million of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Jews, with nearly all the rest emigrating after World War II. There has been a steady warming in relations between the two countries in recent years with senior <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and Polish officials, cultural figures and private groups exchanging visits. Except for <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, all <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations severed diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> following the 1967 Middle East War.

 Customs agents detected what they thought was a bomb in a suitcase headed for a Colombian airliner Wednesday and a bomb squad blew it up, but analysis of the debris revealed the luggage contained a video game. `` It was n't an explosive device. It was a <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> game,'' police Lt. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> said after experts examined the smashed remains. Customs officials will reimburse the owners of the destroyed suitcase, police said. Drug traffickers have waged a campaign of bombings and assassinations in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in retaliation for stepped up efforts to curtail their business and concern was heightened with Monday's crash of an <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane All 107 people aboard the plane were killed when it exploded this week near <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and initial reports, later dismissed by investigators, blamed the crash on terrorists. `` This got more publicity because of the Avianca jet explosion,'' police Officer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frio </PERSON> said after Wednesday's scare. Customs agents X-raying luggage checked in early Wednesday at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> spotted what appeared to be sticks of dynamite, wiring and a clock inside a large, heavy suitcase destined for an Avianca flight to <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The plane had not yet arrived. A police bomb squad put the suitcase and an explosive charge inside a protective canister and set off the charge to blow up the luggage and detonate any explosive it might contain. `` What they saw was what they believed to be an explosive device. Our bomb squad acted on that information and we exploded it in the canister,'' said Frio. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> spokeswoman for Avianca, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s national airline, said security had been tightened since Monday's crash. `` There is no confirmation on what caused the downing of that jet,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Cecelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Battista </PERSON> said. `` Security has always been tight but it is even tighter now.''

<TEXT>
 The Communist-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday swiftly ended the party's 40-year monopoly on power in a frantic effort to satisfy the demands of the growing pro-democracy movement. A member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> said the first free elections in four decades could be held within a year. Voting with the somber, mechanical gestures born of decades of rubberstamp approval of Communist measures, the 309 deputies unanimously scrapped Article 4 of the constitution, which mandated the leading role of the Communist Party. They also deleted a clause that bases all education on Marxism-Leninism. `` The revolution is proceeding much quicker than we expected,'' said <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON>, spokesman for the Civic Forum opposition, minutes after the vote was broadcast live on national television. The changes were among historic concessions the opposition won from the Communist government on Tuesday when Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> also promised to form a new government, including non-Communists, by Sunday. They followed 11 straight days of huge anti-government demonstrations, which culminated in a two-hour strike on Monday in which millions of workers participated. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> went on national TV and said he had asked Civic Forum for its suggestions on who to include in the new government. He also said he would negotiate a reassessment of the 1968 <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> invasion that crushed reforms. Civic Forum proposed that the new Defense Minister be a civilian Communist, and the Interior Minister, who controls the police, be a civilian non-Communist, <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> said. Parliament also eliminated the Communists' leading position in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization embracing all political parties and social groups allowed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Four deputies opposed the measure and 16 abstained. Shortly after the historic votes, state TV showed Slovak actor <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Knazko </PERSON> announcing word of the changes to a packed National Theater in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>. The entire audience, which included prominent dissident <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, rose to its feet in thunderous, minute-long applause. Parliament also planned to consider creating a constitutional court and a commission to investigate allegations of police brutality in a crackdown on protesters Nov. 17. The removal of the requirement that Marxism-Leninism be the guiding principle of education was a prime demand of students who staged the Nov. 17 protest and have led the pro-democracy movement since. In parliamentary debate, broadcast live on TV for the first time, deputies openly admitted past party failures and said the Communists must work hard to win the people's confidence. `` We have betrayed the trust of the electorate, and whatever laws we pass today will not change this,'' said <PERSON> Blanka </PERSON> <PERSON> Hykova </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, until recently a docile ally of the Communists. <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Blazej </PERSON>, dean of a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> training academy, said: `` We have misunderstood the leading role of the party and its position. We must regain this trust.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaclavik </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, sounded a cautionary note: `` I am aware that neither the army nor the party have the best position now. We should be aware that retreats and compromises are necessary, but there are limits.'' <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Indra </PERSON>, who said Tuesday he was quitting as <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> president, delivered a formal speech of resignation to the 350-member chamber. He described the resignation as `` a logical step in the context of the present developments.'' <PERSON> Indra </PERSON> was said to be among party leaders who requested the Soviet-led invasion of August 1968 that crushed the `` Prague Spring'' of reform instituted by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief. <PERSON> Bretislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Nedbalek </PERSON>, secretary of a preparatory committee, said <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had been re-established after an absence of 41 years. At the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> prayed that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> would use its Christian traditions in building its `` new future.'' About 5,000 people attended a Communist-sponsored rally Wednesday at <LOCATION> Ostrava </LOCATION>, an industrial city near the Polish border, including supporters of the opposition group Civic Forum. <PERSON> Senek </PERSON> <PERSON> Milota </PERSON>, a local party leader, told the rally, `` We do n't want to eat soup from a charity kitchen,'' an apparent reference to the party giving up power Civic Forum backers jeered loudly, but no trouble was reported. <PERSON> Vasil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> of the party's ruling Politburo said Wednesday that free elections could be held within a year, now that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to relinquish its monopoly on power. <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON>, the first member of the new leadership to face the international press, was asked a news conference when Czechoslovaks would have a chance to vote freely, and replied: `` First, it is necessary to change the laws. Most probably it will take place within a year. We do n't want the monopoly of one party to continue.'' Party chief <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said Tuesday the Communists were ready to give up their exclusive control. Despite repeated questions, <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> did not say specifically the party would hand over control if it lost free elections, but he stressed several times: `` We're a different party now, and you all should get used to it.'' He conceded the new party leadership chosen last week is under pressure from its own 1.7 million members as well as the opposition, and said a special party congress tentatively set for Jan. 26 might have to be held sooner. At a closed meeting of 3,500 party activists Tuesday night, <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said `` the future of the party requires giving up the monopoly of power'' amd many opposition demands are acceptable, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. Differences exist, he added, but `` we shall have to get used to making politics not only with those who agree with you.'' <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said Civic Forum's demands that the the party disband the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Militia </ORGANIZATION>, its private army, and get out of the workplace were `` totally unacceptable,'' however. Civic Forum has also demanded the resignation of President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> by Dec. 10. <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, who is closely associated with <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s ouster, was quoted on the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> as saying he was unwilling to step down before his current five-year term, his third as President, ends in May.

 A deadlocked jury prompted a judge to declare a mistrial Wednesday in the racketeering case of three 1970s radicals, two days after they were cleared of charges of plotting to overthrow the government. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> granted a defense motion for a mistrial after the jury announced for the third straight day it was unable to decide whether the group's alleged bombing exploits constituted racketeering. Prosecutors claim <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> were part of a group operating under the names <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Melville-Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Unit that took responsibility for a string of bombings and bank robberies along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> from 1976 to 1984. One of the bombings, at a courthouse in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in 1976, cost one man his lower leg. Some other bombs failed to explode. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> already are serving lengthy terms for convictions in connection with some of the bombings. <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>'s wife is free on bail after serving 3 -LCB- years of a five-year term for harboring a fugitive, her husband. Young set a hearing Jan. 5 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, at which time the government will decide whether to retry the racketeering conspiracy charges. Defense attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> called for an end to the proceedings. `` What we ask is that everybody call -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney -RRB- <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>, that everybody call the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and ask that this farce, this fiasco be stopped,'' <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> said. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Loucks </PERSON> declined to comment after the mistrial was declared. On Monday, after 19 days of deliberations in the yearlong trial, jurors delivered a partial verdict acquitting the trio of seditious conspiracy to overthrow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. At the time jurors said they seriously doubted they could reach agreement on the racketeering charges. The defendants had no visible reaction as the mistrial was announced, but immediately handed out a prepared statement claiming the government had suffered a `` significant loss.'' `` We commend the courage of the jury in the face of a very vindictive and politically motivated prosecution,'' the statement said. Jurors had already cleared Mrs. <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON> of racketeering and were deciding the same charge against the two men as well as a charge of racketeering conspiracy against all three. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and $ 20,000 in fines. The racketeering charges include 15 successful or attempted bombings of courthouses, banks, corporate offices and military recruiting and reserve centers. Originally, eight people were indicted. Some charges were later dropped and other defendants have been convicted in separate trials on some of the bombings. The <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> prosecution pulled the case together through racketeering laws that allow several people to be tried for incidents occurring in several states.

<HEAD>Nuclear Industry Applauds New Approach to Opening Waste Dump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nuclear industry on Wednesday applauded the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to sue <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> over its refusal to allow construction of a high-level nuclear waste dump. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s governor said, `` We're not going to be influenced by threats. The department announced Tuesday night it would give <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> 30 days to grant the environmental permits needed to study the proposed dump site at <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>. After that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will take the state to court, Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told a nuclear industry meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said Wednesday the state would not back down from its opposition to the dump, which would entomb tons of radioactive wastes for 10,000 years. `` We're not going to be influenced by threats when we have already taken conclusive and decisive action in expressing our opposition to the dump,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` They want us to take this like a dose of castor oil,'' he said. `` But this is n't castor oil they want us to swallow. This is poison.'' <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> has fought the project since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> declared in 1987 that <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, situated about 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, would be the only site considered for a dump. Earlier this year the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill prohibiting the federal government from placing any high-level nuclear waste in the state. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the department had given up trying to persuade <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> to drop his state's opposition to the project. `` Court is not our preferred course of action, but enough is enough,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> also announced that <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had decided after lengthy review of the <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> project that all sub-surface testing of the site would be put off for two years. That, in combination with other changes in the project, means the dump will not open before 2010, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. The department originally planned to the open the dump by 1998. Last year it pushed the target date back to 2003, but failure to complete surface-based testing and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s refusal to grant environmental permits has forced a further delay. Nuclear industry groups cheered <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s announcement, despite the fact that it pushes back by seven years the date when utilities can get rid of the tons of high-level waste they have been `` temporarily'' storing at reactor sites for three decades. `` The announced delay in the completion of the waste repository is regrettable,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awareness </ORGANIZATION>, the nuclear industry's main lobby group. `` But the important thing is that <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> has ... a plan that puts us on a path toward resolving the administrative and political problems. ...'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the trade group of investor-owned electric utilities, said it was pleased that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had developed a plan to revitalize the project. `` We have long recognized that the repository would be delayed; we just hope that the new schedule is realistic,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, the group's senior vice president. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s announcement also brings to the fore a related dispute between the state and federal governments over whether to build an interim dump for nuclear waste. The interim facility originally was proposed for <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, but the state fought the project and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered a special commission to recommend how to proceed. The commission earlier this month told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that some form of interim storage was needed because of uncertainty about opening the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> dump, but it made no recommendation on where the interim facility should be built. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the department would press <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for legislation to build an interim facility. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> also announced that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had sent to the White House a suggested nominee to be director of the civilian nuclear waste management office, which has been without a permanent director for two years. Department officials on Wednesday declined to identify the proposed nominee, but congressional and other sources have said it is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, a former nuclear engineeering executive. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a department spokesman, said <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> has been hired as a consultant to <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> on `` waste management issues.'' She declined to elaborate.

<HEAD>Changes in Eastern Europe Creating Instability, Webster Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rapid change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has created a new and uncertain era where hope for the demise of communist systems is accompanied by dangerous instability, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` As the hard edges of the world recede, the threats we face have become more numerous, more diffuse and more difficult to define,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. He said intelligence that concentrates on counting Soviet military forces and tracing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s influence around the world is giving way to the need to spy on drug traffickers, assess Third World conflicts and verify arms-control treaties. Moves in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will open new economic opportunities for the West, he said. But those moves also represent `` the most immediate threat to internal political stability. The reformers face stiff odds'' because of the need for economic austerity measures that will bring popular unrest, he said. As the Soviet grip on its satellites loosens, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and spy services of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies agree that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s own intelligence activities around the world are growing, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. `` Around the world, our stations are reporting more aggressive action, a more robst intelligence-collection effort, more efforts to recruit our embassy and intelligence personnel than we have seen in a long time,'' he said. Many of the moves appear aimed at stealing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or allied technology, he said. `` As less money is dedicated to that particular effort inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, more and more effort needs to be applied to obtain that kind of technology through clandestine means. And that's what we're experiencing.'' Much of his speech appeared to be a plea to head off budget cuts for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and other intelligence agencies in the government as the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> _ in whose budget most intelligence operations are hidden _ prepares for substantial cuts in the next few years. While the precise figures are secret, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence reportedly spends $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion a year, just under 10 percent of the defense budget. He conceded that intelligence, after receiving substantial budget increases in recent years, may be in for `` a period of flat budget growth.'' `` The lowering of the military threat only advances other responsibilities of ours,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said, particularly in the areas of arms-control verification. The agency now is watching implementation of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty at 120 sites inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. If a strategic arms treaty is concluded, monitoring will involve 2,500 sites, he noted. The agency is in the middle of an expensive five-year bolstering of its satellite spying capability. On other topics, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said: _ The Salvadoran <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> rebels continue to `` make a symbolic and important statement about their ability to keep causing trouble'' through urban attacks, but pose no threat to the rightist government of <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> It is clear the rebels are receiving Soviet bloc weaponry and `` we have a right to assume a Soviet involvement.'' _ It is time for the debate over a longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ban on participation in assassinations of foreign leaders, revived after a failed coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, to fade from public attention Ambiguities about the policy with congressional overseers have been eliminated and it is now clear that the risk of violence in a coup `` is not to be equated with participation in assassination.'' _ He will not predict whether President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will sign a bill authorizing intelligence activities for the coming year that would create for the first time an independent inspector general at the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> The inspector general would answer to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as well as the agency director, which `` will have adverse effects on our liaisons with other intelligence agencies'' because they will be less inclined to trust what they say will be kept secret, he said. `` If it becomes law, we will do our best to make it work.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Abortion Parental-Notice Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was asked Wednesday to rule that most young girls have no right to abortions without first telling their parents. The justices, who have allowed limits on the availability of abortions for minors in the past, questioned lawyers defending and attacking parental-notification laws in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. In two hours of relatively narrow arguments, they gave no sign they are considering the broader possibility of scrapping the court's 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision that legalized abortion _ an idea much discussed outside the court whenever they take up any abortion case. `` The court showed no interest in overturning a woman's constitutional right to abortion,'' <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sogg </PERSON> said after the argument session in which she attacked the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Chief Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON> agreed. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> should be on the table in this case,'' he told reporters after defending his state law before the court. Last July, the court voted 5-4 to give states more authority to regulate abortions for all women. Four justices appeared ready to go even further and overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, but Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> refused. Groups on both sides of the abortion issue had looked to the court this term to help clarify its allegiance to the 1973 decision. But settlement of an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> dispute over regulating abortion clinics _ a case that was to be argued before the justices next month _ may have eliminated the greatest immediate threat to <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. The Illinois settlement still must be approved by a federal judge. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> is expected to play the pivotal role again in the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> cases, to be decided by July. At issue in both are laws requiring parents to be notified before abortions are performed on unmarried girls under 18 who are still supported by parents. About half the states have laws requiring parental notification _ or even parental consent _ in such cases, but most of the laws have been invalidated after court challenges. Nationwide, about 40 percent of the nearly 1 million teen-agers who become pregnant each year seek abortions. Of the 1.5 million legal abortions performed annually since 1973, about 12 percent _ 180,000 a year _ have been for girls 17 and younger. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law requires that one of a minor's parents be notified by a doctor at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed. The girl can avoid telling her parent if she persuades a judge she is mature enough to make the decision on her own, or that telling her parents is not in her best interest. The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law requires that the minor's two biological parents be notified at least 48 hours before she has an abortion. A judicial bypass alternative also is provided. Both <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s lawyer, and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Eppler </PERSON> argued that states do not have to provide a judicial alternative in such cases. But because both states do provide them, the court might not have to say. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, vigorously questioning <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON>, seemed deeply troubled by <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s two-parent requirement. `` The statute just does n't provide for any exceptions, even when it's not in the child's best interest,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` How do you defend the state's interest'' in requiring both parents be notified, she asked <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> also quizzed Ms. <PERSON> Eppler </PERSON> about that portion of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law requiring a girl to prove her maturity by `` clear and convincing evidence.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> asked whether the standard might be too stringent, resulting in a `` greater risk of erroneous deprivation'' of a minor's abortion right. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> never has said whether she believes such a right to abortion _ for any woman _ exists. The court in 1981 allowed states to require parental notification before minors' abortions, but the focus in that <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> case was limited to how the state law was applied to `` immature'' minors. Ms. <PERSON> Eppler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law `` represents no undue burden,'' and properly balances a minor's rights with the need for parental involvement `` when their daughter faces perhaps the most serious dilemma of her young life.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Sogg </PERSON> warned the court that `` not all parents are loving.'' She said many girls seeking abortions need to be protected from parental retaliation and abuse. The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law was in effect for five years before being ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge. A federal appeals court later ruled that the law is valid, but blocked its enforcement pending <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> action. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law, enacted in 1985, never took effect due to a successful legal challenge by an <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> abortion clinic and one of its doctors.

<HEAD>Thwarted Romance Involving Exchange Student Prompts Protest</HEAD>

 About 100 students walked out of class in freezing weather to protest what they considered an attempt to break up a relationship between an exchange student and a high school senior. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPointe </PERSON>, 17, and her boyfriend, <PERSON> Iiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Kiviniemi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, were infuriated when exchange program officials transferred <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> to a school in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, saying the relationship was hurting his grades. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said he was given two hours' notice on Nov. 11 that he was being moved from <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION> to live with a new host family in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, about 90 minutes away by car. `` I have been treated unfairly,'' <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> told Foster's Daily Democrat. `` I would be happier in <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, program coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> was moved because his grades began to drop and he was not spending enough time with his host family. The host family has repeatedly refused to comment on the issue. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said he had been given two weeks to break up with <PERSON> LaPointe </PERSON> and was told he might be sent home if he continued to see her. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the two were not told to break up, but that <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> had been told he was seeing too much of <PERSON> LaPointe </PERSON> and not enough of his host family. As a show of support for the couple, about one-third of the student body walked out of <ORGANIZATION> Farmington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Monday when the 8 a.m. bell summoned the start of classes.

<TEXT>
 The Kremlin's latest bid to break a bitter territorial dispute between <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> was met Wednesday with demonstrations, strikes and angry criticism from both sides. On the final day of its fall session Tuesday, the Supreme Soviet parliament overwhelmingly approved a directive disbanding a special commission that had imposed direct rule from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the disputed <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> territory. The territory is located inside <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> but the the majority of its population is Armenian. The decision appeared to give ultimate control over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> back to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. It ordered <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> officials to work with reinstated local officials from <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to ensure law and order, economic and cultural development in the region. It established a parliamentary oversight commission and said that soldiers would remain in the region to ensure stability during the transition. Officials of that commission have acknowledged that despite the presence of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers a virtual civil war has raged there. The region's Armenian population, supported by the neighboring Armenian republic, has demanding that it be annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> because of what it calls years of willful neglect by <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> authorities. `` The whole resolution does n't suit us,'' said <PERSON> Ektibar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamedov </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bobkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Arargetsyan </PERSON>, an Armenian activist, said the decision by the Supreme Soviet parliament proved legislators `` ca n't make a political decision based on the internationally recognized right of self-determination.'' <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakhshyan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the disbanded commission in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s main city, said by telephone that few people were happy with the decision. Activists from both sides said a general strike was under way in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Thousands of people gathered in the Armenian capital <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Tuesday to protest the decision, said <PERSON> Arargetsyan </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. A joint meeting of the Armenian Supreme Soviet legislature and <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> legislators was scheduled Thursday, he said. In a continuation of the violence that has killed scores of people since February 1988, <PERSON> Arargetsyan </PERSON> said a policeman was killed in a border region between the two republics on Wednesday. He had few details and the report could not be confirmed independently. Deputies from <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> walked out of the Supreme Soviet session on Tuesday to protest the resolution, and <PERSON> Arargetsyan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official Golust Goloyan appeared on local television Wednesday night to criticize the Supreme Soviet's move. But <PERSON> Mamedov </PERSON>, the Azerbaijani activist, claimed that there was a secret point to the agreement that prevents <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> from interfering in the affairs of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. He predicted more violence in the mountainous region.

<HEAD>De Klerk Says Media Restrictions to Be Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said Wednesday the government is considering changing the 3-year-old emergency restrictions on the press in a way that will address the difficulties of journalists and editors as well as security concerns. In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said the government does n't want to place any unneccessary obstacles in the way of the press, because, he said, it has an important task to perform in the debate on changing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He said the whole question of the national emergency was under constant review and it would be lifted as soon as circumstances permit. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> had been expected to make a more substantive statement on the emergency media regulations, which prohibit journalists from covering or reporting on unrest events or security force action, boycotts, strikes, statements the government considers subversive, and detentions without trial. The restrictions are not uniformly obeyed, and scores of journalists have been repeatedly arrested at the scene of news events. Several newspapers have been closed without recourse to the courts, and one, the New Nation, is under threat of a second closure. One newspaper editor faces a prison sentence for violating the emergency regulations by quoting a prohibited person. On Friday, the government-run <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had given the strongest indication yet that some of the emergency restrictions were about to be lifted. `` The lifting of media restrictions that are no longer relevant in today's relaxed political climate will promote a more open public debate on crucial national issues and bring the country closer to more comprehensive and fruitful negotiations on a new political and constitutional dispensation,'' it said in a commentary. Former President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> declared the national emergency on June 12, 1986, and renewed the emergency restrictions in 1977, 1988, and 1989, saying they were necessary to control a situation of political unrest in black townships. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was ousted in August, and <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> became acting president before leading the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government to a parliamentary victory in September. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> already has modified the emergency regulations, by allowing outdoor political rallies and marches, which had previously routinely been broken up by police. The prohibition remains on the books and can be invoked at any time, along with bans on many forms of political expression, including wearing T-shirts, displaying of banners and making certain speeches. The punishment for violation of an emergency regulation is a maximum of six months in prison or a $ 4,500 fine.

<TEXT>
 A broadcasting board has suspended the license of an Islamic radio station after its owner was convicted of defaming Jews. The decision by the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> occurred Tuesday after <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s owner and leading broadcaster, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rami </PERSON>, was sentenced to six months in prison. A district court found him guilty of broadcasting `` disparaging and deeply offending'' remarks about Jews and the Jewish religion on his local station. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member Jewish community has viewed it as a landmark case. It is only the second time that a court has overridden the right of free speech to enforce an anti-racism law barring the defamation of a people, race or ethnic group. The court reached its verdict two weeks ago after an eight-week trial. The prosecution called in distinguished clergymen to argue that <PERSON> Rami </PERSON>'s programs were anti-Semitic. <PERSON> Rami </PERSON> was convicted of 18 counts of broadcasting anti-Semitic remarks, including quotes from Nazi writings such as <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s `` Mein Kampf. He has spoken on the air of a Jewish conspiracy to achieve worldwide power. <PERSON> Rami </PERSON>, a Moroccan immigrant, has said he will appeal the court sentence. His license would be returned if the <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturns the verdict. <PERSON> Rami </PERSON> had called the verdict `` a judicial murder, a scandal.'' He said he had been judged in a political trial and accused the prosecutor of `` Zionist sympathies.'' `` I want to crush the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. ... If I am allowed on the air again, I will say the same things again,'' he said. `` Zionism, Judaism and the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are fakes.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on Wednesday called for stronger action against doctors and hospitals that provide substandard care for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said that while tougher laws are needed the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> also must begin to use the broader authority <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> granted in 1985 to punish doctors and hospitals. A report by the panel criticized the department for the delay in putting out regulations to enforce the law, which allows <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> to deny payment hospitals and physicians in cases where substandard care is provided. The department is working on the regulations, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which handles <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, the government health-care program for 33 million elderly, blind and disabled Americans. `` They're fairly controversial and complex regulations,'' he said. `` We've spent a lot of time consulting with medical care industry.'' Currently, physicians can be terminated from participating in Medicare or be fined up to the amount of the care provided, but only in cases where there has been a clear pattern of incompentence by physicians who were `` unwilling or unable'' to improve their treatment. The report said the standard that has to met is too stringent because it allows physicians to escape punishment by agreeing to taken an educational course to indicate their willingness to improve. It also said the monetary penalty is too low. HHS Inspector General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> strengthen the standard and raise the fine to $ 10,000 per case. The report also estimated that more than 800,000 errors are made each year by doctors and hospitals caring for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients, mostly by releasing them too early. `` The large number of beneficiaries who may be at risk of inadequate hospital-discharge planning is of special concern to the committee due to fears that the <ORGANIZATION> PPS </ORGANIZATION> system -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s system for paying hospitals -RRB- ... is resulting in patients being discharged faster and less stable,'' the report said. Eight Republicans on the 39-member committee, in an accompanying document, cautioned that the error estimate was derived by extrapolating from random reviews, called generic screens, which were designed to detect potential problems. An error can result from merely failing to sign a form in the proper place, they said. `` If an exhaustive look were taken at all generic screen failures, we are convinced the number of quality problems would be far below the committee report's projections,'' they said. The report said the prospective payment system, created in 1983 as a <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> cost-saving measure, `` provides the greatest profits to hospitals that give the shortest in-hospital care and the least services.'' Under the system, hospitals are paid a flat fee for each treatment they provide. The fee assumes a certain length of hospital stay and medical services.

Limits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attempts by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to keep farmers from dodging a $ 50,000 limit on federal crop subsidies probably will have little effect because farmers are creating new loopholes, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s watchdog agency said Wednesday. The department's Office of Inspector General said in a new audit report that 1987 legislative changes are scheduled to take effect this year and in 1990 for wheat, feed grains, rice, cotton, honey and other price-supported commodities. But the 1987 legislation failed to effectively limit the use of `` multiple legal entities'' and other ways to avoid the payment limitations, the report said. Federal crop `` deficiency'' payments used to make up part of the difference between a low market price and some higher price target are supposed to be limited to $ 50,000 per person. As an example, last month's average corn price at the farm was $ 2.20 per bushel. The target price for 1989 corn is $ 2.84. Farmers should get 64 cents per bushel from the government. `` However, our review determined that producers have found new, innovative ways to reorganize farming operations so that 1989 payments will not be limited significantly by the legislative changes,'' the report said. The audit report, which was provided upon request by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, followed one sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> describing the inspector general's activities for the six-month period that ended on Sept. 30. In that review, the excessive crop subsidies were noted among a number of abuses checked by investigators and auditors. The audit report released on Wednesday dealt specifically with operations of crop programs handled by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The auditors checked five state offices of the agency and 14 county offices. In the counties, 822 of 7,424 farm operating plans were selected for preliminary review. Finally, 52 farms were chosen for in-depth analysis. The review of 52 farming operations identified 12 that reorganized so that all entities _ which can be individuals, corporations, associations, trusts or other legal entities _ could continue receiving payments as `` persons'' under the program. `` For example, one operation we reviewed in <LOCATION> Tunica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, created 51 irrevocable trusts in 1989 so as not to have payments reduced,'' the report said. `` The operation involved three joint ventures -LRB- A, B and C -RRB- controlled by two intermingled families and was determined -LRB- to include -RRB- 43 persons in 1988.'' The 43 `` persons'' consisted of six individuals and 37 corporations, the report said. Owners of the 37 corporations consisted of 11 individuals and one corporation. `` Seven of the individual owners were the immediate members of the two families -LRB- a father and two daughters, and a father, two sons, and a daughter -RRB- that controlled the operation,'' the report said. If the complex arrangement had remained as it was in 1988, it would have collected no more than $ 700,000 in payments in 1989. But with reorganization, the operation is expected to collect as much as $ 1,431,576 in subsidies this year. `` One of the family members of this organization told us that the main purpose of the reorganization was to maintain the maximum program benefits,'' the report said. `` He said it became a challenge to see if he could get a trust established for all of the operation's full-time employees. He called it a profit-sharing plan.'' Although the reorganization was allowed by current regulations, auditors said the trusts themselves are believed to be `` flow-through entities'' to avoid new regulations last year limiting a person's membership in more than three entities. `` We conclude this because about $ 1.3 billion per year will be routed back to the seven immediate family members through management fees, equipment and land leases, and loans,'' the report said. No individual names were released. Here are the counties or parishes checked: _ <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Crittenden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Butte </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> _ <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Natchitoches </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tensas </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Noxubee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tunica </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>

<HEAD>NATO Troop Reductions Will Have Small Effect On U.S. Defense Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A possible agreement next year between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations to cut conventional arms and troops will have a minimal direct effect on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spending, defense analysts said Wednesday. But a reduction in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's superiority in armed forces, tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers could have an indirect impact that would result in long-term savings for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reduce their forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to 275,000 on each side. The Soviets would have to withdraw 300,000 troops while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reduce its forces by 30,000. The American cut of 30,000 amounts to less than 1.5 percent of the 2.1 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops worldwide, and the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has estimated savings from that reduction of about $ 2.1 billion annually. The current <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget is about $ 300 billion. Analysts for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, an independent non-profit research group, told a news conference that conventional arms reductions would have to produce larger savings to have a significant impact on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spending. Long-term savings could occur if after an agreement is reached creating a numerical parity between the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries and the seven <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> nations </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> decides it needs less war stocks, can rely more on reserve forces and less expensive, lighter infantry forces and limits modernization of its military hardware. At the news conference on the issue of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy after a conventional arms agreement, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s policy planning staff, said such a treaty will be a `` watershed event'' but a number of outstanding issues means the pact is not a done deal. Political developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> make it difficult to predict what the Soviet force structure will be and what levels the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will maintain in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said.

The move came after the northern republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> introduced emergency measures to prevent a mass rally planned for Friday by <LOCATION> Serb </LOCATION> nationalists seeking to topple <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s liberal leadership. Organizers had predicted at least 40,000 people from <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> would travel to the rally in <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>, the Slovenian capital. The Serbian <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> issued a proclamation calling on all Serbian `` institutions and enterprises to break all contacts with <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>.'' The alliance, a communist-led mass organization, serves as a mouthpiece for the republic's ambitious president, <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. It said Serbs will no longer allow themselves `` to be humiliated'' by <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and that `` all freedoms and human rights have been suspended'' there. The state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency carried a statement from the rally's organizing committee, calling off the rally because `` we do n't want to be greeted by clubs and rifles.'' Slovenian TV called <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s decision `` senseless'' and said the <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> leadership `` has reached the lowest possible moral and political level.'' Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, consider <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s move as a first step toward disintegration of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. The country is a loose confederation of six republics and two provinces, containing many different nationalities and religious groups. Economic problems and sinking living standards have heightened ethnic tensions. A commentary broadcast nationwide on an evening newscast said <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s decision `` complicated the political situation in the country to an extreme.'' Slovenian police said earlier Wednesday they would block all vehicles carrying Serbian demonstrators to the rally in <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>. They announced other emergency measures including banning all public rallies and gatherings of more than 30 people without explicit approval by authorities. Slovenian authorities hinted they would use force against demonstrators, who planned to travel the 550 miles to <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> by bus, train and automobile. The rally was to protest alleged harassment of the Serbian minority in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province by ethnic Albanians. The protesters reportedly demanded toppling of the liberal Slovenian leadership that they claimed supports the ethnic Albanians. They accused the Albanians of intimidating the Serb minority and forcing Serbs to leave the economically backward province. Hard-liners in the Serbian leadership supported the <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> protest. They strongly oppose the Western-style democratization processes in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, including next year's planned introduction of a multiparty system. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> advocates the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s continued monopoly on power and strong central control. It is deadlocked with <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s political future. Serbian leaders have been accusing <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> of wanting to secede from the federation, and the statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> said Serbs `` will no longer beg Slovenes not to break away from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s population of nearly 24 million includes 9 million Serbs and 2 million Slovenes. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> is economically the most developed region.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday blocked the execution of <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>, who was due to die early Thursday in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> for killing a state trooper when <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> was 17 years old. The court granted <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>'s emergency plea to save him from the electric chair, barring his execution until the justices decide whether they will hear his formal appeal to set aside his death penalty. No date has been set for the court's action on the formal appeal. <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> had been scheduled to be executed shortly after midnight. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> denied clemency to <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> on Tuesday, rejecting a 3-2 recommendation of the state's pardon board to commute the sentence to life in prison. <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>, 30, has been on death row in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> for 12 years _ longer than anyone else in the state's history. He was convicted of fatally shooting <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> in 1977 after a traffic stop by the trooper. His lawyer has argued that he should be spared because he was retarded, with an I.Q. of 76, and because of his age at the time of the crime. The 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which rejected the appeal Tuesday, said he is not retarded under standards of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retardation </ORGANIZATION>, which sets a threshold at 70.

 As much as $ 150 billion _ or more _ in taxpayers' money is likely to be wasted by the federal government in the near future because of antiquated accounting systems, lackadaisical management and hollow commitments to doing better, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was told Wednesday. Its investigative agency, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said problems exist in every major federal department and agency. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the shoddy government oversight of how its money is spent is years' old in some cases and blamed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration deregulation and staff cutbacks for much of the problem. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also said that an ongoing audit of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had found its financial statements `` dead wrong ... in practically every area'' and cautioned that conditions likely were worse in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> because the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is believed to have superior records. `` There is a seemingly never-ending and costly trail of mismanagement, abuse and illegal acts involving federal programs,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said in the report to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most of the problems are known, and in many instances have been known for years, but they remain uncorrected.'' Comptroller General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, said the government has wasted hundreds of millions of millions of dollars on systems designed to improve accounting that proved virtually useless. What's more, he said, many identified problems remain uncorrected because government managers charged in a 1982 law with identifying flaws treat them `` just as a paperwork exercise.'' He said the government needed to make a major investment in state-of-the-art accounting and financial-management systems but said he did not know how much that would cost. He recommended the appointment of a government-wide `` chief financial officer'' to oversee government spending, with deputies at each major agency who would be required to file detailed monthly and annual financial reports. The chairman of the committee, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said he would press for passage of legislation creating those posts when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns next year. `` This -LRB- government -RRB- being one of the biggest businesses in the world, we've just got to do it,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said the multibillion dollar scandals involving the savings and loan industry, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s troubled nuclear plants were likely to be followed by billions more in fraud, waste and abuse for a common reason: lousy management. `` We have every major agency in the federal government acknowledging that they have weak financial management sytstems,'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said, adding that the government was `` bound to end up with scandals and fraud and mismanagement.'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said the Office of Managment and Budget, a White House agency, recently had improved its efforts to identify problems areas. He said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> too was launching a government-wide review to identify the potential for costly waste and abuse. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>; the Medicare system; the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the government insurer of private pension systems, and student loan programs already had been placed on <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s priority watch list. Likely to be added, he said, were a host of government insurance, credit and financing programs, including the <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, foreign military sales accounts and the new agency set up to bail out failing S & amp; Ls. He said $ 150 billion `` was not unrealistic'' as an estimate of waste and fraud likely to occur in the near future, a figure that did not include the two-year <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> audit, which <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said had not reached the point at which he could put a price tag on the problem. That report is due in January and the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> plans a follow-up audit before moving on to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said Reagan-era deregulation and staff reductions were made at a time the government `` had no plan to achieve the cutbacks and not lessen our oversight and control. ... We have been penny wise and really pound foolish.'' Complicating poor oversight and accounting has been the rapid turnover among senior agency political appointees and the reluctance of Cabinet members to tackle complicated management problems, he said. `` The great turnover of the presidential appointees is a great problem for our government,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also has contributed to the problem by placing certain programs _ including the savings and loan bailout _ `` off budget'' to keep their costs from affecting the federal deficit. `` We see a trend here of going ` off budget' but not for a moment reducing the risk to the American taxpayer,'' he said. `` The hollow government is really happening and I'm afraid it's going to get more hollow because of the budget deficit.'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report on compliance with the 1982 Financial Integrity Act, which required agency managers to report annually on potential weaknesses in government management. Half of those managers have not been trained to prepare the required reports, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found.

<HEAD>De Klerk Promises Statement on Police Death Squads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> declared Wednesday that no one can kill with impunity, and said he will reveal next week what the government plans to do about alleged murders by police death squads. In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said his Cabinet had received an official report and was giving it urgent attention. He said criminal action in government service would not be tolerated. The report, completed Tuesday by a provincial attorney general and a police commander, covers a five-week investigation of claims by three former policemen that they were in death squads that killed opponents of the government. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> did not say whether he had seen the report, which was presented Wednesday to Justice Minister <PERSON> Kobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, the law and order minister. `` We believe that nobody has the right to take the law in his own hands,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said. `` The misuse of rights, to exercise violence against the life and property of people, must be opposed and punished wherever it occurred.'' New allegations about death squad activity were made in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> on Tuesday by a 27-year-old South African who identified himself as <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> and said he was a cousin of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>. On Wednesday, the general said he had no knowledge of a relative named <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it was not ready to comment on the man's allegations that his former army unit had carried out attacks on civilians. The state <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which reflects government thinking, said `` the very idea of a police assassination squad operating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is so monstrous as to be almost unbelievable.'' `` It is absolutely essential that the facts are established.. in a manner that leaves no room for doubt that justice had been done,'' it said in an editorial. `` Unless justice is not only done, but seen to be done, those allegations will be believed, and exploited for propaganda, in quarters hostile to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' In a speech at a police parade Tuesday, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said strong action would be taken against any officers implicated in death squad activity. He added that most policemen behaved `` in an impeccable manner'' and did not deserve to be `` dragged through the mud.'' He also announced steps to reduce military and police influence on national security policy. They include abolishing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, set up by former President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to coordinate a strategy that included suppression of activists and improvement of black communities. Several newspapers suggested Wednesday abolishing the Security System was a prelude to partial or total lifting of the state of emergency <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> declared on June 12, 1986. The system is dominated by officers of the security forces and reports to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of generals, police commanders and certain Cabinet ministers. Critics said it usurped the powers of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and municipal governments and set policy on the international, national and local level.

<TEXT>
 A former Nazi SS sergeant suspected of the 1944 death camp execution of German Communist leader <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Thaelmann </PERSON> has died. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>, who served as a guard at the <LOCATION> Buchenwald </LOCATION> concentration camp, died Sunday at his home in the town of <LOCATION> Geldern </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Rheinische </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported Wednesday. He was 78. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> was said to be in frail health. He had lived in Geldern near <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s border with the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> for more than 10 years. In May 1986, <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> was found guilty of complicity in the shooting death of Thaelmann at <LOCATION> Buchenwald </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thaelmann </PERSON> was imprisoned when the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> took power in 1933. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> was sentenced to four years in prison by a court in <LOCATION> Krefeld </LOCATION> but remained free pending an appeal. Prosecutors had argued <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> personally ordered <PERSON> Thaelmann </PERSON>'s execution and that <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> carried out the orders. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> denied the charges. The case was appealed to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which overturned the verdict because of a legal error. Two years later, <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> was retried and acquitted of the murder charges by a <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> state court. The court said there was insufficient evidence. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> served five years of a separate 20-year war crimes sentence imposed by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military court in 1947. His later prosecution was delayed by bureaucratic wrangling complicated by the failing memories and deaths of witnesses.

 Romanian gymnast <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, who spun and vaulted her way into sports history with scores of perfect 10s at the 1976 Olympics, has fled her homeland, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s news agency reported Wednesday. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, 28, told border guards she left her rigid Communist country `` for the sake of freedom,'' the <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. Her whereabouts were not known. The agency initially reported she had applied for political asylum but later said she had been granted a temporary residence permit, valid for three days. At the age of 14, the solemn, 4-foot-11 <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> astounded the world with the first-ever perfect scores in gymnastics, winning three Olympic gold medals on the uneven bars, balance beam and overall competition at the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> games. During a career that lasted until 1984, <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> won 21 gold medals in Olympic and other international competition. After ending her competitive career, she turned coach and referee and served as a role model for Romanian youth. Because of her achievements, <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> was made a Hero of <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> by President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leader who has refused to bend to the wave of reform sweeping the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. At one time, she was linked romantically with <PERSON> Nicu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, the president's son. She reportedly lived a comparatively plush life in a country notorious for its chronic shortages of consumer goods, as well as for the <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> brand of neo-Stalinism. About 25,000 Romanians have fled to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> the past two years. Despite the adulation of her countrymen and the rewards of her government, <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> often expressed dissatisfaction with the demands of her career. She repeatedly complained of exhaustion, overtraining and physical disorders as a result of her rigorous training and competition schedule. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> complained to Hungarian border officials that her government had refused to let her work or even travel abroad. She received the temporary residence permit in <LOCATION> Szeged </LOCATION>, a town about 15 miles from the Romanian border. Hungarian radio reported that <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> made a pre-dawn crossing Tuesday into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> by car at the nearby border town of <LOCATION> Kiszombor </LOCATION> with six other Romanians, who were not identified. Citing unconfirmed reports, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> and her companions Wednesday left the <LOCATION> Szeged </LOCATION> hotel where they had been lodged by police in a car bearing non-Hungarian plates, and had not been seen since. <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fretyan </PERSON>, an editor at the Szeged radio station told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> was believed to have left for <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, about 110 miles away, to stay with friends. The residency permit allows unrestricted travel throughout <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> refused to disclose <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>'s whereabouts and told The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> that the former Olympic star did not wish to give any interviews. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>'s former coach, <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Karolyi </PERSON>, defected in 1981 while on an American tour with the Romanian gymnastics team. `` I'm ready to help her in any manner if she needs it,'' said <PERSON> Karolyi </PERSON>, who became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen last spring. Her defection `` is what I was really wishing would happen one of these days,'' he said in an interview from <LOCATION> Clarens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, where he was coaching the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> women's team at an international meet. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> `` is still a big personality in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. She has nothing against the <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> population, but just like me she was chased out of the country by the Romanian authorities,'' <PERSON> Karolyi </PERSON> said. The coach said he would recommend that <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of the opportunities there. Officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said there was no immediate indication she would try to gain admission to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I am not aware of anything right now,'' said <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> has said in the past that she was offered coaching jobs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> but she did not say where. <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Auer </PERSON>, a spokesperson for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Gymnastics Federation in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, said: `` We have no official word on any offers, but that would n't surprise me. There have been no overtures from the federation.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON>, convicted of having sex with a 16-year-old girl, has left for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> while a state court hears arguments in his appeal but is `` upbeat'' about his prospects, an aide said Wednesday. The 58-year-old Republican from <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> was convicted May 26 of contributing to the unruliness of a minor and was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a $ 500 fine. He is appealing to the 10th <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> while free on bond. Oral arguments were scheduled for Thursday morning. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> left Wednesday for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> with four other congressmen to oversee elections there on Friday, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' chief of staff <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> refused a request for an interview on the advice of his attorney. `` I can tell you that he's very upbeat about it, but he will be nowhere near <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was convicted after a five-day trial in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Domestic Relations Court. The girl, <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, and her mother, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>, had charged that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> knew she was underage when he paid her to have sex at his <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> apartment in November 1988. The girl is now 17. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, who did not testify at the trial, had denied the allegations. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>'s complaint to a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> television station last year led to the congressman's indictment in February. She testified at the trial that during a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> in November 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> offered to find her a government job after she accused him of having sex with her daughter.

<HEAD>Judge Sues Airline Over Luggage Delay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A state supreme court justice who is suing <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> over a delay in getting his luggage has filed more papers in the case, this time likening himself to <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Quixote </PERSON> as he seeks $ 38,000 in damages. Justice <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> filed a lawsuit in July seeking the damages from the airline as well as a $ 3,000 speaking fee for telling passengers what he thought was the delay in receiving their luggage. The July incident was `` vexatious,'' <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said in papers filed Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> Kanawha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to try to force the airline to supply information. `` After standing around in a confined space at about 88 degrees Fahrenheit at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for over half an hour, plaintiff and about 150 other passengers concluded that their baggage was in imminent peril of taking an unscheduled trip to their plane's next stop, <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said in the documents. <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>, who had flown from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he was told by a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> employee that the plane's cargo door was jammed and he stood on a luggage conveyor belt to relay that information to other passengers. `` Plaintiff was mistaken for a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> employee and subjected to obloquy, ridicule, contempt and abuse _ <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Quixote </PERSON> doing a good deed for the galley slaves,'' the justice said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the airline denies that <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>'s luggage was delayed and said his suit is intended to harass the airline. `` We have previously said we believe the lawsuit to be frivolous, and we intend to defend it vigorously, and we intend to be successful in that defense,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. The documents filed were <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>'s second attempt to get the court to force <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> to provide all statements issued or published by <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> about employee compensation through July 1989. <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> claims that <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, under <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, instituted policies it knew would `` lower employee morale, create an atmosphere of passive resistance amoung defendant's lower echelon employees and inevitably result in the abusive treatment of passengers.'' `` At trial plaintiff will try to prove that Mr. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> has diverted money from passenger amenities _ particularly sufficienty personnel competently to handle lost and delayed baggage claims _ to junk bond speculators. King called <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>'s request for documents `` way beyond the bounds of proper discovery.'' A circuit court hearing is scheduled for Dec. 14.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said Wednesday that news leaks prompted him to order a complete review of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> press guidelines to tighten the release of information. `` I expect it to result in two things: one that we will have some success in reducing the number of leaks of pending criminal investigations and, secondly ... that we speak with one voice on policy matters,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The review of the `` entire spectrum'' of public information policies was occasioned by a series of news leaks about criminal investigations, including an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe of <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat suspected of espionage, the attorney general said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has attributed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s inability so far to solve the case on news accounts that disclosed the investigation last summer. `` It was ` let's leak like a sieve' when I got here,'' the attorney general said in an often-stormy session with reporters. `` Peoples rights were being compromised, our investigations were being compromised by unauthorized disclosures of information regarding criminal investigations,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> launched a number of investigations of leaks, notably to try to identify the source of information about an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into financial practices in the office of Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa. The leak occurred while <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was seeking election in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as majority whip, prompting accusations from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s aides were the source of a political leak. The political firestorm also forced the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to state several days later that <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was not a target of the investigation and was cooperating with the probe. Asked if he was satisfied that leak did not come from his office, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said: `` I have n't had an oportunity to review the results of the investigation.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> disclosed the department-wide review, which began earlier this fall, when questioned about proposed <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> regulations that would restrict reporters interviews of federal inmates. Later in the day, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> issued a statement saying he had ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> to withdraw the proposed regulations, saying `` this proposal was submitted prematurely and without my personal review. It will be subject to further review before resubmission.'' The regulations published this week would allow prison wardens to bar reporters who do not `` verify any allegations'' about prisons or inmates with corrections officials. During his session with reporters, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the proposed regulations are intended to guarantee `` an accurate flow of information ... and observe what is necessary to properly manage prison facilities.'' The attorney general did not cite specific examples of inaccurate news stories, referring all questions to the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>, where a spokesman did not immediately return a reporter's telephone call The department-wide review has also resulted in a new policy at the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> McNary </PERSON>, the new immigration commissioner, recently ordered <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials nationwide to obtain permission from the agency's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> public affairs office before commenting publicly on a wide range of issues `` It is necessary for us to speak with uniformity in discussing INS policies, operations, procedures, and other issues,'' <PERSON> McNary </PERSON> said in a Nov. 27 memo. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON> said district and regional officials will have discretion to answer reporters' questions about arrests of illegal aliens or breaking news. `` It's not a gagging, its not a silencing,'' <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON> said. `` It's a means, I will use the word of controlling, of knowing what is being said in the field before you read it in the newspaper or see it on television,'' <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s session with reporters was punctuated by complaints that the attorney general had made it difficult for reporters to get even the most basic information about department operations. `` Our subject is ordinary information, not sensitive information, not criminal information,'' said one reporter. `` We try to give it as best we can,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` But we're not getting it,'' the reporter replied. The attorney general acknowledged that `` my reputation with you folks has deteriorated because you do n't like the fact that I do n't condone leaks or encourage leaks. `` We're not talking about leaks,'' the reporter repeated. `` I am,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> replied. `` I am talking about what has impelled me to try to tighten up the process of discussion of matters'' in the department.

 Soviet officials rejected West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s German reunificiation plan Wednesday, the first day of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. They said a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could upset European stability. As the Soviet president was hailed in the streets of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> by throngs shouting, `` Bravo, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON>, bravo!,'' a Soviet spokesman dismissed the 10-point plan for phased reunification of the two Germanys outlined Tuesday by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. The rejection showed mounting Soviet concern that the Kremlin's tolerance of democratic reforms in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc could be used to disrupt <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s vision of a `` common European home'' erasing the lines between East and West While <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met privately for more than 1 -LCB- hours with Premier <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> expressed <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s concerns to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelis </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> officials, a spokesman said. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told a news briefing, `` Not one country in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is anxious to see a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because it could upset the present stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told the Italians the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would not reconsider its opposition to the <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> plan unless <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> first renounces any claim to the pre-World War II borders of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which included many areas now belonging to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other border states. A West German constitutional court ruled in 1972 that, in the absence of a treaty defining new borders, the legal boundaries of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are those that existed in 1937, before <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> launched the war that led to his death and the carving up of the German nation. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> deputy <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> rejected the <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> plan in even harsher language, calling it `` an attempt to shift the movement that started in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to nationalistic lines.'' <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> presented the plan `` without considering the opinions of other countries.'' On the first day of his three-day state visit, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> waded into cheering crowds who shouted `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>! <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>!'' as he and his wife took a whirlwind tour of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> between official talks that focused on the tumultuous changes taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On Friday, he will have a historic meeting with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The first Soviet Communist Party chief to visit <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was greeted like a conquering hero by flag-waving <PERSON> Romans </PERSON>, who rarely display any particular enthusiasm for visiting foreign dignataries. During a 10-minute stop at the <LOCATION> Colosseum </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, started into a crowd and were instantly engulfed by shouting well-wishers. Some young people began singing the `` Internationale,'' the socialist anthem, and others waved the red and yellow flag of the big Italian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, now in the midst of a soul-searching comparable to that going on among Communists in much of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Surrounded by <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> bodyguards and Italian security agents, the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> emerged beaming after shaking dozens of hands. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> in a tete-a-tete that stretched from the half-hour scheduled to more than three times that, leaving official delegations to carry on without them. In remarks prepared for a state dinner in his honor at the presidential palace, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> expressed gratitude for <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s willingness to help the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recover economically, but said that in the end only the Soviets can implement perestroika _ restructuring of the economy and politics `` It is not rare that in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> we are asked how we can be helped,'' he said. `` The biggest help consists in understanding our processes and problems. We are open to cooperation, we are favorable to its new forms. But perestroika has to be realized by ourselves. `` All the riches of the West can not substitute what we have to do ourselves ... We have enormous natural riches, a powerful production system, an inestimable intellectual potential. It is through perestroika that we have to put all of this to its best use.'' President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> toasted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with warm praise for his efforts to move from confrontation to cooperation between East and West and said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> intends to play a part in forming a united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He wished <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> well in his shipboard summit off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> this weekend with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Tests on a sample of air duct contaminated with plutonium dust at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant have revealed only a fraction of the plutonium inspectors had feared was present, officials said. Laboratory tests found only 1 -LCB- percent as much of the highly radioactive element as inspectors estimated in August, a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> official at the plant said Tuesday. Rocky Flats is the only government plant at which plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons are made. The plant, 16 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, is operated by <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for DOE. In August, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> inspectors said they found 11 pounds of plutonium in air ducts at the plant, one of the most serious recent allegations about dangerous practices at the plant. Rocky Flats' safety and hazardous waste disposal practices have come under intense scrutiny in recent months. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> inspectors raided the plant on June 6 looking for evidence of illegal waste disposal, and a special federal grand jury convened Aug. 1 to examine the allegations. The inspectors said enough plutonium dust could be clumped together in the air ducts to cause an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction, although no evidence has been found that such a reaction occurred. Inspectors had said they found one section of duct that contained 1,600 grams or 56 ounces of plutonium per linear foot, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> manager. But a detailed lab analysis showed the section contained just 24 grams or 0.84 of an ounce per linear foot, he said. However, <PERSON> Simonson </PERSON> said an analysis of one section of the duct is not enough `` to say ` <LOCATION> Eureka </LOCATION>, the problem is solved,''' and more studies are being done. In all, about 11 pounds of plutonium was estimated to be in the air ducts in buildings where plutonium is processed and fabricated. But officials now think the ducts contain only 2 -LCB- ounces of plutonium. <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> has ordered improvements in filters and filter seals, said <PERSON> Simonson </PERSON>. Also, an additional nine engineers are being assigned to safety, and ducts containing more than 70 grams or 2.45 ounces of plutonium per linear foot are being removed and replaced.

<HEAD>Bush Signs $305 Billion Defense Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday signed, with reservations, a bill authorizing $ 305 billion for defense programs for the current fiscal year, including a slash in his request for the Strategic Defense Initiative. The measure cuts $ 1.1 billion from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 4.9 billion request for spending on the SDI program, or Star Wars, in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a statement, said the measure would provide sufficient funds to `` provide a national defense sufficient to meet foreseeable threats to the national security'' in the coming year. In signing the bill, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced reservations over several provisions, including one calling on him to persuade <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners to increase their active-duty forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He also criticized a section urging him to seek a Japanese agreement to offset <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> costs of deploying forces to defend <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He said both provisions `` derogate from the president's authority'' under the Constitution <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also took issue with a section requiring him to report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on any negotiations with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies on the Strategic Defense Initiative, claiming it could compromise his authority to control sensitive national defense information. He suggested he might ignore this section, as well as some others he claimed infringed on his constitutional powers. The legislation represents the first cut in the SDI program in six years. The bill also trimmed his request for other major strategic programs such as the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles and the B-2 stealth bomber. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adopted a series of provisions intended to press <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies into accepting a greater share of the defense burden. One amendment calls on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to boost defense and foreign aid spending and requires the president to negotiate an agreement providing for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to completely offset the costs of maintaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to defend Japanese territory. A third directs the president to prepare a five-year plan for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, including a discussion of the feasibility of a reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel stationed in the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation. The legislation also reduces the ceiling on the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops overseas by about 15,000. Those troops were associated with intermediate-range nuclear weapons, which were banned by a U.S.-Soviet treaty signed in December 1988. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, officials said they now estimate that the effect of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting law covering fiscal 1990 means a $ 1.7 billion cut for the agency's spending. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, said it was n't immediately clear what the effect of the cuts would be or how they would affect manpower decisions. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said the number was a `` preliminary estimate'' pending formal notification from the Office of Management and Budget. `` We're still trying to figure out how its all going to fall,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said.

 AIDS victim <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who faced pickets and lawsuits to attend school, was scheduled for tests to see if he is strong enough for surgery. His mother, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, says <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> is scheduled for surgery to correct a hernia on Dec. 4, at <LOCATION> Riley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for Children. `` He needs it very much. He's swollen really bad,'' Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. The pre-testing was scheduled Thursday. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, 17, contracted AIDS through a blood-clotting agent used to treat his hemophilia. He was diagnosed with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome in December 1984. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> was barred in July 1985 from attending <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION> because of fear that he could spread AIDS to other students. A judge ruled the following spring that <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> should be allowed to attend school, because AIDS can not be spread through casual contact. The lawsuit and controversy split the community of <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s family eventually moved 20 miles away to <LOCATION> Cicero </LOCATION>, a town of about 3,200 people. In <LOCATION> Cicero </LOCATION>, the school system welcomed <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, but because of his hernia, and staph infections in his eyes and legs, he has not attended school much this year. `` This year's been really rough,'' his mother said. The tests Thursday are to see if <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s blood count is high enough for surgery. Hemophiliacs are subject to prolonged bleeding because they are missing a normal blood-clotting factor.

<TEXT>
 Most Americans think the nation can meet its future electricity needs without building more generating plants, and a large majority oppose expanding use of nuclear energy, according to poll results released Wednesday. The national survey, focusing mainly on energy and environmental issues, also found that most people believe the federal government should put more research focus on renewable energy sources such as solar power and less on fossil fuels such as oil. The poll said a slim majority of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> believe the quality of their local environment has neither deteriorated in recent years nor will in the near future. Smog, global warming and other threats to the atmosphere are the most troublesome of the environmental problems facing the nation now, according to the poll results. The survey was conducted by <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON>, chief pollster for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1988 campaign, and sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientists </ORGANIZATION>, a public interest group. In the polling sample of 1,200 registered voters interviewed in late October and early November, 76 percent said the best way to meet future needs for electricity is to improve energy efficiency, rather than building new power plants. When asked, `` Would you favor or oppose a proposal to build more nuclear power plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' 45 percent said they would strongly oppose it. Seventeen percent described themselves as somewhat opposed to more nuclear power, 17 percent were somewhat in favor and 16 percent were strongly in favor. Four percent did n't know or did n't answer Anti-nuclear groups said the poll showed the nuclear industry, in trying to persuade the public of a need for expanded use of atomic energy, is out of step with most Americans. `` The results reinforce a long-term trend over the past 14 years, showing increasing opposition to more nuclear power development in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Denman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The industry says its polls have shown a recent increase in public acceptance of nuclear energy. At a nuclear industry conference in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on Wednesday, utility executives predicted that growing power demands will require greater use of nuclear energy. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest nuclear utility, called new nuclear and coal plants the `` ideal way'' to meet growing power demands. The <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON> poll also said that 63 percent of respondents believe their local environment has improved or stayed the same over the past three years. Thirty-six percent said it was not as good. When asked about the coming three years, 51 percent said they expected their environment to either improve or stay the same, while 45 percent said it would worsen. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.

 Convicted serial killer <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> was sentenced to death Wednesday for a 12-year spree of sexual violence in which he murdered 16 young men and grotesquely mutilated their bodies. `` Burn in hell, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>!'' the father of 22-year-old murder victim <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> shouted as <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> was led from court. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, 44, insisted he was innocent after <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON> ordered him put to death in the gas chamber. Relatives of victims cried and hugged each other. `` If anyone ever deserved the death penalty, he's got it coming,'' the judge said, recounting the grisly savagery of one slaying which included torture by cigarette lighter, castration and mutilation. `` I do n't know of any person who could do that to another human being,'' said <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> took innocent and unsuspecting victims who he drugged, tortured and mutilated. ... He demonstrated an unbelievable, aggressive, violent tendency toward humanity. I just ca n't imagine this violence to satisfy his sexual desires,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> was convicted of murders that occurred between 1972 and 1983. Prosecutors said he picked up male hitchhikers in their late teens or early 20s, gave them drugs and alcohol, sexually tortured or mutilated them and then strangled them. Their bodies were dumped along roadsides. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol officers arrested <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> on May 14, 1983, when they pulled him over for erratic driving and discovered a strangled Marine from <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in his car. `` I sat here for a year, and I did n't see any remorse, feelings or regret,'' <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON> said. `` It seemed he was in another world during this trial.'' <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, who played with his pen cap, yawned, laughed and chatted with his lawyer during the proceeding, briefly addressed the court after sentencing. `` I have not murdered anyone and I believe a reasonable review of the record will show that,'' said <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, a Long Beach computer consultant. <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON> imposed the death sentence for 11 murders and consecutive life prison terms for the other five murders. The judge said he did that to keep <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> in custody in case all the death sentences were somehow overturned. A death sentence is automatically appealed to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> also was sentenced to 10 years in prison for three counts of sodomy, four counts of mayhem and three counts of great bodily injury. A jury of 10 women and two men convicted <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> on May 12 after a 10 -LCB- - month trial and recommended the death penalty in August Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> mentioned again a list found in <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s car which prosecutors believe contains the names of 65 murder victims. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> was sometimes called the `` scorecard killer'' because of that list. <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON> told <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> he had received letters from parents in <LOCATION> Corona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and `` somewhere in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'' whose children were missing and wanted to know if there was some way the list could divulge their fate. He did not give the families' names. <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON>, noting he was addressing <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> as an individual and not as a judge, said if the death sentence appeals fail `` you might give some thought in your waning moments to help those people out.'' Outside court relatives of victims clasped hands, hugged and cried. `` My vindication will come the day I know he's gone to the gas chamber. Then I can truly say it's over,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaul </PERSON>, mother of murder victim <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was killed at age 20. She and her husband, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, are sponsoring an initiative drive to hasten the judicial process in death penalty cases. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s case from arrest to sentencing took six years. `` People say the death penalty is not a deterrent. Sure it's not a deterrent because it's never imposed,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaul </PERSON> said.

 Legislators debated on Wednesday whether to deny immunity to a fellow member, who also is the opposition candidate for vice president, so he can be prosecuted on charges of misusing donations. A decision is expected this week in the single-house <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which is dominated by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, on whether <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> should be stripped of the immunity to which membership entitles him. <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> is the running mate of publisher <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, presidential candidate of the 14-party <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> in the Feb. 25 elections. The dispute is over <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>'s handling of a West German donation worth $ 60,000. If the assembly allows him to be tried, and he is convicted, <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> could be expelled from the legislature. The accusations originated in his own <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but he claims the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> manipulated party members. He said it is part of a `` Moscow-style'' witch hunt with which the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> hope to discredit him and the opposition alliance. `` What they want to is exhibit me, to keep me in the store window for several months,'' <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> said. `` This wo n't end until Feb. 25.'' About the possibility of losing his immunity, he said: `` Let them do it. Those who have lent themselves to this dirty maneuvering need to be taught a lesson.'' Because of infighting among alliance factions, Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> has been surrounding herself with a `` shadow cabinet'' to counter those who conspre against her close advisers. While she was out of the country earlier this month, the alliance's political committee voted to expel <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> from the campaign directorate. Opposition sources said it was done without Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s knowledge or consent, and while <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> also was abroad. When she returned to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> as the first of what she said would be 10 personal advisers, and selected two more soon afterward. The Godoy problem involves money and goods given by the <ORGANIZATION> Friedrich-Naumann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to a research center started by the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, of which he is president. Some party members said <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> had not given a clear accounting of the donation and asked the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to strip him of immunity so he could be formally charged and tried. In a letter, the foundation dismissed the allegations of mismanagement and demanded a retraction from what it called `` the pro-Sandinista media.''

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has told both <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to stop supplying arms to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a French newspaper reported Wednesday. The Soviet ambassador to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> gave the instructions at a secret meeting Tuesday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the Nicaraguan capital, according to the authoritative daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper said the meeting was apparently called by the Soviets and included high-ranking Cuban and Nicaraguan officials. The report came in advance of a weekend summit between Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> off the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. The newspaper said the Soviets hoped to gain points with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by ordering <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> to cut their support for the leftist Salvadoran rebels, the newspaper said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> backs the rightist Salvadoran government. The newspaper said the Soviets were embarrassed by the crash last weekend over <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> of a plane loaded with arms that apparently originated in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s client state. The order to stop supporting the rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, was better received in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> than <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. `` The <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> business can only worsen our isolation, even though we had nothing to do with these last events,'' the newspaper quoted an unidentified Nicaraguan leader as saying. `` This offensive and this arms shipment were organized by the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' The newspaper said the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> rulers in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> were privately furious with <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> for jeopardizing their position with other Central American nations. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> signed a 1987 regional peace plan, promising not to interfere in other countries' affairs.

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on Wednesday abruptly rescinded a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> proposal restricting the circumstances under which reporters could interview federal prisoners. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> issued a brief statement announcing his decision just hours after he had defended the day-old proposal at stormy session with reporters who cover the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Reporters sharply questioned the attorney general about the regulations, accusing the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> of seeking to control the way news organizations cover conditions in federal prisons. The regulations, published in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION>, would have empowered wardens to refuse to allow reporters to conduct further interviews if they failed to seek comment from correction authorities about allegations about prison conditions. Under the proposal, inmates would have been allowed to be interviewed by journalists once a month. No more than one interview between a prisoner and a reporter could be held each day in any facility. In his statement, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> to withdraw the proposed regulations. `` This proposal was submitted prematurely and without my personal review. It will be subject to further review before resubmission,'' the attorney general said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the attorney general had learned of the regulations Tuesday night and decided to rescind them Wednesday afternoon. <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he did not know what, if any, provisions <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> found objectionable. He said the attorney general did not outline specific objections to the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> when he announced his order. During the morning session with reporters, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had defended the proposal, stressing that he had not personally reviewed it. `` I think there is a problem that they are trying to address of reconciling their management responsiblity with the flow of information in and out of prisons,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had said. `` Let's start from the reductio ad absurdum that any prisoner who wants to talk to any reporter at any time can do so,'' the attorney general said. `` I find that unacceptable in terms of managing a prison population.'' The regulations `` are designed to ensure two things: one that an accurate flow of information and observe what is necessary to properly manage prison facilities.'' Before it was rescinded, the proposal was branded as a form of censorship by <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koren </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s national prison project. `` It is certainly an attempt to cut of any kind of criticism and to protect the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> from any embarrassments,'' <PERSON> Koren </PERSON> said. `` What is particularly obnoxious is that provison ... that requires reporters to come up with a balanced approach on the pain of not being able to get further interviews,'' <PERSON> Koren </PERSON> said. The proposed regulations said that reporters `` have a professional responsibility to make a reasonable attempt to verify any allegations regarding an inmate, staff member, or institution.'' `` To ensure an opportunity to gather complete information regarding both sides of any issue in the institution, a representative of the news media, as a condition of any face-to-face interview granted by the bureau, shall provide authorized staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> an opportunity to respond to any allegations that might be published or broadcast,'' the regulations said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the policy or requiring reporters to obtain comment from corrections officials has been existence for a decade. `` All we are asking for is if there are allegations made, we get a chance to respond.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said `` there is not a whole lot that's new'' in the proposed regulations, which were published for public comment. New elements of the regulations were the proposals to limit the number of interviews per institution to one a day and the number of meetings an inmate could have with a reporter to one a month, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said that the new regulations would not have functioned as a limit because `` we determined that the average number of interviews per institution a month was five.''

 <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the boyish <PERSON> Pied </PERSON> <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> of rock' n' roll known to generations as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s oldest teen-ager, turns 60 Thursday secluded on another continent far away from the enamored masses. The squeaky-clean packager of pop will blow out the candles on a birthday cake with his wife, <PERSON> Kari </PERSON>, and another couple somewhere in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, publicist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Shefrin </PERSON> said. No fanfare. No party. No fuss. Whether because of modesty or vanity, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> turned down an interview request. In the past, the multimillion-dollar entertainer-producer said he would prefer to `` age gracefully'' without media attention. Wrinkles can finally be seen on his boyish face, but it's hard to believe he's 60. For decades, his youthful looks were the butt of jokes. He once compared the burden to that of female sex symbols. `` They're constantly told how wonderful they look, but it gets to be a drag after a while because someday the looks have got ta go. It would be nice to be allowed to age gracefully,'' he said. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> arrived in the nation's living rooms through his `` American Bandstand'' television show, introducing teen-agers to <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON>, The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 5 and <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Bunny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hop </ORGANIZATION>, Twist and Jerk dance crazes. `` Bandstand,'' as it was first titled, hit the airwaves in September 1952 on WFIL-TV in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> as hosts. But <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> became its symbol when he took it over in 1956, and generations of teen-agers came to identify with the clean-cut, carefully suited and coiffed host. He was a friendly, hip father figure. On Aug. 5, 1957, `` American Bandstand'' debuted on the ABC-TV network, quickly becoming a national success. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' `` Whole <PERSON> Lotta </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakin </PERSON>' Goin' On'' was the first record spun on that show In March, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> hung up his saddle shoes after 33 years as host of `` American Bandstand.'' The show reigns as television's longest-lived variety program <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> lives on the beach near <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cove </LOCATION>, behind an imposing iron gate across a driveway that winds down from <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Coast Highway. He was born at the onset of the Great Depression, when the Big Band era started to flourish. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> joins other celebrity sexagenarians this year _ <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, June Carter Cash, <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Feiffer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> was unique, however, in transcending the generations with a hip music show and, in recent years, as host of the `` $ 25,000 Pyramid'' and `` $ 100,000 Pyramid'' game shows. He also produces the annual American Music Awards, the Academy of Country Music Awards, the `` New Year's Rockin' Eve'' TV bash and `` TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes.''

 Convicted killer <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> won a stay of his midnight execution Wednesday from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after spending the day with his family in the state prison's death house. <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>, 10 days shy of his 30th birthday, had been scheduled to die in the electric chair for a murder he committed as a teen-ager. But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> granted <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>'s emergency plea, barring his execution until the justices decide whether they will hear his formal appeal to set aside his death penalty. No date has been set for the court's action on the formal appeal. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had previously turned down three of his appeals. He was 17 when he shot <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> in the face in 1977 after being stopped for driving with a broken tail light. <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> had been freed six months earlier from a juvenile detention center where he served time for killing a taxi driver when he was 14. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> was the only <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state policeman ever murdered while on duty. <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> would have been the first person executed under the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s June ruling that authorizes executions of people who commit capital crimes while they were 16 or 17. Prison officials said his mother, wife, son, brother and sister-in-law were among those authorized to visit him. <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>, on death row in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> longer than anyone else, would have been the 19th person executed in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the death penalty in 1976. Nationwide, 119 people have been put to death. On Tuesday, Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> rejected a 3-2 <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> recommendation that <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>'s life be spared, and the 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> denied a ninth stay of execution. The 5th Circuit said that while <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> had low intelligence, his intelligence quotient was not low enough to call him retarded. Death penalty opponents made <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>'s case a national cause celebre, saying he should be spared because he was nearly retarded -LRB- an IQ of 76 -RRB- and because he was so young when he killed the trooper. The 5th Circuit, which rejected <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>'s appeal, said he is not retarded under standards of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retardation </ORGANIZATION>, which sets the threshhold at an IQ of 70. In the appeals court's 39-page opinion, Chief Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> wrote: `` To date, 11 different lawyers have represented <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> in the processing of 20 legal proceedings in 6 different courts before 35 different judges. The matter is being considered by this panel for the third time ... It is time to let justice be done.'' The Pardon Board on Monday recommended commuting the death sentence to life in prison after hearing testimony from <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON> and others about the killer's childhood abuse at the hands of his aunt, his limited mental ability and his remorse over his killings. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, however, cited the brutal nature of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s death, noted that the victim was a uniformed trooper on duty and said <PERSON> Prejean </PERSON>'s sentence met all judicial standards for the death penalty.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> it is guilty of `` financial terrorism'' by threatening to cut off funds to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> if the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> calls the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a nation. Arab diplomats plan to introduce a resolution changing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s status from an observer to a non-voting nation like <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Monaco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it will halt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payments if the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> approves the resolution. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is assessed $ 216 million annually, one-fourth of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget. <PERSON> Zehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Labib </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative, told a luncheon meeting: `` This is another example of financial terrorism.'' In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> ignored <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> threats and voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to help the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> teach Palestinians how to grow food in Israeli-occupied territories. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said such a policy involved the <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> in politics and said it would stop funds to the agency if it was approved. It also has threatened to withdraw from the <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have made it absolutely clear to the <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> leadership over the last few days that passing the resolution would have serious consequences for the organization,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would consult with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegates to <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> on their return from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> before announcing their next step. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the Israeli government condemned the <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> action. In the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, a vote on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> resolution has been postponed from Friday until next Wednesday. Diplomats said privately negotiations were under way on a compromise acceptable to both the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said: `` We are clearly not interested in exploring all the alternatives. We are interested in finding a way to end this particular silly idea that the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> can be declared a state here in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> when they have none of the attributes of a state.''. Upgrading the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s status would need only a majority vote of the 159 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> members. As a member of the 102-member non-aligned movement, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> theoretically has more than enough votes to prevail. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declared an independent state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, without defining its borders but presumably in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and says 117 nations have recognized it.

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> joined leading dissidents Wednesday in calling for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to remain independent, as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> began a worldwide diplomatic push to win support for reunification. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> insisted that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will remain a staunchly socialist state, sovereign and independent. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already has given its support to uniting the Germanys, whose common border is considered the dividing line of East and West and was established after the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> defeat in World War II. Soviet officials on Wednesday rejected a reunificiation plan advanced by West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and said a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could upset European stability. West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> informed <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials about the proposal in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Wednesday and planned a similar stop in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Thursday. He will brief the Soviets on it Tuesday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. About 10,000 people marched late Wednesday in a Communist Party-organized rally in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, considered a hotbed of pro-democracy opposition. `` There is no collective guilt of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' said city party leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonesky </PERSON>, referring to widespread corruption being uncovered during the leadership of ousted hard-line party chief <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. Speakers clearly rejected reunification, the official East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and other East German Communist leaders have rejected any talk of reunification, despite sweeping changes and upheavals in this troubled nation. He and Communist Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> signed an appeal circulated by leading dissidents demanding an East German state that offers `` a socialist alternative to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' It was initiated by writer <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heym </PERSON> and other East German intellectuals concerned about the nation's future. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> told the organizers in a letter: `` We have the historic duty to preserve this country with its anti-fascist ideals and traditions as a socialist alternative within German development.'' Echoing the petition's sentiments, he called for `` peace and social justice, individual freedom, freedom of travel for all and the preservation of the environment.'' His government, bowing to reform demands, already has promised free elections by early 1991 and a constitutional amendment stripping it of its 40-year monopoly on power. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> says <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> must hold free elections if it wants West German aid and closer ties. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Tuesday outlined his 10-point reunification plan, which received the approval of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s opposition Social Democrats. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> discussed his proposal Wednesday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a `` very intensive and complete telephone conversation,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> sent the plan to its embassies worldwide, and ambassadors were told `` to deliver it to the host governments'' and explain it, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, where Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began a state visit on Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told reporters, `` Not one country in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is anxious to see a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because it could upset the present stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' He said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told Italian officials that before <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would reconsider, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> must renounce any claim to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s pre-World War II borders, which included many areas now belonging to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other border states. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> deputy <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskykh </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> presented his proposal `` without considering the opinions of other countries. ... We can clearly see an attempt to shift the movement that started in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to nationalistic lines.'' Many Europeans fear a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, with a population of 80 million people, would dominate the continent politically and economically. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> sought to ease such worries Tuesday by saying a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would never again threaten <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He did not offer a timetable for reunification, but said it could take years. Reunification talk began after <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened its borders and the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> on Nov. 9 as part of a policy allowing citizens to travel freely. The moves came after thousands fled their homeland and hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding social and political reforms. The party ousted <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> Oct. 18 and the new leadership has begun exposing corruption and abuses by party members. East German newspapers on Wednesday described how former Premier <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON> turned a natural park into a private estate. <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON> was sacked from the ruling Politburo and resigned as premier Nov. 7. The official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> said he had lived `` surrounded by Western luxury'' on an estate containing houses, fruit plantations and an indoor swimming pool. East German opposition groups, church leaders and the Communists are to meet Dec. 7 for the first round of talks on reform.

<TEXT>
 Authorities Wednesday ordered the arrests of four ex-ministers, a former chief of the central bank and five other officials in connection with a $ 7 billion fraud case. It was a sensational development in the scandal, which centers on the disbanded Recadi government agency. The case is part too of a wave of corruption charges against the administration of former President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON>, who completed his five-year term in February. The country's <ORGANIZATION> Upper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday ordered the arrests of former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, who oversaw development and finance; <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Meneses </PERSON>, from the development department; <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Azpurua </PERSON> of finance; and <PERSON> Modesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Freites </PERSON> of planning. A warrant was also issued for <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Araujo </PERSON>, former president of the Venezuelan <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The court also ordered the arrests of former <ORGANIZATION> Recadi </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Egdalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastardo </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> Vice Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, and three other officials. The court had been expected to rule after state and municipal elections scheduled for Sunday. `` The warrants were issued this afternoon and have already been handed to the police, who will be in charge of executing them,'' said Judge <PERSON> Silvestre </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>. He gave no details of what the suspects were being charged with. <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, is an old personal and political rival. <PERSON> Meneses </PERSON> is reported to be in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seeking medical treatment for serious injuries he suffered in April, when he shot himself in the temple shortly after the Recadi investigation began. In a letter found at his side, addressed to his wife, <PERSON> Meneses </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> and <PERSON> Azpurua </PERSON> of trying to make him the scapegoat. <PERSON> Recadi </PERSON> was the government agency charged with distributing dollars for imports at prices much lower than those of the general market. It was set up in 1983 to soften the impact of the devaluation of the national currency, the bolivar. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> eliminated <PERSON> Recadi </PERSON> and the preferential dollar system shortly after his inauguration. Dozens of companies are now under investigation, charged with fraudulently obtaining cheap Recadi dollars through overbilling or non-existent imports. According to official figures, close to $ 7 billion ended up in private and company accounts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. A few months ago, a lower court investigating the case ordered the arrest of Argentine Finance Minister <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON>. From 1984-85, <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> headed <PERSON> Gramoven </PERSON>, a Venezuelan flour mill. He was charged with wheat contraband and exchange fraud. In October, <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> himself narrowly avoided a formal congressional investigation when two consecutive votes ended in a tie with the entire opposition voting against the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>. In another case, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciliberto </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON>'s last interior minister, is being investigated by the prosecutor general for possible misuse of public funds.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> expects <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to begin rehiring its members who ended their strike last week at the rate of about 100 a month, the union president said Wednesday. `` The airline needs some reconciliation with its traditional employees to work, because it's sure not working now,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> president. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, speaking at a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> seminar, said Eastern officials have taken a `` soft approach'' in initial discussions with pilots and flight attendants who ended their support for a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> strike after eight months off the job. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said he expects Eastern to hire back 700 union pilots. The airline, which has about 1,800 pilots, said it has no openings for the returning strikers but might accept some of the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> pilots when openings occur. About 3,500 pilots initially joined the sympathy walkout, along with 6,000 flight attendants. Some 8,500 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union remain on strike over company demands that they take wage cuts and grant other concessions. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said recent <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> defeats, including a rejection of union representation by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> employees and the failure of an employee effort to take over <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, have not weakened the union. He blamed a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bankruptcy court and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for failure to resolve the Eastern strike. The court has rejected union-backed efforts to end the strike since Eastern filed for reorganization. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to intervene in the strike and vetoed a bill that would have set up a congressional advisory commission to help settle it. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said the union is still working with the flight attendants' union and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> management to make a new offer that would prevent the airline from being taken over in a leveraged buyout. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which opposed the previous management-employee takeover, might be more willing to join a new proposal because the share price will be lower. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s stock fell after the deal collapsed, helping to trigger the Oct. 13 stock market plunge. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said that although <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> has said it foresees no further involvement in the deal _ it had planned to acquire a 15 percent interest _ talks are continuing with several foreign carriers who might join the next bid.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Communist-run <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> swiftly ended the party's 40-year monopoly on power on Wednesday and a Politburo member said <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s first free elections since 1948 could be held within a year. The move was a frantic effort to satisfy the demands of the growing pro-democracy movement here. Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said he intended to negotiate a reassessment of the 1968 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion that crushed reform in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and would be prepared to negotiate the withdrawal of Soviet troops. It was the first such statement by a top-echelon official. <PERSON> Vasil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo, told a news conference that now that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to relinquish complete control, free elections could be held within 12 months. Voting with the somber, mechanical gestures born of decades of rubberstamp approval of Communist measures, the 309 deputies unanimously scrapped Article 4 of the constitution, which mandated the leading role of the Communist Party. They also deleted a clause that bases all education on Marxism-Leninism. `` The revolution is proceeding much quicker than we expected,'' said <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON>, spokesman for the Civic Forum opposition, minutes after the vote was broadcast live on national television. The emergency parliamentary session ended late Wednesday, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The changes were among historic concessions the opposition won from the Communist government on Tuesday when <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> also promised to form a new government, including non-Communists, by Sunday. They followed 11 straight days of huge anti-government demonstrations, which culminated in a two-hour strike on Monday in which millions of workers participated. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> went on national TV and said he had asked Civic Forum for its suggestions on whom to include in the new government. Civic Forum proposed the new defense minister be a civilian Communist and the interior minister, who controls the police, be a civilian non-Communist, <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> said. Parliament also eliminated the Communists' leading position in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization embracing all political parties and social groups allowed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. State TV later showed Slovak actor <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Knazko </PERSON> announcing word of the changes to a packed National Theater in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>. The entire audience, which included prominent dissident <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, rose to its feet in thunderous, minutelong applause. Parliament also planned to consider creating a constitutional court and a commission to investigate allegations of police brutality in a crackdown on protesters Nov. 17. The removal of the requirement that Marxism-Leninism be the guiding principle of education was a prime demand of students who staged the Nov. 17 protest and have led the pro-democracy movement since. In parliamentary debate, broadcast live on TV for the first time, deputies openly admitted past party failures and said the Communists must work hard to win the people's confidence. `` We have betrayed the trust of the electorate, and whatever laws we pass today will not change this,'' said <PERSON> Blanka </PERSON> <PERSON> Hykova </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, until recently a docile ally of the Communists. <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Blazej </PERSON>, dean of a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> training academy, said: `` We have misunderstood the leading role of the party and its position. We must regain this trust.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaclavik </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, sounded a cautionary note: `` I am aware that neither the army nor the party have the best position now. We should be aware that retreats and compromises are necessary, but there are limits.'' <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Indra </PERSON>, who said Tuesday he was quitting as <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> president, delivered a formal speech of resignation to the 350-member chamber. He described the resignation as `` a logical step in the context of the present developments.'' <PERSON> Indra </PERSON> was said to be among party leaders who requested the Soviet-led invasion of August 1968 that crushed the `` Prague Spring'' of reform instituted by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief. <PERSON> Bretislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Nedbalek </PERSON>, secretary of a preparatory committee, said <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had been re-established after an absence of 41 years. At the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> prayed that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> would use its Christian traditions in building its `` new future.'' About 5,000 people attended a Communist-sponsored rally Wednesday at <LOCATION> Ostrava </LOCATION>, an industrial city near the Polish border, including supporters of the opposition group Civic Forum. <PERSON> Senek </PERSON> <PERSON> Milota </PERSON>, a local party leader, told the rally, `` We do n't want to eat soup from a charity kitchen,'' an apparent reference to the party giving up power Civic Forum backers jeered loudly, but no trouble was reported. The Politburo's <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> replied when asked by reporters when Czechoslovaks would have a chance to vote freely: `` First, it is necessary to change the laws. Most probably it will take place within a year. We do n't want the monopoly of one party to continue.'' Party chief <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said Tuesday the Communists were ready to give up their exclusive control. Despite repeated questions, <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> did not say specifically the party would hand over control if it lost free elections, but he stressed several times: `` We're a different party now, and you all should get used to it.'' He conceded the new party leadership chosen last week is under pressure from its own 1.7 million members as well as the opposition, and said a special party congress tentatively set for Jan. 26 might have to be held sooner. At a closed meeting of 3,500 party activists Tuesday night, <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said `` the future of the party requires giving up the monopoly of power'' and many opposition demands are acceptable, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. Differences exist, he added, but `` we shall have to get used to making politics not only with those who agree with you.'' <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said Civic Forum's demands that the party disband the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Militia </ORGANIZATION>, its private army, and get out of the workplace were `` totally unacceptable,'' however. Civic Forum has also demanded the resignation of President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> by Dec. 10. <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, who is closely associated with <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s ouster, was quoted on <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> as saying he was unwilling to step down before his current five-year term, his third as President, ends in May.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that 50 MX nuclear missiles will be removed from underground silos in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and placed on trains there and in six other states _ <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The announcement represents the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's commitment to push ahead with plans to modernize the nation's strategic nuclear missile force, even amid projections of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> belt-tightening, heightened prospects for arms-control agreements and sweeping changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies. The 50 missiles _ dubbed the `` Peacekeeper'' by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ will be placed on 25 trains, each with two MX missiles aboard. The trains will be kept on seven <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases and moved onto civilian railroad tracks in time of crisis. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> did not indicate how many of the missiles would be at any particular site, but did say that <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> will continue to be the main MX operating base. In a statement, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said that once the trains are sent out, they will have access to `` more than 120,000 miles of commercial track. `` This dispersal will offer enhanced -LRB- missile -RRB- survivability in the event of an enemy attack, providing the potential for prompt retaliation vital to the successful deterrence of war,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has struggled, as had the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, to develop a plan for adding a mobile nuclear missile to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s arsenal. The idea is to make it more difficult for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to target <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces and thus deter the Soviets from even considering a first-strike attack. Earlier this year, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opted to move forward with two mobile intercontinental ballistic missile systems by putting the 10-warhead MX on trains while also building the smaller, truck-based Midgetman. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision has run into considerable opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ both among those who contend the two-prong program is too expensive and among those who favor one weapon or the other. The cost of taking the nation's 50 MX missiles out of their underground silos at the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> base and building the new `` garrisons,'' or shelters, is expected to be at least $ 5.6 billion, said a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> source who requested anonymity. `` Hopefully, it will be completed by 1994, but that clearly depends on the budget,'' the source said. The Pentagon said the missile trains will be housed at these <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases: <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Fairchild in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forks </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wurtsmith </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Ten bases had been under consideration. The four rejected were <PERSON> Eaker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Malmstrom </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Whiteman </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. A spokesman at the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> base, Maj. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, said that four of the trains initially would be based at <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, with the first to be operational by 1992. The base also will serve as the training center for the six rail-garrison crews, she said. In <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Block the MX, said local activists would try to block the use of Fairchild. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed a military spending bill last week that establishes a $ 1.1 billion fund for both the MX and the Midgetman, with the exact spending split left to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. The bill also imposes a 50-missile cap on the MX. Although <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> at one point said he favored the MX over the Midgetman, the administration has since argued that both systems are necessary as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> engages the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in arms-control talks on strategic weapons, the most lethal in the superpowers' arsenals. Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that moving ahead on both the MX and Midgetman missiles would give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> more leverage at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> arms-reduction talks. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` We think a mobile capability is essential. Then you negotiate reductions as best you can.'' Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, touted the decision as a job-enhancer for his state and a chance to save the <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> base from closure as the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> trims its budget. `` Rail-garrison MX will be the mainstay of our stragetic defense well into the 21st century. So this is very good news'' for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., who chairs a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, was quoted last week as casting a doubtful eye on money for both the MX and Midgetman programs during a time of reduced Pentagon budgets `` I do n't see how we can say with a straight face that we're going ahead'' with both of them, he said

 A man accused of arranging his pregnant wife's murder watched as two teen-agers stabbed her, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfaaf </PERSON>, 19, told police that <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> offered him $ 10,000 to kill <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, according to an account of a police interview on Monday filed with <ORGANIZATION> Merrimack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pfaaf </PERSON> said he recruited <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, 19, to help kill her the night of July 28, 1988. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 37, currently of <LOCATION> Warwick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pfaaf </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wallace </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and formerly of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> were all charged with capital murder Tuesday in the woman's death. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 36, was seven months pregnant and had been married to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> for three years when she was killed. <PERSON> Pfaaf </PERSON> said he asked <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> to pretend to be someone named `` Bob'' who was to give her some money. They met <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> at the Mall of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, forced her into her car and to drive to a <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> sand pit, <PERSON> Pfaaf </PERSON> told <PERSON> Lamy </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> gave them directions to the sand pit earlier in the day. When they arrived at the pit, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> told <PERSON> Lamy </PERSON> they got out and a man, whom he assumed was <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, approached from nearby woods. `` What are you doing here?'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> asked the man, according to <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>'s account. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> responded by cursing her and accusing her of cheating on him, said <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, who had never met <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> before. <PERSON> Pfaaf </PERSON>, who also placed <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> at the scene of the killing, said his wife began to struggle and <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> stabbed her, then gave him the knife and he stabbed and choked her. <PERSON> Pfaaf </PERSON> said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> supplied them with the knife used in the killing. <PERSON> Pfaaf </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> later went to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s home in Bow where he paid them $ 10,000. Based on information supplied by <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, police circulated a sketch of `` Bob'' and tried to locate him during the months after the murder. At one point last year, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told police that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> was `` someone who put in bets for me and he owes me money.'' An investigation, however, later showed there was no `` Bob,'' and suspicions focused on <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>.

 The company operating a construction crane that collapsed and fell 16 stories, killing five people, `` has one of the poorest safety records in the industry'' in its home state, an official said. Erection Co. of <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, has been fined for safety violations at least eight times, including four since 1987, according to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> records. In August 1988, it was cited for a `` serious, willful violation'' of state safety laws after a worker fell 123 feet to his death, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Akins </PERSON>, department spokesman. Erection is appealing a $ 24,500 fine, he said. Telephone calls to company offices were not returned Wednesday. Construction officials said they have no idea why the 240-ton crane snapped and fell Tuesday morning while it was being moved to allow work at the top of a 20-story high-rise being built for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in the city's Financial District. The crane plunged 200 feet to the street, whipping into two other buildings and smashing vehicles below. Five people were killed and 21 injured. Four of those killed were jacking the crane from the 16th floor to the 20th floor of the high-rise. The other victim was the driver of a bus that was taking disabled children to school. `` This was not considered a dangerous procedure at all,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duggan </PERSON>, a vice president for the project's general contractor, <ORGANIZATION> Swinerton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Walberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Swinerton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Walberg </PERSON> itself has faced criminal negligence charges twice before, once stemming from another fatal crane collapse, according to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Deputy City Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the investigation of the accident is continuing and no possible causes have been eliminated. <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION> said investigators have `` given a low priority to wind as a factor'' and referred to the raising of the crane operation, which was underway when the accident occurred, as `` historically a very safe operation.'' The coroner's office on Wednesday identified the dead workers as <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilton </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Spanaway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Graden </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> was at the controls of the crane when it collapsed The bus driver was <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. Five people remained hospitalized Wednesday; one was in serious condition, three were fair and one was listed as good, said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. As workers cleaned up the debris Wednesday, authorities shut off the gas supply for 28 businesses in a seven-block area because of a worsening gas leak caused by the crane collapse. Workers clearing away debris found part of the crane's counterweight embedded in pavement directly over a main gas line The <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to close the area's gas supply so the counterweight could be lifted, allowing officials to survey damage to the 16-inch main gas line, said <ORGANIZATION> PG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutkowski </PERSON>. Nearly half the customers should get their gas restored by Thursday after an auxiliary gas line is installed, he said. The huge job of removing debris will probably take at least two weeks, according to an official in charge of the operation. `` It will take that just to pull stuff off the roof,'' said <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloat </PERSON>, superintendent of <ORGANIZATION> Sheedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drayage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> deputy city attorney, said charges were filed against the construction company after a crane collapsed in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1981, killing two people The case was dropped because prosecutors wanted to prove only culpable negligence, but state labor code requires proof of wanton and willful disregard for human safety, <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON> said. In 1986, <PERSON> Swinerton </PERSON> was a co-defendant with another construction company in a case involving an overloaded steel superstructure on a 21-story building in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Three ironworkers were killed when girders crashed through a floor, <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON> said. That case resulted in <LOCATION> Swinerton </LOCATION> agreeing to sponsor a safety seminar for downtown Los Angeles contractors and to make a donation to a labor safety board, he said. <PERSON> Swinerton </PERSON> did not repond to telephone calls Wednesday requesting comment on the charges. <PERSON> Akins </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state labor official, said the crane subcontractor, <ORGANIZATION> Erection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, `` has one of the poorest safety records in the industry'' in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In November 1988, the company was fined $ 41,000 for numerous worker-safety violations at an office tower under construction, said department spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunkle </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> project began in January and has received no safety citations, <ORGANIZATION> Swinerton </ORGANIZATION> officials said.

 Romanian gymnast <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, who spun and vaulted her way into sports history with scores of perfect 10s at the 1976 Olympics, has fled her homeland, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s news agency reported Wednesday. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, 28, told border guards she left her rigid Communist country `` for the sake of freedom,'' the <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. Her whereabouts were not known. The agency initially reported she had applied for political asylum but later said she had been granted a temporary residence permit, valid for three days. At the age of 14, the solemn, 4-foot-11 <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> astounded the world with the first-ever perfect scores in gymnastics, winning three Olympic gold medals on the uneven bars, balance beam and overall competition at the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> games. During a career that lasted until 1984, <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> won 21 gold medals in Olympic and other international competition. After ending her competitive career, she turned coach and referee and served as a role model for Romanian youth. Because of her achievements, <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> was made a Hero of <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> by President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leader who has refused to bend to the wave of reform sweeping the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. At one time, she was linked romantically with <PERSON> Nicu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, the president's son. She reportedly lived a comparatively plush life in a country notorious for its chronic shortages of consumer goods, as well as for the <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> brand of neo-Stalinism. About 25,000 Romanians have fled to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> the past two years. Despite the adulation of her countrymen and the rewards of her government, <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> often expressed dissatisfaction with the demands of her career. She repeatedly complained of exhaustion, overtraining and physical disorders as a result of her rigorous training and competition schedule. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> complained to Hungarian border officials that her government had refused to let her work or even travel abroad. She received the temporary residence permit in <LOCATION> Szeged </LOCATION>, a town about 15 miles from the Romanian border. Hungarian radio reported that <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> made a pre-dawn crossing Tuesday into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> by car at the nearby border town of <LOCATION> Kiszombor </LOCATION> with six other Romanians, who were not identified. Citing unconfirmed reports, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> and her companions Wednesday left the <LOCATION> Szeged </LOCATION> hotel where they had been lodged by police in a car bearing non-Hungarian plates, and had not been seen since. <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fretyan </PERSON>, an editor at the Szeged radio station told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> was believed to have left for <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, about 110 miles away, to stay with friends. The residency permit allows unrestricted travel throughout <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> refused to disclose <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>'s whereabouts and told The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> that the former Olympic star did not wish to give any interviews. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>'s former coach, <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Karolyi </PERSON>, defected in 1981 while on an American tour with the Romanian gymnastics team. `` I'm ready to help her in any manner if she needs it,'' said <PERSON> Karolyi </PERSON>, who became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen last spring. Her defection `` is what I was really wishing would happen one of these days,'' he said in an interview from <LOCATION> Clarens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, where he was coaching the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> women's team at an international meet. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> `` is still a big personality in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. She has nothing against the <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> population, but just like me she was chased out of the country by the Romanian authorities,'' <PERSON> Karolyi </PERSON> said. The coach said he would recommend that <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of the opportunities there. Officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said there was no immediate indication she would try to gain admission to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I am not aware of anything right now,'' said <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> has said in the past that she was offered coaching jobs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> but she did not say where. <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Auer </PERSON>, a spokesperson for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Gymnastics Federation in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, said: `` We have no official word on any offers, but that would n't surprise me. There have been no overtures from the federation.''

 Salvadoran diplomats closed their embassy in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and returned home Wednesday after their country suspended diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. But charge d'affaires <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Geissman </PERSON> insisted there was no break in relations between the two countries. He told reporters at the airport before leaving for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that he was just being recalled indefinitely for consultations. `` Unfortunately, there's been speculation that there's a breaking of relations between <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which is not true,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. `` It's not even a suspension ... It's a re-calling for consultations. Of course, it's much graver because it's the whole diplomatic and consular delegation'' that is leaving <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, he added. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> left together with the Salvadoran Consul, an executive secretary and their families. The Salvadoran diplomatic mission was shut down Wednesday. The Colombian Embassy in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> might look after <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> affairs, but this has not been finalized, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, he said Costa Rican Ambassador <PERSON> Farid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayales </PERSON> had agreed to act as caretaker. Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> announced Sunday he had suspended diplomatic and commercial relations with the Sandinista government, accusing it of smuggling weapons to leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> announced the break a day after authorities in the neighboring country found two small planes were ferrying surface-to-air missiles and other military hardware to the rebels. In one plane, three crew members died as a result of the crash and a fourth survived but committed suicide afterwards, Salvadoran military authorities said. They said the other plane landed and unloaded but could not take off for reasons still being investigated and the crew set the aircraft afire and fled the scene. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said `` because of the fellowship that has united the Central American countries'' the closure wo n't last long, and `` diplomatic relations can be fully re-established.'' <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> re-called its ambassador after the 1978-79 Sandinista revolution, when the embassy was fired on. Since then, the mission has been headed by several charge d'affaires. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, diplomats at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> will hold a debate Thursday on <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s complaint that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is sending weapons to the rebels. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> has requested the debate, and the council members decided to go ahead during private consultations Wednesday, the diplomats said on condition of anonymity.

 The investment banker who was raped, beaten and left for dead by a group of young men while jogging in Central Park seven months ago has returned to her job in the financial district, a source said Wednesday. The 29-year-old woman, who has undergone physical and emotional rehabilitation since her April ordeal, returned to the department she had worked in with similar duties at the <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> investment banking concern, said a court source who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. The woman's name has not been published because of the nature of the crime. She was assigned to a position advising large corporations on investments. `` I'm sure they're not going to overload her,'' the source said. `` The doctors were very concerned about the effect of stress on her.'' The woman returned to work as her alleged assailants were in court for a pretrial hearing to determine whether statements they gave to police can be used as evidence at their trial. Defense lawyers believe they were acquired illegally. She resumed working full-time Monday, the source said. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <LOCATION> Salomon </LOCATION>, said the firm would have no comment. An aunt of the jogger told <ORGANIZATION> WABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday night that her niece's `` attitude is unbelievably lovely. She has no animosity. She has the determination that ` I'm going to make it,' and she's thankful. The aunt, a school teacher who appeared in silhouette on the broadcast, said the jogger has no memory of the attack, `` and hopefully it will never come back.'' The aunt added, `` She's as sharp as she ever was, I think ... and in conversation, in her grasp of what's going on in the world, she is very cognizant of world events.'' Before the attack, according to friends and colleagues, the woman would often begin her work day at 7:30 a.m. and spent up to 12 hours in the office. The woman, who had been at a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> rehabilitation hospital, moved out of her <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment and relocated to another in the borough, the source said. According to the source, the woman has also resumed jogging with family and friends. She has told prosecutors that she is eager to testify at the trial of the six youths accused of attacking her during her nightly jog on April 19. The woman's remarkable recovery since being discovered near death in a wooded area in the park has been chronicled closely in the media and cheered by New Yorkers. According to authorities, she was jogging through the park when she was attacked by a gang `` wilding'' youths, dragged into the woods, beaten and raped. The woman had lost most of her blood and was suffering from hypothermia when she was discovered hours after the attack. Doctors initially gave her little chance of making a complete recovery.

 A <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> plane en route from <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> carrying military and other equipment for U.S.-backed rebels in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> crashed this week, killing an undetermined number of Americans and insurgents, government officials said Wednesday. The L-100 flight left a military base at <LOCATION> Kamina </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> Monday night and went down not far from the southeastern Angolan town of <LOCATION> Jamba </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels have their headquarters, the sources said, attributing the crash to pilot error. They said all the Americans on board were killed along with several <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels. Several others survived, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday night that four Americans were on board but it did not say how many were killed. The department declined further comment, except to confirm that there was a crash on Monday in a remote section of southeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and that the cause was unknown. Asked for comment, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> said, `` As a matter of policy, we never confirm or deny such reports.''

Since 1986, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been providing military aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> in its 14-year struggle against the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resupply planes secretly have been using <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> as a staging area for sending materiel to the rebel forces but Zairean President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> ordered a halt to this activity last June when he launched a peace mediation effort. During a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in early October, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials convinced <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> to allow the resupply flights to resume, the officials said. The Monday flight was the first since June. The L-100 is a civilian version of the workhorse <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> C-130 transport, powered by four turboprop engines. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> TransAfrica </ORGANIZATION>, a private group seeking to influence <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said the incident in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> reinforces his view that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> should stop. `` We have turned this African country into a graveyard,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` American participation in this devastation is morally and strategically indefensible.'' A cease-fire was agreed to in June between <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> MPLA </ORGANIZATION> government but it was broken in August and there has been intermittent fighting since then The <ORGANIZATION> MPLA </ORGANIZATION> has been backed by large-scale Soviet military aid over the years and by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops. Last December, however, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreed to remove its troops over a 27-month period that will end in early 1991. The <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> war is one of several regional conflicts in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been supporting rival factions. It is expected to be the subject of discussion this weekend at the summit meeting in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Ironically, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> flight went down just two days after a similar type of incident involving a guerrilla resupply flight occurred in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. There, a twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> originating in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> crashed while carrying Soviet bloc anti-aircraft missiles and other equipment reportedly earmarked for leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Wednesday that the Salvadoran government's domestic crackdown was an `` absolutely appropriate'' response to rebel attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other targets. Earlier, White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said when asked about the government's crackdown, `` Our response is that we deplore violence and killing on both sides.'' The leftist guerillas `` briefly overran'' the home of at least one <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officer in the early morning outbreak of fighting, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters, also saying, `` We are taking steps to assure the safety of embassy personnel.'' Administration officials said all the Americans escaped injury. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, set up a 24-hour task force to monitor the events in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The task force said in a statement that the family whose home was briefly seized had been `` safely evacuated by Salvadoran government forces'' and that the Americans were `` not actually in the hands of the guerrillas at any time.'' The rebels `` appeared to seize this residence at random,'' said task force spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>. After the pre-dawn attack, embassy personnel were told not to report to work Wednesday and the embassy was closed for the day, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Roman Popadiuk. However, said <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>, `` several families are unable to leave their homes because of fighting'' in the neighborhoods of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benito </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Escalon </PERSON> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that a charter flight might depart Thursday with embassy dependents who want to leave. Embassy personnel who planned to go home for Christmas would leave early, he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will press Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> during their shipboard summit this weekend in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The secretary said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to make sure its Nicaraguan ally adheres to Soviet assurances to the administration that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> weapons will not go through <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to the Salvadoran rebels. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has told both <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to stop supplying arms to the Salvadoran rebels. The newspaper said those instructions were given to high Cubana and Nicaraguan officials at a secret meeting in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the Nicaraguan capital, called by the Soviet ambassador. `` It's in their power to assure themselves that they will not be lied to in the future. We'd like to see them exercise that,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, referring to the Soviets. He decried `` the continuing pattern of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> arms shipments to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Third World clients,'' saying that in the case of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> it was a `` disturbing approach of throwing fuel on the fire.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> spoke a few hours before it was learned in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> plane carrying equipment to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Third-World client, the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebel movement in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, had crashed near <LOCATION> Jamba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The all-out offensive the Salvadoran rebels launched on Nov. 11, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` was made possible by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> arms.'' President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> `` is cracking down in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in an attempt to rid the streets of these terrorist guerrillas. I do n't think that that's anything but absolutely appropriate,'' the secretary said. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> told reporters that the rebels were continuing to `` make a symbolic and important statement about their ability to keep causing trouble'' through urban attacks but that they posed no threat to <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s government. Since the rebel offensive began, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s security forces have raided more than a dozen churches and refugee centers and have detained labor officials. Last week, six Jesuit priests were brutally murdered; witnesses have said uniformed sldiers were seen near the killing site. In a separate incident, seven civilians were lined up and executed on Nov. 18 in a poor <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> suburb. Witnesses saw government soldiers a block away minutes before the killings. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and his government `` understand very well that there must be complete respect for human rights in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> if they expect to contiue to receive <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> support.'' As to the resurgence of right-wing death squad activity, which in the past has been linked to <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s conservative Arena party, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` I think its important that they do everything they can to get control of that kind of activity.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was asked by reporters if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was contemplating any military intervention in light of the latest violence. He said the president `` has never ruled out any option that might be necessary to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives.'' Under current congressional restraints, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can provide 55 military advisers as part of its aid to the Salvadoran government. The presence of an additional six <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> Berets </PERSON> came to light last week when the rebels took over the Sheraton Hotel in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, where the elite troops were staying. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said those Green Berets were not part of the 55-member contingent butwere on special temporary assignment in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Wednesday's outbreak of fighting occurred in the same affluent neighborhood. Regarding the case of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> church worker <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, who was arrested by the Salvadoran government on Sunday on charges of harboring weapons, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials `` have been monitoring her case closely to assure she is well treated.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that during her four years in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> had become `` known to embassy officials through her work with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> education seminars and coordinating non-official delegations to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. ... The embassy will continue to assure that she is given every benefit due her under Salvadoran law.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>, D-Wash., who spoke with Miss Casolo in the police barracks where she is held, said in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> she `` maintained her innocence. A group of Americans headed by former Attorney General <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> planned to fly from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Thursday to see her and help slect a <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> attorney, a spokesman for the group said in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on his first visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> predicted Wednesday that the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION> will eventually be dismantled. On his arrival from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told a news conference at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> that he expected Eastern bloc defense budgets to decline gradually as democratic reforms are enacted. The global arms race will slow, and the seven-nation <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> `` will be dissolved eventually ... as the process of common sense prevails,'' he said through an interpreter. The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact was created in 1955 as a mutual defense alliance among the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its Eastern European satellites. `` It's ridiculous to destroy the earth eight times over, and they are still thinking of a ninth,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> added. `` As <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> becomes integrated economically, it becomes even more ridiculous.'' Western European nations have agreed to form an economic union by the end of 1992. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the upcoming U.S.-Soviet summit should leave the superpowers `` better prepared to make substantial progress'' on a treaty to slash long-range nuclear weapons. However, he emphasized anew that no such agreement would be reached during the two-day meeting. He also said he expected no pact on conventional forces to emerge from the meeting between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Saturday and Sunday off the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. In his comments, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he would like to see the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> expanded to embrace all of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Together we can find solutions we are proud of,'' he said. The Nobel Peace Prize-winning labor leader said his recent trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> proved to Americans that they should invest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and now he was bringing his appeal to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> has approved a three-year, $ 864.5 million aid program for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. After his tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Thursday before flying out again on a four-day trip to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Solidarity took control of the Polish government in August, creating the first non-Communist government in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc since the Communists consolidated power after World War II. Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> announced Wednesday that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will double its aid package to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to $ 77 million over a five-year period and give $ 64 million more to an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to rebuild the Polish economy. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a guest of the <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> federation, later Wednesday attended a private dinner to mark the 40th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>. The 46-year-old former shipyard electrician is to meet Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at her official residence on Saturday.

<HEAD>Supercomputer Foresees End of Amazon Rain Forest in 50-100 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new study by the Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> shows the entire <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest could be wiped out in 50 to 100 years if deforestation continues at the present rate. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobre </PERSON>, an engineer and meteorologist with the institute, said Wednesday the findings were the result of a year-long study at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> using a supercomputer belonging to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nobre </PERSON> said he used mathematical formulas to project the effects of deforestation, which he estimates destroys 14,000 square miles of rain forest a year. The computer predicted the huge wilderness could dry up and turn into a vast, scrub-covered savanna, he said. `` The advance of pasture land would profoundly change the landscape and the way of life in the region,'' the scientist said at the institute in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> dos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campos </LOCATION>, 200 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nobre </PERSON> said the destruction of trees to clear land for planting and grazing reduces the forest's capacity to retain water. As a result, temperatures will rise, rainfall will diminish and the soil will become poorer, he said. Even the water level in rivers will fall, reducing the hydroelectric potential. When that happens, <PERSON> Nobre </PERSON> said, the rain forest would succumb to a long dry season and turn into a savanna, covered with scrub trees and grass. The 2 million-square-mile Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> is the world's largest wilderness Independent studies show 12 percent of it has been destroyed, mostly by small farmers and cattle ranchers using slash-and-burn techniques. The government claims the correct figure is 5 percent. Scientists say destruction of the rain forest adds to the greenhouse effect, which traps the sun's rays and causes global warming. The Brazilian government, under fire from environmentalists, recently announced that burnings in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> were far less than in previous years.

However, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, formerly Morton-Thiokol, at <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, said the company had been asked to provide information about instrumentation in redesigned solid fuel booster rocket motors used starting with the Discovery flight Sept. 30, 1988. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, whose company makes solid fuel boosters for the shuttles, said he could not provide details on what type of information had been requested. He said the instruments fulfilled <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> requirements. A <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> engineer, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Joos </PERSON>, has said there was improper testing of booster parts. He and employees of at least one <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> subcontractor reportedly were subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. <PERSON> Joos </PERSON> had said that instruments that measure stresses on the 184-foot-long boosters were not properly inspected and could be giving engineers false information. He said that could lead to failures of the booster rockets. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> suspended shuttle flights and overhauled engines and spacecraft after the failure of a booster rocket seal caused the Challenger explosion. <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, manager of the solid rocket motor office at <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, said his office was cooperating in the investigation of <PERSON> Joos </PERSON>' charges. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s director, said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineers at <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> investigated <PERSON> Joos </PERSON>' allegations and concluded there were `` no safety issues involved'' that would require suspending shuttle flights. The <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that investigated the Challenger tragedy found that <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> engineers had pushed for the Challenger launch while ignoring booster problems. <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy administrator and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> director during the booster redesign work, said he was unaware of <PERSON> Joos </PERSON>' concerns or the grand jury probe `` I do n't know what they're talking about because all flights we have made since Challenger have gone exceptionally well,'' he said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridwell </PERSON>, manager of <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s shuttle projects office, said his engineers and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general began looking into <PERSON> Joos </PERSON>' concerns about a month ago. He said they felt sure they `` were n't related to safety issues.''

<HEAD>Challenger Formally Nominated to Run Against Thatcher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sir <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, a rank-and-file member of the governing Conservatives, was nominated for party leader Wednesday in the first challenge to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> since she took over the party's top post 14 years ago. The challenge comes at a time of sagging popularity for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s leadership. Opinion polls published Sunday showed the Conservatives trailing opposition Labor by as much as 14 points. However, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, who handed in his nomination papers Wednesday evening, said he had `` no idea'' how much support he would get. `` All I want to do is to give people the opportunity to vote,'' he told reporters. `` It is for them to make up their own minds.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ousted former Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> as party leader 14 years ago. The 64-year-old prime minister has led the Conservatives to three successive election victories since 1979. She is the longest-serving <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister this century. Nominations for the party leadership close at noon Thursday. The results of voting by the 375 Conservatives in the 650-member House of Commons are due to be announced Tuesday. Conservative lawmakers vote annually on their leader, but Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has been endorsed unopposed since defeating <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> in 1975. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> complained Monday that the challenge to her leadership was causing `` damaging'' uncertainty. Labor moved ahead of the Conservatives in the polls in the spring amid widespread dissatisfaction over rising inflation and intended changes in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. When <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, a 69-year-old former diplomat, announced his candidacy last week, he said he would withdraw if a more senior party member would run against Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. But none has come forward. Under party rules, the identities of <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>'s nominator and seconder are not disclosed. Under a complicated voting formula, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> needs 57 percent of the votes cast to win outright. If she fails, other candidates are expected to enter the race for a second ballot. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> opposes the sale of state-owned water utilities. He wants better pensions for war widows and believes Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> should be more enthusiastic about European economic integration.

<HEAD>Imelda Marcos Turned To Nancy Reagan For Legal Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soon after <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was deposed as <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> leader in 1986, his wife appealed to <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for White House intervention in their legal affairs, according to government documents made public Wednesday. In a `` Dearest Nancy'' letter dated Sept. 11, 1986, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> asked Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to help her avoid iving a deposition in a civil racketeering lawsuit brought in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> court by the Philippine government against the Marcoses. `` I understand that a ` suggestion' from the ` White House' or the ` State Depart.' could prevent these indignities to an ally and friend,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> wrote. Whether Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded is not known, but Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> later did give the deposition, invoking her Fifth Amendment rights. The Philippine case, which is still pending, seeks to recover money allegedly stolen from the Philippine government by the Marcoses for personal use. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that it was the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' `` long-standing practice not to comment on pending legal matters.'' The letter was contained in the government's response papers to numerous pretrial motions brought by Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyers in her pending criminal indictment. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has pleaded innocent to charges that she and her late husband siphoned nearly $ 200 million from the Philippine treasury and funneled it into this country for the purchase of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate and art. She is scheduled to go on trial in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s federal court March 14. The government papers also revealed that prosecutors investigated charges that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> embezzled $ 15 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government funds that had been designated for use by the Philippine government. The money, from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, allegedly was deposited into a Swiss bank account controlled by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> said Wednesday that the embezzlement allegations were not contained in the racketeering indictment brought against the Marcoses in October 1988. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' letter was included to undercut her contention that she and her husband were `` kidnapped'' from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government in February 1986 after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was ousted as leader. In the letter, Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> thanks the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> for their hospitality. <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>'s abduction allegation was `` an absurd claim ... She transforms history into fairy tale.'' `` <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> does not acknowledge that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government evacuated her amidst crowds of anti-Marcos demonstrators, but contends, instead that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government ousted her from power through force and deception,'' <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> said in his papers. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is seeking to have the charges against her dropped because of the abduction claim. The government papers also revealed that the <ORGANIZATION> Marcoses </ORGANIZATION> declined to provide any tax information to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government in 1986 and 1987 because they claimed they were brought to the country against their will. In addition to Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' letter, the prosecutor included a letter from <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, which had previously been made public. In that letter, dated June 9, 1988, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who died in September at the couple's home in exile in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, asks the president to block the criminal indictment against the Marcoses and then thanked the president for his hospitality over the last two years. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>'s letter, which was typewritten and addressed to `` Mr. President,'' was much more formal than Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>'s appeal to Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in which she describes the pain and humiliation of the couple's legal problems. `` I do n't think I have enough strength left to bear up with all these,'' she wrote. `` Therefore I ask your invaluable help to prevent a ` deposition' on me and with a clear conscience, I am optimistic of justice and your understanding.'' The letter was signed, `` Much, much love, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 The son of B-movie actress <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> was given a three-year suspended sentence and placed on probation Wednesday for the beating death of his mother. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> originally was charged with murder in the 1986 bludgeoning death of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON>, 59, who appeared in such 1950s films as `` Machine Gun Kelly'' with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> and `` Tomahawk'' with <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>. The sentencing of Roman ended an unusual pair of trials marked by testimony that Roman, born a dwarf, suffered brain damage from growth drugs and allegations Roman was the illegitimate son of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. Roman, 25, of <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION> was convicted last month of involuntary manslaughter in a second trial, conducted without a jury before <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Schempp </PERSON>. The first trial ended in a mistrial when Roman's attorney became ill. `` The case is a real tragic one It's hard to walk out and say you're happy with the result,'' said Roman's second attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. `` He loved his mother and ... is relieved in the knowledge he does n't have to go to jail and can get on and live his life.'' Miss <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON>'s body was found Dec. 10, 1986, after Roman called police to the dilapidated <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION> home they had shared. She had been beaten with a barbell. Roman initially told officers that he had been beaten unconscious by a man dressed as a Ninja warrior and awoke to find his mother dead. But in court he admitted he had fabricated the story and pleaded innocent by reason of insanity. In the second trial, <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> testified his mother's mental state had badly deteriorated and that she had initiated the violence by swinging the barbell at him. He said he did n't remember what had happened next. The involuntary manslaughter charge carried a maximum four-year prison term, but <PERSON> Schempp </PERSON> handed down the three-year prison term, which she then suspended. Roman's defense attorney in the first trial, <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, argued part of the insanity defense was based on side effects Roman suffered from experiments with drugs undertaken to boost his growth. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, in arguing his client was at risk in jail, said Roman might be the illegitimate son of King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and could have been a terrorist target. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> briefly dated King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in the 1950s.

 The ex-wife of convicted cocaine kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> was sentenced Wednesday to four years in prison for conspiracy to distribute cocaine in the so-called `` Son of Lehder'' case. <PERSON> Yemel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nacel </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was one of nine people who pleaded guilty in September before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> II. Five were sentenced Wednesday. `` I'm truly sorry for whatever involvement I had in the cocaine business,'' she told the judge. `` My marriage to <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was not as it may seem. I was trying to be a good wife and it mainly exposed me to most of what has happened.'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, the lead prosecutor, said Ms. <PERSON> Nacel </PERSON>, who faced up to 15 years imprisonment, had cooperated fully. He recommended a prison term of five years or less. `` I have no doubt that her original involvement with <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was due to romance and not other reasons, in fact I think she still has some love for the man,'' <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said. The case is called `` Son of Lehder'' because it grew out of a 7 -LCB- - month trial that resulted in <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 39, receiving a life sentence with no chance of parole He is being held in isolation at the maximum-security prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, Ill. In the agreement, Ms. <PERSON> Nacel </PERSON> pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine.

Ms. <PERSON> Nacel </PERSON> married <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> in 1977 in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. The couple divorced about three years later in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. Co-defendant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Moller </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION> was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $ 50,000 for possession with intent to distribute at least one kilogram of cocaine and one tax evasion charge from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Moller </PERSON>, who could have received 20 years, will remain incarcerated until he receives a prison assignment.

 A search for eight people missing aboard a twin-engine commuter plane that disappeared off <LOCATION> Block </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> the day before was called off Wednesday night, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` The results of the search indicated there were probably no survivors from the crash,'' said Petty Officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jersey </PERSON>, speaking from <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. All searchers found was debris and the bodies of two dogs aboard the aircraft. <PERSON> Jersey </PERSON> said the search was officially suspended at 9:38 p.m. and the eight aircraft and cutters were told to cease their efforts. <PERSON> Jersey </PERSON> said the search would not be resumed Thursday. While earlier in the day <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials expressed hope of finding survivors, veteran islanders said the seas of 5 to 6 feet and water temperatures of about 45 degrees made survival unlikely. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said the debris was found mainly in an area where the water averages 100 feet deep. Debris that was plucked from the water or washed ashore included a shoe, a fire extinguisher, a headset, life jackets, seat cushions and a box with a New England Airlines label, officials said. The two dogs were identified as belonging to passenger <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Friends said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fells </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, ran a sporting goods store with her husband on the island and had taken a later flight than her husband after closing the store for the season. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' attorney, said officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, would investigate.

 The 1989 National Book Award for fiction went to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> on Wednesday for `` Spartina,'' and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> won the non-fiction award for `` From <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>,'' his account of the battle-scarred <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Also Wednesday night, the second annual National Book Award for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters was presented to <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boorstin </PERSON>, Librarian of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emeritus </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 10,000 prize is awarded for lifelong contributions to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> letters which have had an extraordinary and permanent impact on American literature. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, in 1949 and educated at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and the University of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. He is a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, teaching English literature and creative writing, and also wrote `` Testimony and Demeanor'' and `` An American Romance.'' `` Spartina'' is a study of the ties that bind <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> _ a fisherman, father and lover _ to his wife, his mistress, his sons, his community and his boat. `` Thank goodness these five judges were in the mood, because that's what it is, they were in the mood for my book,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said at a news conference after the awards presentation. `` It's like a date when you read a book. Some of them go well, some of them do n't go well, so I just lucked out,'' he said. `` From <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'' is an account by <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reporter, of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict as seen from the two eponymous cities. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> in 1953 and educated at <LOCATION> Brandeis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> universities. Twice winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> for the Times, he is now the newspaper's chief diplomatic correspondent. `` I discovered I was quite at home in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> ... I was definitely more <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> than <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>'s suggestion that the surviving Beatles reunite is n't for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who says he does n't believe in yesterday. `` As far as I'm concerned, there wo n't be a Beatles reunion as long as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> remains dead,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said in a terse statement that seems to put the kibosh on reunion speculation. <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, the third surviving Beatle, could n't be reached through his manager's office.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> stars as the money man behind the turbulent development of a small <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert town into a gambling oasis in the Showtime miniseries `` The Neon Empire.'' The two-part drama traces efforts by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> gangster <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Moloff </PERSON> to turn <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> into a sophisticated mecca for gambling and prostitution in the 1940s. The first two-hour segment appears Sunday and the second part on Monday. <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> plays <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mobster <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Brower </PERSON>, a character based on <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON> is the volatile <PERSON> Moloff </PERSON>, based on <PERSON> Bugsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON> was a brilliant man who was consulted not only by gangsters but by businessmen as well,'' said <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>. `` He was able to see into the future. Lucky Luciano often would n't make a move without consulting <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON> saw it as a business. Drug traffic was something he wanted no part of. He was also against prostitution. He wanted to stop at gambling and booze. He was a man who could be trusted if you played by the rules. He could be very dangerous if you stepped outside the rules.'' `` The Neon Empire,'' written by journalist-novelist <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamill </PERSON>, also stars <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiorentino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Peerce </PERSON> directed on location in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. `` I play <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Brower </PERSON> rabbinically,'' said <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>. `` Like a rabbi, but a deadly one. He's a man you can talk to, do business with. Like <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON>, he's the man who ties the Jewish mobs and the Italian Mafia together. `` <PERSON> Bugsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> was a man who was emotionally wild. <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON> had to keep him under control. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> was later killed in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> worked on `` The Neon Empire'' in June and July, after completing work on <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s `` Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Next, he worked in `` By the Dawn's Early Light'' for Home Box Office. He also stars in `` Max and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>'' for TNT. He's probably best remembered as Rollin Hand, the master of disguise, in the TV series `` Mission: Impossible.'' His former wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bain </PERSON>, was <PERSON> Cinnamon </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. They later starred in the syndicated series `` Space: 1999.'' Many people believe that <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>'s role as Dr. <PERSON> Judah </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> in `` Crimes and Misdemeanors'' will bring him his second nomination for an Academy Award. He was nominated as best supporting actor last year for `` Tucker: The Man and His Dreams.'' `` My role is the biggest male protagonist <PERSON> Woody </PERSON>'s ever written outside of his own roles,'' he said. `` He usually writes his own role and a role for a female protagonist. I do n't want to say too much about my role. But what happens after people see it is fascinating. It resonates for days afterward. I've never been in a movie that affects people that powerfully.'' <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, studied art at the <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and at the age of 18 became assistant to cartoonist <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> in drawing `` The Gumps.'' He also illustrated <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s `` Pitching Horseshoes'' column. `` ` The Gumps' was the most popular comic strip in the country at one time,'' <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> said. `` I drew the lettering and the backgrounds for the daily strip. The Sunday strip had a separate story and I did the story and all the drawing, from conception to finish. You could create your own little world in cartooning. I could create little one-act plays.'' Nevertheless, <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> quit after winning an audition to the Actors Studio. The only other actor accepted at that time was <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON>. The role in `` Mission: Impossible'' was created for <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> by <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, a writer who had studied acting in a class taught by <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>. The character was originally called <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> thought that was too obvious and <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> changed it to <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hand </ORGANIZATION>, the name used in the pilot. `` Space: 1999'' came after the `` Star Trek'' series but before the `` Star Wars'' movies. <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> was one of the astronauts on Moon Base Alpha who were pushed into outer space when atomic waste stored on the moon went critical and acted as a propellant. As they passed through various solar systems the astronauts kept checking for a liveable planet, and were checked out in turn by curious otherworldly creatures. The show was created for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, but instead became a pioneer in first-run syndication. It inspired <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> to put `` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>'' into syndication. After that, <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> did not have a major film role until `` Tucker.'' `` I was working but I was doing mindless pictures,'' he said. `` I always believed a good role would come along. It did when <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON> cast me in ` <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>.''' Next, he will produce and play a role in the film adaptation of <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Vonnegut </PERSON>'s `` Breakfast of Champions.''

<HEAD>Environmentalists Pledge Fight Over Diamond Mining</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

 Tourists dream of instant wealth at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s only diamond-mining park. But companies with the same hopes for the Crater of Diamonds State Park have environmentalists worried. `` This land belongs to the public and should be preserved, not used to line somebody's pockets,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> attorney representing the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, part of a coalition of environmental groups threatening legal action to stop the potential exhaustion of a unique natural resource. Retiree <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> is a regular among the 700 visitors a day who sweat and swear on diamond digs for just a $ 3 admission ticket. <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, 64, shovels clumps of dirt into a wire-screened pan then dunks it vigorously in a large tub of water, allowing heavy material _ diamonds, he hopes _ to settle. Most of his pans turn up nothing and others produce diamonds the size of a pinhead. But for the discoverer even small stones carry the satisfaction of <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s finest. `` I do n't care if I find a big diamond,'' <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> said. `` I just want to keep a-digging.'' The largest diamond found at the park was a 40-carat, 33-point, light-pink stone unearthed in 1925 by miners and dubbed `` Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>.'' The largest found by a tourist was a 16-carat, 37-point, white stone dug up in 1975. The state has moved cautiously in its authorization of commercial core drilling on the 35-acre field in southwestern <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> in 1986 appointed a <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to study the idea of mining at the park, and the state <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> distributed paperwork to more than 50 companies or individuals who might be interested. `` It has forced us to ask a lot of questions about what we really want out of the only resource of its kind in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, the acting director of the <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` It also made us realize that we made some strategic mistakes at the park, because the crater is not very user-friendly.'' A 35-acre plowed field where people can look for diamonds is inaccessible to the handicapped and does n't have water fountains, restrooms or other amenities. The commission voted last month to work with four companies who will share the estimated $ 350,000 cost of initial studies plus the cost of any litigation. Test drilling could begin by April if the process is not delayed by a lawsuit by the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and the Friends of the Crater of Diamonds. `` This is something completely new in mineral exploration,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a consulting engineer who served as a state adviser. `` You have four companies cooperating with the state to conduct tests in the most effective manner. Normally, they would be slitting each other's throats.'' Should the state decide to allow mining, only the companies paying for the initial studies will be allowed to seek digging rights, <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said. `` I think a lot of these companies are used to spending money on a gamble.'' Environmentalists who attended an earlier commission meeting at which preliminary core drilling was approved say even those tests could mean diamonds are n't forever at the park. `` We see this as a foot-in-the-door type thing. If they get the test drilling in there, it defeats the principle of inviolacy of park lands,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> attorney. `` It's a lose-lose situation. If the results come back and they say there are lots of diamonds there may be incredible pressure to open it to commercial mining. If they come back and say it's a dry hole, then much of the mystique of the park may disappear. `` We prefer to leave a little bit of the aura of mystery out there.'' To allow tests, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had to grant a `` temporary non-recreational use'' of the diamond field. `` This is a political decision,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>, coordinator of Friends of Crater of Diamonds State Park. Past drilling has shown that the diamond-bearing ore goes down at least 205 feet. Six to 10 feet of earth have been scraped away in 50 years, so the park could last centuries, said Superintendent <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>. No projections have a commercial site in production past about 50 years, he said. Cannon, 39, does n't like to talk politics, but he does like to brag about the crater, where he has been in charge since 1973. `` Personally, I'm cautious about any major changes in the park that would have a major impact, and this certainly would have a major impact,'' he said of testing. Attempts for more than a century to commercially mine diamonds at the site have flopped, he said, because of a lack of experience or capital. The mine was idle when the state acquired it for $ 750,000 in 1972. Bad luck and bad feelings also figured in past failures, <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said. One father-son team found itself facing 36 lawsuits after a year in operation and their mining plant was gone after three mysterious fires in one night. The four companies that will take part in the studies are <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diamonds </ORGANIZATION>, 51 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> Galactic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Sunshine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Exdiam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, both of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Rhombus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>; Capricorn Diamonds of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Kennecott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Such companies may offer improved technology and big backing, according to Cannon. Even so, they're gambling _ just like the hopeful tourists who slog through the often muddy field bearing shovels and pans. `` It's a combination of curiosity and quick riches. Gambling _ an idea of buying a $ 3 ticket and perhaps finding something of untold worth.''

 Trade negotiators have haggled over cars, clothes, phones, skis, electrical switches, oranges, beef, semiconductors, supercomputers, wood _ you name it _ trying to shrink the stubborn <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. After more than 20 years of pressure and persuasion, and some recent improvement in the trade balance, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is zeroing in on what many experts say has been the issue all along: Real progress depends on changing the way the Japanese do business. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s systems for buying and distributing goods are the biggest obstacle facing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers who export or do business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> R.K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, director of international trade policy for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, recently told a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. With <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> accounting for 40 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit last year, the imbalance has n't fallen as far as it should have given the weakening of the dollar against the yen, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. Behind the arcane trade rules once used to keep imports out lies an even more formidable challenge _ `` keiretsu,'' or networks of financial and personal ties that bind Japanese subcontractor to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer, in almost impenetrable alliances. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials expressed disappointment after talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in November at which Japanese officials said they would `` advise'' firms to end practices keeping foreign companies out of their market, but warned that quick change was unlikely. `` There was very little flexibility in the Japanese government position ... in reaching common ground on the nature of the problems, even problems which appear to be widely recognized in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallara </PERSON> said after the talks. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s insular, exclusive business culture and the lifestyle and tastes of its discriminating consumers lie outside government jurisdiction. In most cases, but certainly not all, a foreigner hoping to sell to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> no longer faces obvious legal barriers, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. Quotas and excessive duties on alcohol, beef, citrus and many other products have been negotiated out of existence. Vociferous complaints and lengthy trade talks also have helped to end the strange restrictions like those that once judged foreign-made skis `` unsuitable'' for Japanese snow. Instead, foreign and Japanese businessmen trying to sell new products here face alliances of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s most powerful firms _ led by <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION>, Fuyo -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <LOCATION> Sanwa </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dai-Ichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> _ each with its own banks, retailers and real estate, insurance and manufacturing companies. These are the `` keiretsu,'' and there are some 30 smaller ones as well. Through interlocking holdings, they own more than 70 percent of shares on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s stock markets. Cartels by any other name, the keiretsu enable competing manufacturers to fix prices and divide markets among themselves _ activities that would be illegal under antitrust laws in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but provoke only mild government warnings here. According to a study by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, almost 48 percent of home electronics in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are sold through exclusively affiliated stores and 99 percent of cars are distributed through exclusive dealerships. The keiretsu are looser versions of the industrial combines, or `` zaibatsu,'' of wartime <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s commercial armies are the nation's economic defense. Only Japanese products carry the guarantee of being returned to the wholesaler if they do n't sell. Imports do n't. Through such arrangements, Japanese manufacturers keep 1.6 million retailers in business. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with 25 times the area and twice the population, has only 1.4 million. The Japanese retailer survives this inefficiency by charging the world's highest prices. A recent survey by the Japanese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governments found 84 of 122 items priced in both countries were excessively expensive in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, including food, wine, cosmetics, bed linens, golf clubs and spark plugs. Americans, in contrast, paid more for ketchup, perfume, table china, household batteries and Japanese-made electronics goods. Some people think Sonys and Panasonics are cheaper in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but the surveyors did find bargains at discount stores in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Surprisingly, pressure for change has come not from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s long-suffering consumers but from foreigners and other `` outsiders'' _ new Japanese entrants into established markets Large-scale retailers are fighting the regulations that limit their expansion to protect small stores. Industrialists are calling for opening <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s farm markets. Even some rice farmers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s most productive areas, confident of their ability to compete, have begun to rail against government restrictions Supporters of change have found a willing but quiet ally in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s anti-monopoly watchdog, the <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which has long done little but issue warnings to violators of antitrust laws. In recent months, the <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has fined contractors involved in a price cartel, investigated price gaps between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other countries, and issued warnings to computer manufacturers that bid one yen _ less than a penny _ to win contracts from local governments. The commission last year recommended steps to encourage more supermarkets and department stores, which tend to import more than mom and pop shops. It said they should be allowed to have more floor space and stay open past 7 p.m., the normal closing time. The panel recommended deregulating sales of alcohol and lifting other government controls that limit competition and drive up prices in the airline, banking, insurance and transport industries. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say a myriad of restrictions, most not apparent until they are violated by foreign exporters, exist at all levels of the Japanese economy. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> faces possible retaliation under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Super 301 trade bill for tariffs and housing standards that limit imports of wood products and for government procurement policies that limit purchases of U.S.-made supercomputers and satellites. Recent trade figures indicate foreign firms are making inroads here, despite the odds. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s prices mean high profits for those importers who manage to crack the barriers, and more are acquiring the expertise to do so. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> remains high: it is expected to be about $ 50 billion this year, compared to $ 55 billion in 1988 and almost $ 60 billion in the peak year of 1987, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters are trying harder. American exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> so far this year are up almost 19 percent. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is importing more finished, higher-value products that can make a bigger dent in the surplus than cheap raw materials. In 1980, only 22 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s imports were finished products. In 1988, almost half were, according to <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> figures. Despite high costs, language and cultural barriers and difficulties in recruiting top employees, many foreign companies have done very well in the Japanese market. <PERSON> Schick </PERSON> razors, <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> instant coffee, <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>'s corn flakes, Lux soap, Contac cold medicine, Pampers disposable diapers, Snickers candy, Kleenex and other foreign brands, through trial and error, have won hard-earned places on Japanese store shelves.

 Breaking into the lucrative Japanese market is n't impossible, but it is n't easy, either Consider Snickers. For <ORGANIZATION> Mars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, putting Snickers, <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> bars and M & amp; M's within reach of Japanese consumers required `` a mind-boggling expenditure of time and money,'' said <PERSON> Kiyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ide </PERSON>, senior managing director of Mars' Japanese subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Master </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> KK </ORGANIZATION>. The breakthrough also required an alliance with one of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s giant trading companies Mars leaped over <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s formidable barriers by using <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s extensive contacts to place its candy bars at subway kiosks and in grocery stores. Mars began selling candy in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1987. While the company wo n't divulge sales figures, it said surveys show Snickers' share of the chocolate bar market is growing, from its small base, faster than that of any other brand. Foreign companies attempting to sell in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have to hurdle government barriers _ including murky rules and regulations, import duties, fair trade price laws that limit sales promotion activities, and complex import procedures. But the maze-like distribution system _ rigidly controlled by wholesalers _ is a particular hindrance to importers because it typically increases prices up to four times after Japanese distributors add on their markups. For `` status'' products, the climb is even steeper. The wholesale price of a bottle of <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON>'s VSOP cognac is $ 7, but by the time it hits store shelves it is $ 77.50. Consider the imported necktie: $ 28 to the import agent, who sells it to a wholesaler for $ 56, who sells it to a department store for $ 70, which displays it beautifully and gets $ 112 from the customer. The distribution system is under scrutiny by Japanese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade negotiators in talks on the two nations' structural barriers to trade. Simply finding someone to distribute new products in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> often is impossible because of exclusive, longstanding relationships between wholesalers and retailers. Sole import agents, although easier to find, limit a product's sales. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the American direct-sales company, is doing a booming business here. Its secret? It imported its own distribution system. The company offers household items, toiletries and cookware through its network of 500,000 Japanese distributors who sell through personal contacts from their homes. A phone call to one of <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s three modern distribution centers will produce an item within 72 hours, says <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Scacco </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> is the fastest-growing foreign company in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, according to a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, with sales of more than half a billion dollars last year. <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> boosted its Japanese sales 38 percent last year, working through the equally upscale <ORGANIZATION> Mitsukoshi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> as its sole distributor. Blue Diamond Growers, sellers of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> almonds, broke into the market after 15 years by piggybacking onto Coca-Cola <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s independent distributors, which deal with 1.2 million outlets BMW got around the astronomical price of land for car lots by seeking out people who owned land where dealerships could be set up, then training the landowners to be dealers. Riding a consumption binge, the West German automaker is approaching its target of 1 percent of the car market. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> executives in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> concluded in a recent study that new companies, whether foreign or domestic, are the targets of a kind of in-bred discrimination. `` Even a Japanese company with a new product has trouble penetrating the Japanese distribution system,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Best </PERSON> of the management consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> A.T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kearney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, who headed the study by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Because the Japanese put so much stock in powerful companies with famous names, wholesalers and retailers are uncomfortable with fledgling enterprises. `` Without name recognition, it is very difficult to get wholesalers to accept your products into the distribution system and to get retailers to put them on the shelves,'' <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said. `` Just because you're unknown, you wo n't get the kind of opportunity you would get in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> market.'' <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and Japanese leaders face an uphill battle in trying to change the way people think about business relationships. `` These attitudes ca n't be legislated away,'' Best says. But some changes loom. Recent trends include retailers importing directly from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suppliers, and `` development imports.'' Development imports _ custom products for which materials, quality levels, design and processing methods are specified by Japanese companies that then import the finished products into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ are among supermarket chain <ORGANIZATION> Jusco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s most common type of import, says <PERSON> Chikashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Honma </PERSON>, general manager of the international merchandising division at <ORGANIZATION> Jusco </ORGANIZATION> Issetan, an elegant department store, is also creating private-label products this way. Analysts say this trend will continue because the goods can be sold cheaper than domestic products. `` There are a number of new channels and smart <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businessmen will do the market research to find the right distribution network,'' says one analyst.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, after improving for six months, deteriorated slightly to $ 27.75 billion in the third quarter, fed by the nation's appetite for imported goods and by flat exports, the government said. Analysts do not see much improvement in the near future. Imports may drop somewhat because of a slowing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, they said Tuesday, but exports also are likely to fall because of a strong dollar and moderating economies overseas. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gap between imports and exports edged up 0.7 percent in the July-September quarter from the second quarter's $ 27.55 billion.

<HEAD>Conference Board: Small Labor Pool Big Problem Facing U.S. Companies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A shrinking labor pool will be the biggest problem confronting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses in the coming year, according to a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The business-research group said Tuesday its Human Resources Outlook Panel, comprising 10 corporate executives and labor analysts, predicted that many companies, faced with a continuing labor shortage, will be forced to hire workers they would not have hired in the past, such as unskilled workers. `` The old days of creaming the country's labor pool for the very best candidates are over,'' said <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, management counsellor at the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` Companies will be increasingly seeking ways to bring people in rather than screening them out of jobs in the coming decade.'' The job pool has become smaller as more people are employed and fewer are looking for work. Women and immigrants are expected to be the largest group of new job candidates in the 1990s, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said. Many large firms have begun seeking employees from foreign countries and are devoting more time and money toward recruiting, training and retraining workers, the business-supported research organization said. The Conference Board panel, which meets annual to issue its labor and economic forecast, said the economy would again escape a recession in 1990. It projected that the unemployment rate would average 5.3 percent next year, little changed from its recent levels. Wages would rise an average 5 percent in 1990 and that inflation will average 4.5 percent, also near its current levels, the panel said.

<TEXT>
 The ceiling on the size of single-family home loans purchased by the nation's secondary mortgage-market agencies is declining by $ 150 to $ 187,450 next year, the first drop in at least a decade, the government said. Lenders usually charge interest rates a quarter - to a half-percentage point lower on mortgages they sell on the secondary market, compared with loans that exceed the limit The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- announced the drop Tuesday in its limit based on October data collected by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which said the average home purchase price was $ 136,800 in the month, down from $ 136,900 a year earlier. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- followed with a later announcement saying it too was dropping its ceiling for single-family homes to $ 187,450, effective with mortgage contracts signed after Jan. 1. Together, the two congressionally chartered but publicly owned agencies help finance nearly one in four of the nation's residential mortgages They purchase mortgages from lenders and repackage them into bond-like securities for investors. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, senior vice president at the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, said the agencies should have used their discretion and left the ceiling unchanged. The slight drop will affect few homebuyers but he complained it sets a bad precedent and will prove somewhat disruptive for lenders. According to <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>, mortgages purchased in the first nine months of this year averaged $ 83,000. Only 5 percent exceeded $ 168,700, the previous year's limit. In the past few years, rapid increases in the ceiling have helped buyers in high-priced markets obtain a lower interest rate. This year, home prices have cooled in expensive <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> markets, but they continue to climb at double-digit rates in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The ceiling was $ 115,000 in 1985, $ 133,250 in 1986, $ 153,100 in 1987, $ 168,700 in 1988 and $ 187,600 in 1989. The 1990 decline in the index `` certainly indicates that home prices have flattened out a little bit. It probably is a reasonably accurate reflection of what's happened in the real estate market,'' <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON> said. It is the first decline since the index was established in 1980.

<HEAD>Group Recommends Replacing Stock Certificates With Electronic Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock certificates should be replaced by electronic records of stock ownership to speed up the process of trading securities, according to experts on financial markets. Greater use of computerized record keeping for securities transactions is part of a plan to shorten the period for settling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate securities trades to three business days from the current five. The plan stems from recommendations to reduce settlement periods worldwide made earlier this year by the Group of Thirty, a private international research organization. The London-based group's recommendations were `` aimed at improving and harmonizing clearance and settlement systems in the world's securities markets to reduce risks and transaction costs as well as increase liquidity and efficiency.'' The Group of Thirty's recommendations were evaluated by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> study committee, which prepared a report. A summary of the report was released Tuesday. Copies are being distributed to executives at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment firms and banks. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> study committee urged an `` extensive educational effort'' by industry trade groups and securities firms to accustom investors to do without certificates and accept an electronic book entry system. The committee expects the conversion could be accomplished by 1992. Under the plan, once the new system is in place existing certificates would be withdrawn from circulation when stocks are sold and reissued as book entries. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities and mutual funds already are sold to retail investors in book-entry form. About a third of all newly issued municipal bonds are sold as book entries and some corporate bonds are also. The study committee said the switch to a book-entry system could entail sweeping changes in securities firms' back-office operations and might require legislation to be put into effect. But the committee concluded that `` the cost savings would far outweigh the expense of implementation.'' Cost cuts would be welcome during the current slump in securities trading activity and industry profitability, the committee said in its report.

 Contracting for new construction fell 6 percent in October as contracts for highway and bridge building declined sharply, according to a survey. New contracts fell 6 percent in October to an annual rate of $ 262.6 billion, said the survey released Tuesday by the F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Its seasonally adjusted Dodge Index dipped to 167 in October from 178 in September The October decline set back construction contracting to the level that has prevailed for most of the past two years, the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said. `` October's return to the 1988-89 ` plateau' of contracting shows that the basics have n't changed much,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, vice president and chief economist for the consulting group. `` Commercial overbuilding and public austerity are conditions that the construction industry must endure while waiting for lower interest rates to revive the housing market,'' he said. While contracting for highway and bridge construction fell sharply in October and nonresidential building also declined, homebuilding activity was stable, the report said. Residential building held steady at $ 121.5 billion as hotel and motel contracting gained, multi-family projects declined and single-family homebuilding was steady.

 Thrift regulator <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> does not plan to heed the latest call for his resignation, his spokesman said. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, called for Wall's departure Monday but said he might not be to blame for the problems of the savings and loan industry. Wall declined to respond to <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s statement but his spokesman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulwider </PERSON>, said Tuesday the senator's complaint `` is hardly grounds for asking for his resignation.'' `` He has no plans to resign,'' <PERSON> Fulwider </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, the leaders of three advocacy groups said they will demand today that Wall quit. They are <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, a group founded by consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, president of Citizens Against Government Waste. They will be joined by <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, analyst frequently at odds with Wall over estimates of the S & amp; L industry's losses Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has written to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggesting that Wall step aside. The president's response has been less than warm support. `` If part of the savings and loan problem proves to be management or regulation people that are n't aggressive enough, the answer will be yes,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said when asked about <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' letter. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' committee has been investigating the collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, expected to become the nation's largest S & amp; L failure at a cost to taxpayers of $ 2 billion. The panel charges that Wall ignored a recommendation to seize <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and stem its losses two years before the thrift was taken over. Wall maintains that there was insufficient evidence to legally take that action. Nevertheless, pressure has been building for him to quit. The Wall Street Journal called for his resignation in an editorial this week. And, according to industry sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> advisers led by counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> are pushing for Wall's ouster. However, an administration source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said Wall enjoys some support within the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which counts on his vote on the five-member board governing the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an independent agency which insures bank and S & amp; L deposits. Under S & amp; L legislation passed in August, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s term extends until July 1, 1991.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> says he has no plans for further attempts to buy an interest in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> but said his company still wants to become the first `` truly global airline.'' British Airways Chairman Lord <PERSON> King </PERSON> said Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> should merge into one trading bloc, beginning with open skies for airlines on both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. King criticized two bills in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would give <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> increased power to stop foreign control of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> also opposes the legislation, saying he already has enough power to limit foreign involvement in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation. King, speaking on the eve of British-U.S. talks over the possible revision of bilateral air service agreements, said that despite his call for open skies, he wo n't advocate any further opening of routes or investments to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> without reciprocal benefits. `` I am not advocating and will not practice unilateral commercial disarmament,'' King told a group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British business executives. Asked after the speech if he still had an interest in buying into <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, after a deal for an employee-management buyout of the airline fell through, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said: `` Not in the foreseeable future.'' <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> would have gained a 15 percent interest in the new <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said, however, that <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> would continue to `` widen and deepen'' its marketing agreements with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and possibly make similar agreements with other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. `` We shall continue to pursue our ambition to be the first truely global airline,'' he said. King said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> deal, which failed to get the needed financing, was skewed `` by the need to restrict the level of -LRB- foreign -RRB- participation to what would be acceptable to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. government.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law allows no more than 25 percent foreign interest in the voting stock of an American carrier. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said that even though 27 percent of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> is owned by Americans, it likely would not have been allowed to acquire more than 15 percent of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline. He noted that <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> forced a reduction of <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> interest in the takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent company, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said he would continue to encourage his government to resist <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers' efforts to gain additional services to <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> cities unless <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> is allowed to serve more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities `` Disparity in market strength has enabled the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to trade limited access to the American market for larger access to the European,'' he said. But after 1992, when 12 European markets unite, conditions will change, he said. `` Do not expect the nations of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to continue to accept such an unequal state of affairs,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> states are expected to open all of their routes to all airlines within the European community, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could be part of the community. But he added, `` If <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is to be open to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must be opened to European airlines.''

 The value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports is expected to decline in 1990 after reaching an eight-year peak in 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Shipment value rose to $ 39.7 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the most since the record of $ 43.8 billion in 1981. For 1990, the department said Tuesday, exports may drop to $ 38 billion. The actual quantity of shipments also is down, totaling 147.8 million metric tons -LRB- 162.9 million short tons -RRB- in the last fiscal year. In 1990, those may drop to 145.5 million metric tons -LRB- 160.4 million short tons -RRB-. `` Lower prices for most grains and oilseeds largely account for what is expected to be the first decrease in export value since fiscal 1986,'' the report said. Export volume will be down mostly because of a substantial decline in wheat exports, which will be partly offset by larger shipments of corn, soybeans, cotton and high-value products.

<TEXT>
 A new magazine on science and health topics geared toward people over age 50 is planned for next spring from <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the publisher of such magazines as Discover and Health. Family Media says the digest-sized magazine will be called Breakthroughs in Health and Science. It plans to publish the magazine every other month with a circulation projected at 400,000. Meanwhile, the editor-in-chief of Health, <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Partie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, said Tuesday she has resigned as a result of a series of recent changes affecting her magazine. Among the changes are a planned 27 percent reduction in Health's circulation rate base, cutting the frequency of publication to 10 times a year from 12 and the appointment of two editorial directors to oversee <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>'s 11 magazines Ms. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said she had not been consulted in advance about the moves. `` The magazine I was recruited to produce is not the magazine the company wants to continue with,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said. She had been editor since April 1988. Breakthroughs is being designed to appeal to older consumers interested in `` noteworthy advances in health, medicine, psychology and other sciences,'' the company said. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, group president of <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that advertisers are starting to realize the potential of the growing group of older consumers although few have begun spending much to reach them. He said the launch of Breakthroughs should put <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> in a position to benefit over the next few years as appreciation for the market builds. A number of publishers have shown an interest in developing magazines for older readers or giving advertisers a chance to buy space only in issues of their magazines that go to older subscribers. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said Science Digest, with a circulation of 250,000, would be folded into Breakthroughs. Older subscribers to Health would be encouraged to switch to Breakthroughs as well. The last issue of Science Digest probably will be published in March with Breakthroughs starting in May, <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. Health will continue to feature stories on food, nutrition, fitness, medicine, fashion and beauty, targeting younger women, he said. But <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> said that because Health will be aimed at a younger readership, its rate base will be cut to 800,000 in February 1990 from 1.1 million. The decision to publish Health and another monthly, Savvy Woman, only 10 times a year brings them in line with five other <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> magazines _ Golf Illustrated, Homeowner, Model, Taxi and Your Family, which <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> previously disclosed would be launched in January in doctor's waiting rooms. Family Media also named two editorial directors for its magazines. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, 33, editor of Discover, will serve as editorial director of of 1001 Home Ideas, Health, Homeowner and Breakthroughs. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Amdur </PERSON>, 49, editor of World Tennis, will be editorial director for Golf Illustrated, Savvy Woman, Taxi, Model and Your Family. Ms. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said her decision to resign was `` the culmination'' of those and other recent decisions by Family Media management. `` When I was recruited, I was told this was to be serious contender in health marketplace,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said. She said her editorial staff produced such a magazine, but that <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> appeared unwilling to spend enough on promotion and distribution. Ms. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, 44, said she is `` exploring possibilities'' in the wake of Monday's abrupt resignation. She was an editorial executive at Self magazine for nine years before taking the top editorial post at Health.

<HEAD>Unable To Buy Record Label, Disney To Launch Its Own</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Unable to buy a record company at a price it considers reasonable, <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it will launch its own label, tentatively titled <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, that will include rock' n' roll, movie soundtracks and other pop formats. The Disney label will start up early next year, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The company will be headed by music attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Paterno </PERSON>, who will be joined in running the enterprise by <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bone </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysalis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are not joining the shark frenzy of media acquisitions,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said in a telephone interview. `` We are going to try to create from the ground up our own properties. `` The investment is not big enough that it puts the pressure on us to have the biggest and the best right away,'' <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said. `` We're going to go slow.'' He said the move was prompted in part by the booming international demand for recorded music. `` The recorded music business is a bigger business than the movie business, or the theme-park business or the television business,'' <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said, referring to the other areas in which Disney operates. While declining to reveal <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s initial investment in the record arm, <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said the costs were `` infinitesimal,'' less than the average $ 17 million cost of a motion picture. Disney already has a children's record label, <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, that it calls the largest children's music company in the world. The label will operate independently of the new record division, <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> said. Disney shares closed at $ 130 Tuesday in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, down 87 -LCB- cents. <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said he was not concerned that the sometimes-controversial nature of rock' n' roll music could tarnish <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s well-honed family image. `` This is no more a Disney label than -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Touchstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> is a Disney picture,'' <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said. `` This is owned by our same shareholders ... -LRB- but -RRB- this record division is separate and completely separated from <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, and would therefore have no effect on anything at <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>.'' As an attorney, <PERSON> Paterno </PERSON> has represented such heavy-metal artists as Guns' N Roses and <ORGANIZATION> Metallica </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you're going to be in the record business, you've got to have some controversy,'' <PERSON> Paterno </PERSON> said earlier this month, when rumors of <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>' launch circulated. `` Even the ` clean' artists like <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> are very controversial. <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said the Disney label would not follow the pattern of some recently launched record labels of signing top-dollar acts to establish a presence and prove to the industry that the label means business. `` It's going to be the opposite of that,'' <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said. `` Our concept is _ as our concept has been in the movie business and the television business _ to find new, exciting talent that becomes your own.'' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, an entertainment industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the label could become a significant revenue center for Disney over time. `` They long wanted a music division, and they've looked at many different possibilities from the standpoint of acquisition _ just about everybody who was up for sale in the last five years,'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said. `` But they've apparently decided that it was too expensive to buy, so they've decided to build,'' he said. `` Over the long term, -LRB- profits -RRB- could be significant. But clearly in the next year or two it wo n't amount to much.''

 A <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, company will get $ 12 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to help it build a computer that would be 1,000 times faster than today's most advanced computers. <ORGANIZATION> Thinking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the new computer would be capable of conducting 1 trillion mathematical operations per second, the company said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The grant will come from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which has been awarding grants aimed at keeping the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the world leader in high-speed computing. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, co-founder and chief scientist of <ORGANIZATION> Thinking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in today's editions that the company hopes to have a model with one-tenth the capacity of the final model ready in 1992.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of the British luxury car maker <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> wo n't be opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which made headlines by trimming its prime lending rate three weeks ago, has quietly raised the rate back to 10.5 percent from 10 percent. Southwest had stood alone in lowering the key interest rate, which reflects a bank's cost of borrowing money and is used in calculating business and consumer loans. The bank, which raised its prime on Tuesday, said it reversed its earlier decision due to recent moves by the the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to keep interest rates firm. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, performing a quick about-face, had drained money from the nation's banking system on Monday, driving the so-called federal funds rate upward. The fed funds rate is the interest on overnight loans between banks and is closely watched as an indicator of the central bank's policy on interest rates. `` It looks like the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> does n't intend to move the rate lower,'' said I.A. Long, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman-emeritus, who has made his reputation by repeatedly being the first banker in the country to cut the prime.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s latest production deal should help slow a decline in oil prices in the first half of 1990 by partially succeeding in reducing cheating on quotas by the cartel's 13 members, analysts say. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' oil ministers on Tuesday signed a pact under which their daily production ceiling will rise to 22 million barrels from 20.5 million barrels in the current quarter. The group's $ 18-a-barrel target price becomes a `` minimum reference price.'' The producers' output is actually up to 23.5 million barrels a day, and the new accord should bring it down to some 22.8 million barrels a day, analysts say. That means prices for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Brent Blend, for example, likely will drop to $ 17 a barrel instead of to $ 16 a barrel, in the spring, when demand for oil usually slackens, analysts say. The spot price of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, was $ 18.15 a barrel Wednesday morning, down from $ 18.30 a barrel late Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s price of crude oil stood at $ 17.74 a barrel, said the cartel's secretary-general, <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>. `` We feel that if it deviates too much from the minimum reference price, then we will meet,'' <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> told a news conference. In the meantime, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s eight-member monitoring committee plans to meet in March `` in order to assess the market,'' the ministers said in a communique. Leading oil ministers were upeat about the pact. <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s influential oil minister, told reporters that prices `` will steadily go up after the market ascertains the durability of the agreement. There is more discipline now, there is more commitment to the quota and the production ceiling.'' The deal should cut production by up to 1.3 million barrels a day, he said. <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, an oil analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed: `` It looks better than most people thought was possible.'' The ministers came up with a partial solution to demands from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> for bigger portions of the production. The two have been producing about double their current quotas. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> agreed Tuesday to a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day, up from its previous quota of 1.15 million barrels a day, but below its current output of 2 million barrels a day. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> officially agreed to a steady daily quota of 1.095 million barrels. But <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> oil minister <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> said his country got behind-the-scenes clearance from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to produce 2 million barrels a day. That would be less than the country's current output, which <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> pegged at 2.6 million barrels a day <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> also warned that the U.A.E.'s output would surpass 2 million barrels a day if there were excesses by other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members. `` Agreement and understanding was reached with the oil ministers to allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> to produce 2 million barrels daily,'' <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> was quoted as saying by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhabi </PERSON>'s official news agency <ORGANIZATION> WAM </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s overall producion still will be well above the expected demand of 21.5 million barrels.

 <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced today a corporate realignment and management reshuffle that included the reassignment of company president <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> to a lesser position. The move reflected the continuing turmoil at the nation's second-largest investment firm, which over the past month announced layoffs of hundreds of workers and a sharp reduction in stockbroker commissions <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement today that the company was dividing its businesses into four groups: Capital Markets, Investment and <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION>, Private Client and Subsidiary Activities. Other big Wall Street firms have made similar realignments in recent years. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> was reassigned to head the <ORGANIZATION> Subsidiary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which will include <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s money management businesses including its <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> division, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuld </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who currently heads <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s taxable fixed-income division, was seen as replacing <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> as <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s second-in-command, although <PERSON> Fuld </PERSON> was not given the title of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s president <PERSON> Fuld </PERSON> was named president of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which will include the company's worldwide capital markets activities. He will also oversee <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s administrative side. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, which is 61 percent-owned by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, also announced it was disbanding its chief policy-making committee, the 11-member policy group, but was creating a business development committee to `` help identify future directions for the firm.'' Today's announcement was expected. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said earlier this month that it was in the process of reshuffling its businesses. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> also said it would cut broker commissions by 1 percent to 2 percent in 1990, and on Nov. 7, it said it had begun laying off employees in a cutback that could total 2 percent by the end of the year. Analysts have said the changes at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> stem from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>' desire to reduce its stake in the investment firm, but wants <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> to first improve its profitability. The company is also trying to stave off a possible lowering of its credit rating by <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. In the third quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 66 million, but most of that came from a one-time $ 77 million pretax gain from the sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and investment banking fees from the merger of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> also announced today that the Investment and <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> will be headed by <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and that <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> will serve as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Client </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which is <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s brokerage operations <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> will also oversee <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s human resources department, the company said.

 A federal grand jury convened today to investigate a <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> engineer's allegations of improper inspections of shuttle parts since the Challenger disaster. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said he could not comment on the probe or any other matter the grand jury, holding its regular session, might look into. He said he expects the panel to complete its work by Friday. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, a spokesman for Utah-based <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday the company was asked to provide information about instrumentation in the redesigned rocket motors that were used beginning with the Discovery flight on Sept. 30, 1988. A quality control engineer for <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Joos </PERSON>, said Tuesday he wrote a memo to his superiors citing improper inspection procedures in some equipment used on shuttle missions. <PERSON> Joos </PERSON>, who has been subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury, said his superiors forwarded the memo <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. He said Challenger and the three subsequent shuttles may have operated with inaccurate equipment because of improper inspections. He said up to 50 percent of the data measured on shuttle flights may be inaccurate _ which means `` we could lose another shuttle today.'' <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, manager of the solid rocket booster program at <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, said the grand jury probe probably would be confined to the first three shuttle flights after the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion. Several hundred changes were made to the shuttle solid rocket boosters after the Challenger exploded. One of the major parts of the booster that was redesigned was the field joint blamed in the Challenger accident. The joints are formed when the huge booster segments are stacked at the Kennedy Space Center in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Cold launch temperatures prevented O-rings from sealing the joints, allowing gas to escape. A <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, said Tuesday night that the government `` has requested <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> to provide additional information relating to the redesigned solid rocket motors used in the space shuttle program. `` The information deals with instrumentation used on the first three flights using the redesigned solid rocket motors -LRB- post-Challenger flights. -RRB- The instrumentation and the motors on which it was used were flown successfully and fulfilled <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s mission requirements. <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said he did not know who requested the information and said he was not familiar with <PERSON> Joos </PERSON>. `` We know as little about it as you do at the moment,'' he said. `` This was all the information we were able to gather this afternoon.''

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at a moderate annual rate of 2.7 percent from July through September, the government reported today, but analysts say growth is slowing in the current quarter. The increase reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the broadest measure of economic health was up from an advance estimate of 2.5 percent issued last month. The revision was about in line with economists' expectations, but it could still cause the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to move more cautiously in its campaign to lower interest rates as a stimulant to growth. Most of the revision was attributed to a better-than-anticipated trade performance. The September trade deficit, which hit a five-year low, was unavailable when the advance estimate was made. Exports climbed at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of no change, while imports grew only 9.5 percent, compared with a 15.1 percent jump in last month's report. Consumer spending was also better than first thought, rising a brisk annual rate of 6.2 percent _ the strongest since the first quarter of 1988 _ compared with a preliminary estimate of 5.8 percent. Inflation, as measured by a price index tied to the GNP, improved dramatically in the third quarter, climbing at an annual rate of 2.9 percent after a 5.0 percent jump in the April-June quarter. Those figures were unchanged from the advance estimate. The GNP grew at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the second quarter and for the first nine months of the year is averaging a 3.0 percent annual rate, just above the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's forecast for the whole year At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We always like to see increase in growth. And this report is relatively good news in that sense.'' Still, many analysts believe the economy will have a tough time meeting the target because of a dramatic slowing in the current three-month period. A few predict the country will topple into a recession, ending the seven-year economic expansion that is unprecedented in peacetime. It would take only a 1.8 percent GNP increase in the October-December quarter to match the administration forecast, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst, but most private economists expect a growth rate of 1.5 percent or lower. `` My view is we can stay out of a recession, but just barely,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In a separate report today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said after-tax corporate profits were off a sharp 7.2 percent in the third quarter, matching the decline in the second quarter, which was the worst performance in three years. The decline marks the third consecutive quarter that profits have dropped. But, the department attributed $ 11 billion of the $ 15.5 billion decline to losses from Hurricane Hugo. Benefits paid by insurance companies totaled $ 9 billion, while uninsured corporate losses totaled $ 2 billion. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said corporate profits will continue to be weak. With the economy softening, companies are finding it difficult to pass on rising labor costs to their customers, he said. Analysts generally do not expect the third-quarter surge in consumer spending will be repeated, attributing much of it to auto purchases spurred by dealer discounts and financing incentives. They also are pessimistic about trade, believing that the strength in the dollar will stall improvement in the deficit. However, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, said Tuesday that falling interest rates should sustain economic growth into next year. `` Some private forecasters believe the economy will slow. ... But even the most pessimistic forecaster does not see a serious downturn in the economy,'' <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> told a conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in June reversed its program of fighting inflation with rising interest rates, but has lowered rates only gradually since then. It last eased credit early this month, nudging the rate charged among banks for overnight loans down a quarter-point to 8.5 percent. Many analysts incorrectly reported last week that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had eased again, but they still expect the move to come before the end of the year. In other details from today's GNP report: _ Business capital spending, a bright spot in previous quarters, slowed to an annual growth rate of 4.6 percent, compared with the advance estimate of 5.8 percent Analysts say falling corporate profits will cause businesses to further cut back in this area. _ Housing construction, which has been in a slump as a result of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s inflation-fighting campaign, fell at an annual rate of 8.4 percent, nearly double the advance estimate of a 4.8 percent decline The various changes left the economy, after adjusting for inflation, growing at an annual rate of $ 4.16 trillion in the third quarter, $ 27.7 billion higher than the second-quarter pace.

 Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> is keeping the aerobics movement alive with a bottom-line pitch to executives: `` Good fitness is good business.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> helped start the fitness boom more than 20 years ago with his best-selling book, `` Aerobics,'' and he has not let the profits of the boom slip through his well-exercised fingers. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> has developed five health centers on 30 acres in one of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'s most pricey neighborhoods. Some of the city's best-known executives and celebrities pay $ 900 a year here to grunt, growl and trudge their way to fitness. The complex includes a hotel for the health-conscious, exercise facilities, a research institute and a clinic <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> aims to make `` the Mayo Clinic of preventive medicine.'' Treadmills, exercise bicycles and rowing machines are found throughout the colonial-style complex. Outside, a mile-long rubberized track winds around the landscaped grounds, over picturesque footbridges and through groves of trees. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> says that many corporations foot the bill for their executives' membership _ both as a perk to attract quality management and in the belief healthy executives are better executives. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> quarterback <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Staubach </PERSON> have worked out at the complex. Still, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said, `` That does n't mean we do n't have the flight attendants -LRB- and -RRB- busboys. Health club members provide fodder for studies conducted at the <ORGANIZATION> Cooper </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerobics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. After each workout members use computer terminals to record their performances, which become raw data for institute researchers. The institute's research has led to more than 600 books, monographs and articles, including <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s highly publicized, 15-year study released this month showing even a modest amount of exercise can prolong life. It all was `` a great big gamble'' in 1970, when <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> quit as the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> senior flight surgeon to follow his dream of creating `` the preventive medicine center of the world.'' No bank would lend him the money to get started, despite the success of his 1968 book `` Aerobics,'' so <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> borrowed $ 1.2 million from <ORGANIZATION> Tyler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to buy a mansion and 22 acres on <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'s prestigious <LOCATION> Preston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> Since then _ while writing eight more books and signing contracts for three more _ <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> has pumped at least $ 11 million into construction and the purchase of an adjacent church to house the non-profit research institute. He says the institute is the reason for the rest of the operation. Other divisions are: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Cooper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, where nine doctors practice <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s preaching of preventive medicine A physical, complete with nutritional screening and a treadmill stress test, takes at least six hours and costs $ 850. Add cancer screening and the cost is $ 1,159. _ The in-residence programs: four -, seven - or 13-day stays where participants learn to be In addition to a physical, the program includes visits to restaurants and grocery stores where clients learn how to order and shop to avoid unhealthy food. The cost runs from $ 1,595 for the four-day program to $ 4,695 for a 13-day stay in a private suite. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> defends the cost, some of which can be borne by insurance companies, saying other programs offer less for more money. _ The guest lodge, besides providing housing for the in-residence programs in its two buildings, also is an operating hotel with the usual services and amenities There are other programs offered, including training for several government agencies such as the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>. The budget is $ 12 million a year. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the center is profitable, but would n't say how profitable. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> was one of the first to sign on at the <ORGANIZATION> Aerobics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which opened 19 years ago. `` I came out here so I can stay fit so I can work more effectively,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a 62-year-old insurance executive who credits exercise for keeping him from triple-bypass heart surgery and helping him stand the stress of a mid-career job change. `` This place has a sense of urgency,'' he said, pointing out that there are no after-jogging cocktails or partying to negate the good done by the exercise. `` Everybody's here for their own well-being, not just that country club appearance.'' While <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> likes to mention how <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran around the center's track with a pack of <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents, another well-known member brought the center unwanted notoriety. On May 1, 1985, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television sportscaster <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Glieber </PERSON> was walking around the center's track when he suffered a fatal heart attack. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> says <PERSON> Glieber </PERSON>, whom he described as a close friend, `` had let himself go.'' But <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> also noted joggers have logged 7 million miles on the Aerobic Center tracks, and <PERSON> Glieber </PERSON>'s death and two `` non-fatal cardiac events'' were the only emergencies. The death of another jogging guru, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fixx </PERSON>, in 1984, plus Glieber's attack, led <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> to write `` Running Without Fear.'' `` There is no panacea,'' he says. `` We have to keep this thing in perspective.''

<HEAD>Pest Pursuers Battle Over Cockroach Eradication Methods</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The makers of Combat and Raid have locked antennae over the lucrative cockroach-killing market, trading charges in advertising and federal court. Raid maker <ORGANIZATION> S.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has been in the business longer, giving it an advantage over the larger <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which introduced its Combat line only in 1985. Even so, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION> is posing a serious threat to <PERSON> S.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, or <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON> as the privately owned <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION>, Wis.-based company is usually known. Cyanamid fired a double-barreled blast in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, accusing <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON> in separate lawsuits of false advertising and trademark infringement. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON> counter-sued, charging that <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION>'s advertising made its own false claims. Both are asking for corrective television commercials and damages. While the legal battles go on, <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION>'s Combat has garnered more than 12 percent of the half-billion-dollar home insecticide market, making it second to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s Raid, which has about 47 percent, according to industry estimates. `` Johnson Wax seems to be the one that's scrambling to do whatever it can to defend its market-share position,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stober </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> analyst. <PERSON> Stober </PERSON> said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON>'s zeal may be leading it to excesses in advertising and packaging. `` Everyone,'' he said, `` wants to be the bigger roach killer.'' The court cases are pending before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON>. The judge dealt <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, N.J.-based Cyanamid a preliminary blow in August. Another hearing is set for January. The story begins April 26, when <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON> unveiled its Raid Max line in a media splash at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON> has said it would spend $ 100 million to advertise the line, its first since Raid hit the market in 1956. The line includes an aerosol spray killer, fogger and bait trap. Combat has the same line-up. Two days after the introduction, <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION> launched its first suit, accusing <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON> of violating a <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION> trademark for its `` Maxforce'' line, directed at exterminators and not home users. In court papers, the company said Maxforce products this year would bring in $ 3 million. Advertising cost $ 1 million. `` Cyanamid's claim that RAID <PERSON> Max </PERSON> is likely to be confused with MAXFORCE is, in my judgment, something no competent marketing person would say to his peers and expect to be believed,'' said Raid's product manager, <PERSON> Ravichandra </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saligram </PERSON>, in an affidavit. To a point, <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON> agreed. In an opinion filed Aug. 30, he refused to issue a temporary ban on the use of `` <PERSON> Max </PERSON>,'' saying there was no compelling need for such an order in advance of a fuller hearing. But even as lawyers were arguing the question on Aug. 28 before <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION> came to court with another suit. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON> advertisements aired last spring falsely claimed that Raid fumigators _ bombs that release a cloud of smoke lethal to cockroaches _ killed Combat survivors; sought out roaches while Combat was passive; went `` everywhere;'' outkilled Combat; and worked three hours after use, Cyanamid charged. Actually, Combat's maker said, Combat leaves no survivors and kills remote roaches when they cannibalize infected victims. Moreover, it said, the fumigators do n't live up to the claims. Combat ads, meanwhile, had been running in August. And now it was <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON>'s turn. In its own filing, the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> company said the Combat commercials falsely claimed the fumigator's odor could be smelled. `` In fact, the user smells only the pleasant scent of aromatic ingredients in the product,'' said the papers. Cyanamid also falsely claimed roaches do n't come back to a home treated by Combat, and that Combat was more powerful than a fumigator, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON> said. Cyanamid last month sent out a wave of attorneys to question <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wax </PERSON>'s ad people, researchers and testers. <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON> will hold a hearing in January on the dispute, said Cyanamid attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>.

<HEAD>The Holiday Budget Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Along with the holiday festivities it brings, December poses some of the toughest challenges of all in the battle to manage your money. The rush of gift-buying, party-giving and holiday travel can easily bust a budget that has been judiciously managed through the other 11 months of the year. Experts on the subject have no single magic formula to offer that will see you through the holidays with your finances unscathed. Friendships, family or business circumstances may dictate that you must spend more money at this time of year than you otherwise would. But financial advisers do suggest that your chances of staying solvent will improve drastically if you have an organized plan. `` It's wise to set up a budget before starting to shop,'' counsels the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` In addition to funds set aside for gifts, consumers should allow for extra expenses unique to the holiday season, such as food for parties and out of town guests, cards and postage, wrapping paper and decorations.'' Adds the newsletter 100 Highest Yields in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>: `` Put the same number crunching to a trip to visit the grandparents or escape the cold weather. `` What you do n't want to do is run up a huge tab on your cards or draw down your savings. The MasterCard or Visa bill will hang over your head for months. Even worse, you may need cash for an emergency and not have it.'' The season can be especially treacherous for anyone walking around with a wallet full of credit cards. `` Buying with a credit card is an added convenience during the busy holidays, especially with long lines and harried salespeople to contend with,'' the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> says. `` However, consumers should keep a wary eye on impulse buying by setting a limit on how much they intend to charge on their cards and sticking to it.'' If you are among the approximately two-thirds of all bank-card holders who do n't pay off the full balance due each month, there is an added incentive this year to keep a rein on credit purchases. Credit card interest, which always has been expensive, will get more so Jan. 1 under a change mandated by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. In 1989, 20 percent of personal interest is still tax-deductible. Next year the percentage drops to 10 percent, before going to zero in 1991. `` For consumers who do n't ordinarily work with a defined budget,'' the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> says, `` a general guideline is that credit obligations _ including credit cards, car payments and student or personal loans _ should not exceed 10 to 15 percent of take-home pay. `` These credit expenses plus mortgage or rent payments should not exceed 35 to 40 percent of gross income.'' Adroit holiday money-management can have multiple rewards. In the waning days of the year, money that is n't spent shopping can be used for charitable contributions, mortgage payments, state and local taxes, or any number of other things that might qualify as deductions on your 1989 tax return. Such planning may not do much to make your holiday merrier. But it can be considered an investment toward a happy new year.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as traders awaited news of new export sales. In the absence of significant new foreign sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain, talk among traders turned to this weekend's superpower summit meeting and the prospects that it could lead to more grain sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` They have more than a passing interest in the Bush-Gorbachev talks,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a brokers' advisory service in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

 The stock market remained broadly lower in dull trading today after a round of profit-taking at the opening. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 5.55 points to 2,696.46 at noon EST. An hour earlier, the blue-chip indicator was down 6.62 points. The decline was broad-based as losing issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 2 to 1 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 839 issues down, 450 up and 536 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 70.74 million shares. Analysts said the market had turned generally lackluster, with some institutional selling helping depress prices. `` There's not much action in the market right now,'' said <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Geronimous </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The market came under pressure starting at the opening as investors sold stocks to take advantage of recent price increases. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained nearly 70 points in the last five trading sessions. Analysts said the stock and bond markets largely ignored reports on third-quarter Gross National Product and corporate profits. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said investors are focusing on the current quarter. `` As far as the market is concerned, that is dated material,'' <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> said. `` We now know the economy is floundering and corporate profits are floundering.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2.5 percent forecast last month. A second report showed that corporate profits were down 7.2 percent in the July-September period. Analysts said the data was not likely to prompt any action by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy.

 <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is struggling along with 275 employees as a small charter carrier, the airline's top executives say, but a favorable court ruling on aircraft purchases and leases may help it get some needed cash. The future remains cloudy for the airline, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> officials told a group of disgruntled creditors Tuesday. Orlando-based <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sept. 28, its second such filing in seven years, and canceled all its regularly scheduled flights earlier this month. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s chief operating officer, said the company has `` a number of alternate plans'' but lack of financing `` prevents us from having any meaningful discussion or planning.'' He and Chairman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> are still trying to interest investors or buyers in <LOCATION> Braniff </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, a bankruptcy judge's ruling this past weekend will work in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, allowing it to add to its physical assets _ its aircraft fleet _ with long-term lease and purchase agreements for 50 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A320 jets, said company lawyer <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> ruled last Saturday that <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s contracts for the 50 airplanes with a number of aviation companies are valid, despite the bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> has an option to buy another 50 Airbuses. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> considers those contracts `` the linchpin to enable the debtor to go forward,'' <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON> said, meaning that the airline can sublease the planes or sell the contracts. The agreements also make <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> more attractive to potential buyers. However, the carrier failed to come up with $ 3 million in lease payments for five Airbuses it has already received from <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, and may have to return the jets. GPA, an Irish leasing company, is expected to sue <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> to get the five planes returned. <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON> said, however, that <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> may appeal the ruling, hoping to extend the payment deadline by 60 days. `` But that's a totally separate issue,'' he told reporters. `` If I lost the planes on the ground because we could n't pay the $ 3 million, that does n't impact the other 95 planes. The five are not critical, as much as we'd like to have them.'' What's important, he said, is the overall ruling that the agreements are valid. `` All we want is to market this position and raise money based on these planes.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Osterberg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for finance, said in response to questions from lawyers for creditors that the company had about $ 500,000 cash on hand and has current monthly expenses of about $ 1.7 million, including some $ 1 million in payroll for remaining employees. But this does not include hefty legal fees, the charter operations and other non-scheduled expenses, he said. <PERSON> Osterberg </PERSON> also said the company pays $ 1 million in rental costs every month. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> anticipates some $ 3 million to $ 4 million in credit card fees and another $ 1.5 million from other sources in December, he said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to a $ 19.75 million settlement for its 1988 spill of more than 400,000 gallons of crude oil that oozed over a 15-mile stretch of <LOCATION> Carquinez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> shoreline and nesting places, the city announced today. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Menesini </PERSON> said the bulk of the settlement, $ 11 million, wil be used to help restore wetlands damaged by the spill. The April 23, 1988, oil spill in the environmentally sensitive, 100-acre <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> adjacent to <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> refinery soiled 400 boats, killed at least 300 birds and animals, and coated critical wildlife habitats with black muck. Salmon were migrating through the <LOCATION> Carquinez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> during the spill. For comparison purposes, 365,000 gallons of oil is enough to operate 700 buses for a year and would cover 32 football fields at a depth of one-half an inch. The oil company admitted it illegally allowed storm water drain from the top of a 12.5 million gallon oil storage tank, and oil leaked through a flexible pipe in the middle of the tank, then into the slough. As part of the settlement, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 4.7 million in civil penalties for violating federal rules when it allowed the oil to bypass a collection dike and pour into the scenic waterway about 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> also will pay $ 1.3 million for environmental studies of the areas affected by the spill, including locations in <LOCATION> Benicia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Solano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The City of <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> will receive $ 500,000 to rebuild and improve fishing facilities at its shoreline, where fishing and marina business was hurt by the spill, <PERSON> Menesini </PERSON> said. The oil company also will give the city $ 250,000 to compensate for damages. `` This $ 19.75 million agreement is the largest monetary settlement of an oil spill in the history of ... <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Menesini </PERSON> said. `` It provides a clear warning that harm to our environment will not be tolerated.'' The six-month cleanup and restoration work cost <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> $ 14 million, according to the company's own estimates. Negotiations have been underway between <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> and 16 federal, state and local agencies since the spill, according to the state Department of Fish and Game. Additional settlement details were to be released at a news conference in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> later today.

 Prices finished generally higher in thin trading Wednesday on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with few substantive developments to affect the overall market. Traders said shares in financial and insurance sectors sold well, with some insurance stocks invigorated by takeover speculation. `` People are gearing themselves into a cautionary mode,'' one trader said. `` It must be because they think the market is going down and the only sector for dividend growth is financials.'' Lingering uncertainty over the direction of British interest rates has subdued buying interest, dealers said.

<HEAD>Net Earnings Fall 54 Percent at Britain's Hanson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British industrial conglomerate with large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holdings, said Wednesday its fourth-quarter profit fell about 54 percent as a result of one-time factors, while operating profit was higher. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s net profit, according to British accounting principles, fell to $ 318 million from $ 685 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30. The decline came because of a tax charge in the 1989 quarter and large one-time gains on asset sales made in the 1988 quarter, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said. Profit before taxes and one-time items rose to $ 520 million from $ 444 million. Earnings per American depository receipt on a fully diluted basis rose to 44 cents a share from 39 cents a share, according to British accounting principles. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, earnings per ADR are calculated on pre-tax profits, before tax and extraordinary one-time items. Sales in the quarter rose to $ 3.04 billion from $ 2.95 billion a year earlier. For the full fiscal year, net income fell to $ 1.78 billion from $ 1.81 billion because of decreased gains from asset sales. Profit before taxes and one-time items rose to $ 1.72 billion from $ 1.42 billion. Earnings per American depository receipt on a fully diluted basis rose to $ 1.49 a share from $ 1.28. Yearly sales fell to $ 11.3 billion from $ 11.9 billion. Lord <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, the chairman, said <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> ended the year with $ 8.5 billion in cash and a substantial borrowing capacity, putting it in a `` commanding position'' to make more acquisitions when they become available at realistic prices. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> properties include <ORGANIZATION> SCM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jacuzzi </PERSON>, Farberware, <PERSON> Endicott </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> footwear, <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gym </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> and minority interests in <ORGANIZATION> Smith-Corona </ORGANIZATION> typewriters and <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Bloomingdale's Chief Trying to Drum Up Buyout Backing in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s Chairman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Traub </PERSON>, seeking financial support for his proposed buyout of the widely known department store chain, on Wednesday said he has had `` serious'' talks with Japanese retailers. One major Japanese retailer, however, said it turned down an offer from <PERSON> Traub </PERSON>. <PERSON> Traub </PERSON> also indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s name may be affiliated with retailing in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the future. `` I am excited, as a longtime retailer, with opportunities to do retail business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he told reporters. `` I will be very pleased to have <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s cooperate with premium retailers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to successfully exploit our name and reputation.'' <PERSON> Traub </PERSON> did not reveal details of his negotiations in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The 17 <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s stores have been put up for sale by <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Canadian-based conglomerate burdened with $ 11.5 billion in debt. The <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman said he had been negotiating with four Japanese groups about backing a management buyout, but he declined to identify them. `` We are having serious, constructive conversations with parties in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he said. A spokesman for the Osaka-based <ORGANIZATION> Hankyu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that it had turned down an offer from <PERSON> Traub </PERSON>. Spokesman <PERSON> Katsuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Hankyu </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Shoji </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukumitsu </PERSON> had met with <PERSON> Traub </PERSON> on Tuesday at <PERSON> Traub </PERSON>'s request in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>. The spokesman gave no details of the offer rejected by <PERSON> Fukumitsu </PERSON>, whose company had sales of $ 2.6 billion last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, the leading Japanese economic newspaper, reported that <PERSON> Traub </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Hankyu </ORGANIZATION> to finance $ 250 million out of $ 1.2 billion to $ 1.3 billion needed for the management buyout. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Tokyu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION>, another major retailer mentioned in press reports as a possible investor in <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, declined to comment. Parties to the proposed buyout, <PERSON> Traub </PERSON> told reporters, were about 75 <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s executives willing to put up their own money, a group of `` first-class Japanese retailers'' and financial institutions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Other potential bidders are believed to be interested in the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s. Crown <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a privately held company that is among the leading developers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shopping malls, has said it may go after <PERSON> Bloomingdale </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Traub </PERSON>, who started working for <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s in 1950 and has been its head since 1978, said he expected the management buyout to be settled by mid-December, and the process to be completed in early 1990. `` We think the chance of our success is good,'' he said.

 The stock market fell in generally lackluster trading today amid continued uncertainty about interest rates. Analysts said computerized trading strategies helped push stock prices lower in the final hour of trading. Stocks came under pressure from the opening as investors took profits after the market's recent gains. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained nearly 70 points in the last five trading sessions. Analysts said the stock and bond markets largely ignored reports on third-quarter Gross National Product and corporate profits. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said investors were focusing on the current quarter. `` As far as the market is concerned, that is dated material,'' <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> said. `` We now know the economy is floundering and corporate profits are floundering.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2.5 percent forecast last month. A second report showed that corporate profits were down 7.2 percent in the July-September period. Analysts said interest rate worries continued to plague the market after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> both added and drained reserves from the banking system in recent days. Many assumed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s action last week pointed to an easing of interest rates. But the central bank confused the market with this week's draining move that sent short-term interest rates higher. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> stocks came under pressure today after <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> announced it was raising its prime rate back to 10.5 percent from 10 percent after cutting it three weeks ago. Some analysts said, however, that the market's sluggishness was merely a pause after the recent runup in stock prices and before the start of a pre-Christmas rally. `` It's two days overdue,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, chief market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> said the recent stock gains were reminiscent of the October market when a handful of blue-chip issues led the market higher before prices plunged on October 13

<HEAD>Chrysler Defends Plant Closing; UAW Sees Possible Strained Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executives on Wednesday defended the planned closing of a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> car assembly plant, a move <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union leaders say could worsen labor relations with the nation's No. 3 automaker. The executives and <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> leaders met during their annual weeklong gathering for exploring ways to ease tensions. Much of the discussion Wednesday centered on the planned Feb. 2 closing of the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> assembly plant in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> subcompact cars are made. Union members contend the closing, which will result in layoffs of about 1,700 workers, violates local and national contracts. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> maintains the closing is permitted because of slumping sales of the Omni and Horizon. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is building a new assembly plant next to the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> factory and it will employ many of the people now making <LOCATION> Omni </LOCATION> and Horizon cars. But training for those workers wo n't begin until Fall 1991. `` We're a little upset at being the last person to know of the closing of the Jefferson plant,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowling </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 110 in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` The press knew before we did, and we do n't think that's right. `` -LRB- UAW President -RRB- <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said it pretty well this morning. He told them that he did n't appreciate it.'' The company announced on Nov. 3, shortly after a story about the closing appeared in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, that it was halting production at the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> factory and trimming production at its car plant in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for labor relations, said the first 2 -LCB- days of the meeting were constructive, as union and company officials talked about joint training programs. `` Today, there was some initial tension because there was some concern over the way the <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> situation had been handled,'' he said Wednesday. `` There was a lot of frustration there from an employee's standpoint.'' St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> told union members that the Jefferson Avenue plant had fallen victim to slow cars sales. `` Basically, one-shift production is 470 units a day and -LRB- daily -RRB- sales orders were averaging about 220, indicating that we were losing money on each vehicle,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. Bowling said <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> told the union leaders that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> would try to better handle announcements such as the Jefferson Avenue plant closing. Bowling said he would be satisfied if the company kept its commitments. Upper-level <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> officials have been gathering for similar annual meetings since 1986 and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> has spoken at the previous ones. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> skipped this year's opportunity to address union representatives, saying there was a longstanding previous commitment. The meeting began eight days after hundreds of angry <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> members paraded outside <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> enclave of <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, protesting the planned Jefferson Avenue closing. Contract talks between the union and the nation's Big Three automakers _ <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> _ begin next summer. Union contracts with the companies expire at midnight, Sept. 14, 1990.

<HEAD>Gold Price Slide Steepens</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Gold prices fell sharply Wednesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, steepening a slide that represents either a temporary setback in a bull market or gold's retreat from its highest point in nearly a year. `` I think the verdict is still out on that one,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonat </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Deak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based dealer of precious metals and foreign currencies. On other futures markets Wednesday, pork-belly futures fell the limit for the second straight day; energy futures advanced; and grains and soybeans were mixed. Gold futures settled $ 3.90 to $ 4 lower on the Comex with the contract for delivery in December down $ 4 at $ 409.50 a troy ounce. Silver fell 9.5 cents to 9.7 cents with December settling at $ 5.60 a troy ounce. The December gold contract has dropped more than $ 10 since Friday, when it peaked at $ 419.70, the highest <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> gold price since mid-December. <PERSON> Jonat </PERSON> said he was surprised gold fell so sharply after Tuesday's very slight loss, which he had taken as a sign that a wave of profit-taking had passed Nevertheless, he said, `` I'm reluctant to say the path is going to be down.'' Analyst <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based futures brokerage, blamed the decline on selling ahead of the first notice day for the December gold contract. Under Comex rules, Thursday is the first day for traders to declare their intention to deliver gold against the December contract. A relatively large number of delivery notices are expected, and traders on the `` buy'' side of December contracts must sell contracts to avoid taking physical delivery. `` The market has been in a little bit of a nervous condition ahead of this delivery position,'' <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said. `` After the pressure is out of the way from the first day of deliveries, the market will then resume its trend.'' Pork-belly futures prices slammed down the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit for the second straight day on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after the government announced it had accepted bids for 920,000 pounds of pork bellies to be shipped to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as part of a food aid package. The announcement follows last week's announcement of a 280,000-pound government purchase, bringing to 1.2 million pounds the amount of bellies the government has bought to ship to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The market's reaction reflected disappointment that the government is not moving more quickly toward obtaining the total of 22 million pounds that it is expected to buy. `` At this pace, it would take forever to fill up a cargo to send over there,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, senior livestock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Live cattle futures settled .07 cent to .72 cent lower with December at 75.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .32 cent lower to .17 cent higher with November at 83.72 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent to .63 cent lower with December at 50.52 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.98 cents to 2 cents lower with February at 60.55 cents a pound. Energy futures rose moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting sentiments that the market had overreacted Tuesday to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to raise its crude-oil output on Jan. 1 to 22 million barrels per day from 20.5 million. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 15 cents higher with January at $ 19.40 a barrel; heating oil was .30 cent to .59 cent higher with December at 60.61 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .19 cent to .35 cent higher with December at 49.72 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures prices finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a lackluster session. Wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with December at $ 4.05 -RCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.34 -RCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent lower with December at $ 1.42 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent lower to 3 -LCB- cents higher with January at $ 5.79 \ a bushel

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed as West German Mark Dominates Trading; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar turned in a mixed performance Wednesday as the West German mark continued to dominate the foreign exchange markets. Gold prices fell sharply in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after edging higher overseas. `` The dollar was relatively neutral'' as most currency traders focused on the mark, said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, chief dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The mark fell amid profit-taking in response to a surge since <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall Nov. 9. The opening of the wall raised expectations that West German industry would benefit from the relaxation of East-West tensions. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that the gross national product grew at an annual rate of 2.7 percent during the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2.5 percent rate originally reported last month. The news gave the dollar some support but tended more to prompt selling of the mark, <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said. The dollar gained against the West German currency in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, rising to 1.7875 marks from 1.7770 late Tuesday. In earlier <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> trading, the dollar closed at 1.7825 marks, down from 1.7880. The British pound edged up to $ 1.5678 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from $ 1.5670 late Tuesday, and sterling also rose earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, closing at $ 1.5655, compared with late Tuesday's $ 1.5625. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5920 Swiss francs, up from 1.5880; 6.0935 French francs, up from 6.0710; 1,318.75 Italian lire, up from 1,312.75; and 1.16525 Canadian dollars, down from 1.6645. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.12 Japanese yen to a closing 143.53 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it fell further to 143.15 yen and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 142.855 yen, down from 143.20. The dollar declined in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but dealers said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency had regained some ground before the close. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.5895 Swiss francs, down from 1.5950; 6.0810 French francs, down from 6.1035; 2.0100 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0270; 1,315.50 Italian lire, down from 1,319.50; 1.1658 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1674 Gold prices declined sharply in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after rising slightly overseas. On the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a troy ounce of gold fell $ 4 to $ 409.50, while <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s late bid for gold slipped $ 5.65 to $ 407.70 a troy ounce. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, a metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the dollar's gains following its recent slide probably contributed to Wednesday's decline in gold. Profit-taking and a decline in platinum prices also were factors, he said. Gold recently crossed the $ 400 an ounce level for the first time since January. Platinum fell nearly $ 16 to $ 513.20 a troy ounce on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, gold rose to a late bid price of $ 412.50 a troy ounce, up from $ 411.25 bid late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, it rose to $ 411.70 bid from $ 410.50 bid late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 2.16 to close at a bid $ 411.35. Silver fell 9.5 cents to $ 5.600 on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after rising earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 5.65 a troy ounce, up from $ 5.64 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Petroleum futures prices rebounded Wednesday in a technical reaction to Tuesday's selloff. Forecasts of continuing cold weather in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> spurred buying of wholesale home heating oil. Despite the rebound, the renewed buying in the energy futures pits was restrained because traders still were downcast about the new <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production agreement. The cartel's higher output ceiling is expected to weigh on prices. The January contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, made up less than half of Tuesday's 38-cent loss It rose 15 cents to close at $ 19.40 per 42-gallon barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Contracts for delivery in February through April finished with smaller gains. Among refined petroleum products traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, No. 2 heating oil for December delivery rose 0.30 cent to 60.61 cents a gallon after falling 0.61 cent on Tuesday The January through March contracts ended with larger increases. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> analyst, said expectations of an extended cold snap on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and in other parts of the country probably boosted heating oil demand slightly. For much of the autumn, unusually mild temperatures caused a buildup in heating oil stocks in the Northeast. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery finished 0.19 cent higher at 49.72 cents a gallon, erasing a small portion of Tuesday's drop of 1.36 cents. Contracts for later delivery posted larger gains. Energy market analysts said traders still were preoccupied with the outcome of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>' winter conference At a meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, ministers from the cartel's 13 members agreed to raise their self-imposed daily production limit to 22 million barrels for the first half of next year from the current 20.5 million barrels. Other than the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> developments, there was little news for traders to act on. The energy markets had slumped Tuesday on word of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreement. The selling may have been overdone and Wednesday's modest recovery was described by traders as a technical correction.

 Interest rate jitters continued to pressure the stock market Wednesday, pushing prices lower. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 13.23 points to 2,688.78. Losing issues outpaced gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 892 issues down, 595 up and 484 unchanged. Trading activity was generally sluggish throughout the session. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 147.27 million shares, down from 153.77 million in Tuesday's session. Bank stocks took the biggest hit, reflecting disappointment over the recent mixed signals by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> as well as the decision by <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> to raise its prime rate back to 10.5 percent. The small Midwestern bank, which often leads prime rate moves by bigger banks, had cut the rate to 10 percent recently. `` This certainly does n't bode well for the short-term,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, head of block trading for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> confused the financial markets by first letting key short-term interest rates fall last week, which led analysts to conclude that the central bank was easing credit to stimulate the economy. But Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> sent a strong signal that it was n't easing credit Stock prices nonetheless had advanced in the previous two sessions. The market came under pressure at the opening bell Wednesday from profit-takers anxious to cash in on the recent gains. A handful of blue-chip issues led a narrow rally by midday but the broader market did not follow and the gains were quickly erased. Two separate reports that showed an upward revision in the Gross National Product and lower corporate profits in the third quarter were generally overlooked by investors. The government reported that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2.5 percent previously forecast. And corporate profits fell 7.2 percent in the July-September period, a second report showed. Some Wall Street analysts attributed the market's sluggishness to a pause after the recent runup in stock prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 70 points in the last five trading sessions. `` We're looking for a year-end rally. But to make it worthwhile ... we need to work off the overbought conditions by perhaps going lower,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, equities analyst with <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 179.40 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market declined $ 17.871 billion, or 0.53 percent, in value.

 <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> has announced plans to raise economy and first-class fares, while <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it would increase the price of discount tickets. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it plans to raise its MaxSaver fares, the most deeply discounted advance-purchase fares, by $ 10 to $ 20 round trip starting Dec. 16. The MaxSavers would be increased by $ 10 on flights of less than 1,000 miles and $ 20 on longer trips. `` I would think the other airlines would follow <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> because we're seeing costs increase pretty sharply,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkman </PERSON>, an airline analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's going to be a carrier-by-carrier decision,'' he said. `` They're going to have to look at their advance bookings and decide.'' Passenger traffic normally begins increasing at this time of year, a peak holiday travel season. Last week, in a bid to bolster sagging revenues, a number of major carriers led by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said they plan to raise fares on most domestic routes and eliminate discount fares used mainly by business travelers. The increases did n't apply to the popular MaxSavers, however. Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, which announced its move Tuesday, is the last major airline to follow <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s lead. Under the change, first-class, one-way fares will increase by $ 8, while full-fare and some discounted coach prices will go up by $ 5. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> decided Wednesday to postpone the fare hikes until Dec. 8, spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON> said. They originally were scheduled to take effect Thursday.

<TEXT>
 A plan to sell <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest auto insurer, as part of a hostile takeover bid for parent BAT Industries is questionable and should be rejected, attorneys for Farmers told state insurance regulators Wednesday But Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, the Anglo-French financier whose <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> is mounting the bid, dismissed the argument as a desperate tactic in BAT management's `` no-holds-barred takeover defense.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> hearings that began Wednesday are to determine the suitability of <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> to become Farmers' parent through the proposed acquisition of BAT, the London-based tobacco, retailing, paper and financial services concern. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s $ 21.1 billion BAT takeover plan was suspended earlier this year to allow <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> to seek approval from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state insurance commissioners to change Farmers' ownership. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> has vowed to sell off all of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s non-tobacco holdings under the buyout plan. Farmers would be sold to French insurer Axa Midi Assurance for $ 4.5 billion. Los Angeles-based Farmers operates in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and eight other states. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is the first to begin review of the takeover bid to determine if it is in the best interest of insurance policyholders. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> has attempted unsuccessfully to block the reviews, arguing that state regulators have no constitutional right to pass judgment on a foreign buyout. During Wednesday's hearing, attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> argued that the question of the company's suitability to own or operate an insurance carrier is irrelevant because if the BAT takeover is successful, <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> plans to simultaneously sell Farmers to <LOCATION> Axa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midi </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>'s consistent position is and has been that it has no wish to own and operate an insurance company in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ and Farmers in particular,'' <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said in opening statements before <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the former state supreme court justice serving as hearing officer. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> has entered into `` irrevocable contracts ensuring that <ORGANIZATION> Axa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midi </ORGANIZATION> will own and control'' Farmers, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> does not seek approval to own and operate Farmers,'' he said, but rather authority to `` act purely as a conduit'' in the sale of the company to <ORGANIZATION> Axa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midi </ORGANIZATION>. But Farmers attorney <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadwater </PERSON> questioned whether an immediate sale was a certainty. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> had already offered state insurance regulators three possible plans for the sale, only to change them later. `` Every time <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> comes up with yet another possible scheme, this department is assured that nothing could go wrong,'' <PERSON> Broadwater </PERSON> said, calling the takeover plan `` legally bizarre.'' He also said <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>'s financial position is precarious and that it lacks the qualifications to run an insurance business. `` It is an offshore company engaged in no business other than to acquire BAT,'' <PERSON> Broadwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> said in a statement that Farmers' argument was an attempt to divert attention away from the merits of acquisition of the company by <ORGANIZATION> Axa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midi </ORGANIZATION>. `` The suggestion that there is any danger of <PERSON> Midi </PERSON> not completing the acquisition of Farmers is ludicrous,'' he said. A hearing on the takeover plan before <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> regulators is scheduled for January. Those in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are expected later next year, a <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> spokesman said. Hearings in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have n't been scheduled, he said.

<TEXT>
 A group of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinist </ORGANIZATION> union leaders and striking workers could face federal civil contempt charges stemming from an altercation between pickets and working employees, according to an order issued Wednesday. A modification to a four-month-old temporary restraining order calls for the 13 defendants to appear Dec. 12 in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for a hearing on Sunday's disturbance in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Seven strikers were arrested on charges of unlawful assembly when they refused to leave <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> after a group of pickets pelted cars with rocks and injured a working Eastern employee. On Monday, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Aviation Commisioner <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> ordered the strikers to dismantle a tent city erected on airport grounds shortly after the Machinists went on strike March 4. The strikers have established a new compound near the airport. The show-cause order issued by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> cites `` willful defiance'' of a July 17 temporary restraining order prohibiting the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> pickets from threatening or injuring Eastern workers. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> is overseeing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization of the Miami-based airline, which filed for protection five days after the strike began. Machinist union leaders, meanwhile, huddled in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to assess the impact the defections of pilots and flight attendants would have on their strike and pledged to continue their walkout `` however long it takes.'' Machinists union President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> said the union would try to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, and the bankruptcy court overseeing the cash-strapped carrier into a settlement. The plans include demanding that <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> remove himself from the case. <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> and other Machinists leaders have accused <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> of bias in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. The Machinists cited in the order could face fines and court costs if found in contempt, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. They include <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pecca </PERSON>, Machinist officials based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>'s order also requires that a special union telephone message in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> carry a statement from Local 1690 General Chairman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> condemning the Sunday incident and saying the union `` does not condone these acts or are they part of the ... strike strategy.'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>' local, said Wednesday he had not received the filing and declined to comment Defendants are expected to receive the order no later than Friday. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> noted that the temporary restraining order and the show-cause order only affect <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, meanwhile, talks opened Wednesday between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its flight attendants union, which joined pilots last week in ending an 8 -LCB- - month-old sympathy strike <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the two-hour meeting produced no agreements, and the flight attendants are scheduled to make a contract proposal Monday. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickley </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, declined to give details of the contract offer. The <ORGANIZATION> TWU </ORGANIZATION> represents flight attendants at Eastern. She said topics raised at Wednesday's meeting included the company policy for rehiring workers and the union's suit against the airline seeking back union dues. Eastern currently has about 3,400 flight attendants. The union represented about 6,000 workers at the beginning of the strike, but it is unknown how many remain, said Ms. <PERSON> Mickley </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cognata </PERSON> held the first negotiating session Tuesday between the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern management, which began rebuilding without its unions following the walkout. The airline has asked <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to clarify the rights of employees and those of strikers who wish to return to work. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said no hearing date had been set on that request.

<HEAD>Boeing Engineers Call in Mediator, Machinists File Grievance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal mediator was called Wednesday into contract talks between The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and its engineers, while the machinists union that ended a strike only 10 days ago filed a grievance against the aerospace giant. Negotiators for the second-largest union at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, contacted a federal mediator after receiving a `` disappointing'' money offer from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, union general counsel <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Their view of an acceptable offer does n't harmonize with <ORGANIZATION> SPEEA </ORGANIZATION>'s view,'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. `` This is always the way it is; you never flat-out accept what they lay on the table. To expedite whatever movement there might be, we thought it was wise to get the mediator in there to talk to both parties.'' Mediator <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Youtsey </PERSON> started moving between company and union negotiating teams Wednesday morning. Non-economic and some economic issues had been resolved, but a number of money disagreements remained, including the `` entire wage offer,'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. He declined to elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> also refused to discuss details of the offer Wednesday. `` At this point in negotiations it's not uncommon for a mediator to come in to assist in reaching a final agreement,'' <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> SPEEA </ORGANIZATION> executive director and chief negotiator <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Baer </PERSON> said Wednesday he hoped to conclude talks within the next few days and mail an offer to members. <ORGANIZATION> SPEEA </ORGANIZATION> has two contracts under negotiation, covering a total of about 27,800 workers. The contracts expire Friday, but have been extended until new contracts are reached. Machinists, who comprise the largest union at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, used federal mediator <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> for much of their talks with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> negotiators and <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> proposed the compromise package finally accepted by both sides, bringing the 48-day strike to an end on Nov. 20. The machinists contract affects some 57,800 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers. But the machinists' union, <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, filed a grievance with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday complaining the company violated strike settlement and collective bargaining agreements by reassigning 838 employees to lower-ranked and lower-paying posts as they returned to work because of the strike. The union asks that each employee be returned to the work location, shift, labor grade and job classification that he or she held on the day of work prior to the strike, and that all employees be compensated for any loss of benefits and wages. <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> acknowledged receipt of the grievance but said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> maintains no employees `` received any reduction in pay or anything.'' He declined to discuss the issue further. The 27,800 engineers, scientists and technical aides covered under <ORGANIZATION> SPEEA </ORGANIZATION> contracts at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> have never gone out on strike. Ninety-five percent of them work in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area. <ORGANIZATION> SPEEA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> negotiators have been meeting every week day sinc Nov. 2, plus last weekend. <ORGANIZATION> SPEEA </ORGANIZATION> had asked for a salary adjustment of 35 percent over three years, including 14 percent in the first six months. But <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said the union had made some reductions since presenting its first proposal. Pay for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> engineers and scientists averages about $ 39,000 annually, while technical aides earn an average of $ 29,000. The machinists won annual wage increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, plus bonuses of 10 percent, 5 percent and 4 percent, and a cost-of-living adjustment equal to almost 100 percent of inflation.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Combustion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has entered a joint venture with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and a Finnish company to build a $ 2 billion petrochemical complex in western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. The complex in the town of <LOCATION> Tobolsk </LOCATION> will produce petrochemicals such as propylene and polypropylene, using western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>'s rich supply of natural resources, the industrial services company said. The petrochemicals are to be used in consumer goods, as well as products for the automotive and medical markets. The first three plants in the complex in <LOCATION> Tobolsk </LOCATION>, located 1,100 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, are expected to be finished in 1993, <ORGANIZATION> Combustion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Amour </PERSON> said. A second phase would add more plants that would produce different chemicals, while the third phase calls for another complex in the Soviet town of <LOCATION> Surgut </LOCATION>, 270 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tobolsk </LOCATION>. The joint venture is between <ORGANIZATION> Tobolsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petrochemical </ORGANIZATION>, formed by the Soviet department of chemicals and oil refineries, and a consortium of Western companies led by <ORGANIZATION> Combustion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Neste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, a petrochemical company. Combustion Engineering is to manage the project and handle foreign currency financing. <ORGANIZATION> Neste </ORGANIZATION> is to market the products worldwide. <PERSON> Armour </PERSON> said Combustion Engineering and <ORGANIZATION> Neste </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to put up a total of 15 percent of the seed capital, with the Soviets contributing the rest. She said most of the project's $ 2 billion cost will be raised through debt financing. Several banks are providing the credit, including the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lyonnais </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and a Finnish bank. Plans for the second complex would be developed during the second construction phase in <LOCATION> Tobolsk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Amour </PERSON> said. Combustion Engineering also produces software programs as well as instrumentation and control products used in the hydrocarbon business under a 1987 joint Soviet venture. <PERSON> Armour </PERSON> said the venture has been operating since early this year. Combustion Engineering, which had sales of $ 3.5 billion last year, provides products and services used in the power and process industries, including power plants, oil refineries and waste-to-energy plants.

 Federal authorities probing trading abuses at the city's commodity exchange reportedly have expanded the investigation to include stock-index futures trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> said it had expelled and fined $ 100,000 a trader who previously pleaded guilty to federal charges. Six traders from the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index futures pit received subpoenas earlier this week to testify before a federal grand jury regarding trades they made during the 1987 stock-market crash, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported in Wednesday's editions The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> said at least seven S & amp; P 500 traders had received subpoenas and two more were expected to be called before the grand jury. The newspapers, both citing unidentified sources, said the subpoenas represented a widening of an investigation that so far has resulted in the indictments of 47 traders and one clerk at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> declined comment on the reports. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he could not confirm the reports. `` We've always been aware that it is a continuing investigation,'' <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> said. Until this week, the investigation had been confined to traders in the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s Japanese yen and Swiss Franc trading pits and in the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s soybean and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> pits. In those cases, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents worked undercover as traders for more than two years to gather evidence of alleged cheating of customers by brokers while executing their orders in the pits. In contrast, the new twist in the investigation reportedly targets traders who already have been disciplined by the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> for alleged trading abuses during the October 1987 stock market crash. Stock-index futures are contracts to buy or sell baskets of stocks, such as those represented by the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 index, for a specified price on a future date. Index futures are used variously for hedging against losses in the stock market and for speculating on the market's movements. The <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 pit is the world's largest and most active stock-index futures market. Stock-index futures are frequently used in computerized program strategies that some experts believe contributed to the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash and the market decline of last Oct. 13. In one such strategy known as index arbitrage, traders move huge amounts of stock rapidly in attempts to profit from brief discrepancies between prices of stocks and the index futures. Other program trading strategies also have been blamed for contributing to the severity of the market's downturns. However, the futures industry contends the index futures markets provided a relief valve for selling during those steep market drops and prevented the stock market from falling even further. In a statement, the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> said it had expelled <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON>, one of the 21 traders of Japanese yen futures indicted on Aug. 2, and fined him $ 100,000 for making pre-arranged trades with his brother <PERSON> James </PERSON> in April 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON> `` participated in an ongoing pattern of illegal transactions in which brokers deliberately converted customer funds and market opportunities to their own use and the use of others.'' The Sledz brothers were among the first of the traders indicted last August to reach plea agreements with federal prosecutors. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON> has pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of violating the Commodities Exchange Act. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON> has pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud and one count of violating the Commodities Exchange Act. The <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> said the offenses for which it expelled <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON> were the same as the federal offenses to which he has pleaded guilty.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it will renew controversial long-term water contracts in central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, assuring farmers will get the current volume of irrigation water well into the next century. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> directed a formal environmental review of how the massive diversion of federal water for irrigation affects the environment. But officials acknowleged the review will not hold up contract renewals, nor affect the duration of the new water leases or the amount of water supplied. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> did say the price of the water will more than quadruple, and price and other terms could be affected by the review. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said the leases would commit the government to supplying current levels of water _ 1.5 million acre-feet, or 489 billion gallons per year _ to scores of local irrigation districts in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> over the next 40 years. An acre-foot or 326,000 gallons is about what a family of five uses at home in a year. The renewal of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> water contracts, one of the thorniest water issues in the West, has developed into a major environmental test for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The administration has been split on the issue with the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the president's Council on Environmental Quality, supported by environmental groups, arguing that formal environmental reviews should be conducted before the government commits itself to renewal. One lease, to the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cove </LOCATION> irrigation district came due last April and was renewed amid strong criticism from environmentalists. Several of the leases are expected to be up for renewal within weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the contracts when renewed would be subject to `` adjustments'' based on the findings in the environmental review. These adjustments could included changes in water price, requirements for increased conservation and manner of delivery. But <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said the 40-year lease duration and the quantity of water _ 1.5 million acre-feet a year _ would not be subject to change. Under the plan announced Wednesday, a formal study would be initiated to determine the effect of the water diversion on wildlife, water quality and natural resources. In additon, the department's Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will study the effect on endangered species. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pashayan </PERSON>, R-Calif., whose district is in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, called the decision `` a profound victory for farmers. But Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the water, power and offshore energy resources subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>'s decision to renew the leases without waiting for completion of the environmental studies amounted to `` a case study in duplicity. `` What value is an environmental study of the impact of water diversion if the amount of water divered is non-negotiable?'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The Natural Resources Defense Council, a long-time opponent of the government's policy of selling water to some <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> farmers for $ 8 an acre-foot when it costs eight to 10 times that much, said in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> it was pleased the department had decided to require an environmental impact statement. `` But we take strong exception to <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>'s decision not to review the most important terms of the new contracts in its <ORGANIZATION> EIS </ORGANIZATION>, namely the quantity of water to be diverted from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for agricultural purposes,'' consultant <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> said. She added that the group `` will continue to pursue an <ORGANIZATION> EIS </ORGANIZATION> on all the terms.'' In a lawsuit against the department filed by environmental groups, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has said any contract renewals would be subject to provisons of his eventual ruling. The long-term irrigation leases are expiring at a time when <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is struggling to develop new water distribution and water quality protection plans. Disputes over water for decades have pitted Northern Californians against those in the southern part of the state, and city-dwellers against farmers. Critics also argue that the large water diversions at below-cost prices have kept farmers from conserving water when growing urban centers, willing to pay high prices for water, are having trouble arranging future supplies.

<HEAD>Stockholders Approve Varity Acquisition of Former Fruehauf Corp.</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed $ 579 million acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> K-H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was approved by K-H stockholders Wednesday, the company said. The sale is the last stage in the dismantling of Fruehauf to pay debt from a leveraged buyout arranged to fight off a 1986 takeover attempt. K-H's main holding is <ORGANIZATION> Kelsey-Hayes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a producer of aluminum wheels and anti-lock braking systems. Fruehauf changed its name to K-H on Aug. 4 after selling maritime operations and the truck-trailer manufacturing business that had been its mainstay. The trailer business continues as <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trailer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Terex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> K-H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will become a wholly owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION> Massey-Ferguson </ORGANIZATION>, a Toronto-based maker of farm and industrial machinery. The transaction could be completed Thursday or Friday, K-H spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hladik </PERSON> said. Fruehauf borrowed $ 1.5 billion in 1986 in a restructuring arranged in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to fend off a hostile takeover attempt by investor <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>. Weighed down with debt, the company ran into ill-timed reverses in the truck trailer business, including increased competition and a surge in materials costs, such as the price of aluminum, <PERSON> Hladik </PERSON> said. `` We ended up selling off all our assets to pay off the debt,'' he said. Those included a fleet of 5,000 leased trailers, a financial subsidiary and an aerospace unit. The trailer and maritime operations _ including two shipyards and a heavy crane and cargo handling equipment division _ were sold to <ORGANIZATION> Terex </ORGANIZATION> on July 14 for $ 232.5 million. `` The sale of the trailer operation was more or less the end of Fruehauf,'' <PERSON> Hladik </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> agreed to acquire K-H for about $ 579 million. That included $ 41.3 million in cash, the transfer of 37.8 million worth of new <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> common shares to K-H stockholders, and assumption of $ 436.8 million in K-H debt by <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION>. K-H employs about 7,000 people. It has seven plants in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, three in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, one each in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and four in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hladik </PERSON> said.
