 A 54-year-old windsurfer was arrested and booked into jail in a wet bathing suit after she allegedly tried to use her board to make a getaway from a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officer. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Felicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuznar </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Jensen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, was charged with careless operation of a vessel, interfering with navigation, resisting arrest without violence, and fleeing and eluding law officers. Her problems with Officer <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> began when Mrs. <PERSON> Kuznar </PERSON> was windsurfing Wednesday near the <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Causeway </PERSON> and a powerboat entered the channel. Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the powerboat had to `` take evasive action to avoid an accident,'' so she approached Mrs. <PERSON> Kuznar </PERSON> in her patrol boat to discuss the matter. Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Kuznar </PERSON> refused orders that she bring her windsurfer to shore and `` told me to get lost.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kuznar </PERSON> said she was trying to get to shore, and complained that the officer swamped her with the patrol boat's wake.

<HEAD>Nikkei Rises Slightly After Worst Trading Week This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The main market barometer recouped early losses by the close of half-day trading Saturday, but still finished lower at the end of its worst trading week so far this year. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a sharp 391.13-point loser Friday, lost nearly 80 points shortly after trading started, but claimed back lost ground to close the day at 27,301.34 points, up 16.33 points, or 0.059 percent. `` The index moved up mainly on profit-taking,'' said <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsumata </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage. `` <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> and IC-related companies moved higher up,'' but otherwise `` the market was very quiet,'' the spokesman added. Shares from <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, a leading consumer electronics maker, closed at a historic high 6,460 yen, up 430 yen, surpassing its previous record close reached Friday. Volume on the first section during the half-day session totaled 600 million shares. Despite Saturday's slight gain, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index closed the week down 612.45 points, or 2.19 percent, from a 27,913.79-point close July 15. It had lost 513.09 points during Tuesday trading alone. `` People are anxious about higher interest rates,'' said <PERSON> Katsumata </PERSON>. Banks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have all raised their rates, `` but only <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is sticking to a lower rate,'' he added. The market next week will just move `` up and down, up and down,'' the spokesman predicted. The foreign exchange market is closed on Saturdays.

 Evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> received a standing ovation from about 2,500 followers Friday at his first crusade outside his home state of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> since he was defrocked amid reports he had hired a prostitute. The three days of revival meetings were not supported by the national or local offices of the Assemblies of God, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s former denomination But crowds lined up at the door and sales of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s albums and tapes were brisk. `` I'm forgiving to him. He's not exempt from sin or temptation,'' said <PERSON> Etta </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, who arrived with her husband two hours before the arena doors opened to grab front-row seats. She said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> should put his troubles behind him and get on with his life. `` I wanted to show that men make mistakes, and he's forgiven,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Randle </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. `` Since he told the truth, everyone wants to get on him.'' In February, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> tearfully confessed on television that he had committed an unspecified sin against <PERSON> God </PERSON> and his family. The confession was followed by allegations that he had hired a prostitute to perform lewd acts while he watched. Assemblies of God pastors were told `` not to be supportive or cooperative with <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> Ministries any longer,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Shank </PERSON>, district superintendent of the nation's largest Pentecostal denomination. `` He has been disciplined by the church and is n't part of our fellowship.'' Nevertheless, organizers planned for at least 8,000 followers, including Assemblies of God members, to attend the crusade each night. As the band struck up an upbeat religious song, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, kneeled to greet the outstretched hands of members of the audience who walked up to the stage. `` I thank you for your kindness and your love,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said. `` I thank you for literally opposing every force of darkness and saying, ` We love you.''' `` It's such a thrill to be here. We love you more than we can express,'' <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> told the crowd. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, singing and playing the piano, appeared in good humor as he kidded his wife about her fervent address to the audience. `` She's always complaining about those women creatures throwing their hands up. I'm going to show her that on television in a few weeks, and we'll see.'' The crusade is being videotaped for the relatively few television stations that have not canceled <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s program. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> did n't refer directly to his troubles Friday night, but he urged the audience to write checks or give cash totaling $ 100 or more to save his television ministry. `` We desperately, desperately need that help,'' he said. `` I do not ask it for me, I ask it for souls.'' Outside the 17,000-seat downtown Market Square Arena, a handful of protesters carried signs reading, `` Ban the Bible'' and `` Ban Christianity.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said he viewed the crusade in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> as a fresh start. `` I've changed an awful lot,'' he said after a dress rehearsal. `` I'm more keenly aware of the hurt and pain of other people. I'm more aware of their weaknesses and despair. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> returned to the pulpit May 22, but was defrocked by the Assemblies of God for refusing to abstain from preaching for a year while undergoing professional counseling. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, 52, said his multimillion-dollar global ministry could not survive such an absence. <PERSON> Jozette </PERSON> <PERSON> Ausbury </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Assemblies of God in its <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, headquarters said members could not be punished for attending the crusade. `` They can go if they want to. That's fine,'' she said. The church had not decided whether ministers who attend the crusade could be punished. The church has not ruled what sanctions it would apply to local ministers who might help the crusade, but it has given ministers at <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> until Oct. 1 to leave or be defrocked. No local Assemblies of God ministers are known to be assisting the crusade. <PERSON> Baldock </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Compassion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, Mission on Wheels and Ark of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, recruited about 300 volunteers to serve as ushers, security guards and support staff. `` I preach just like most of my brothers preach _ forgiveness, love and mercy, restoration,'' <PERSON> Baldock </PERSON> said. `` That's not only with Reverend <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. That's with anyone accepting the message of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> that has a problem. And because I'm forgiven. `` The scriptures teach us that if we expect to be forgiven we must forgive ourselves.''

 They live by a brutal code of each man for himself in prison, but in the middle of the woods they learn to stand together against a fiery enemy that is not affected by their crimes, color or gangs. `` We ca n't bring our problems with us to the fire lines,'' said <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON>, 20, of <PERSON> Hollister </PERSON>, who is serving time in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Youth Authority for burglary. <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> was among hundreds of state prisoners battling a pair of arson-linked wildfires in heavy timber and brush near the <LOCATION> Calaveras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION>, 150 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> on Friday offered a $ 10,000 reward for the capture of the arsonist and declared a state of emergency in the county. Nearly 11,000 acres and six homes had been charred by Friday as firefighters neared containment of the blazes, which have caused an estimated $ 3.8 million damage to the drought-parched region since Tuesday. Wielding shovels, saws and other hand tools, state fire Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Segura </PERSON>'s strike team of inmates stood guard Thursday when the fire burned out to a section of the more than 18 miles of bare-earth control lines that firefighters had carved around the fires. `` Let it burn right to the edge,'' <PERSON> Segura </PERSON> bellowed at the inmates, clad in orange jumpsuits. Some of the inmates had to use ladders off a nearby state pumper truck to climb up the near-vertical mountain toward the advancing flames. Within minutes, he told his crew from the <ORGANIZATION> DeWitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nelson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> CYA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION> that it seemed the line would hold for the time being. A few of the inmates slid down the slope hand over hand on a fire hose. Others descended on the ladder. Hours after being dumped off from a stifling personnel truck, it was finally break time. `` This is better than being behind walls,'' <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> said in an idle moment. Added team member <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>: `` Every time they ask, ` You want to go on a fire?' everybody stands up and says ` Yeah.''' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>, is serving a sentence for possession of cocaine. Inmates in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Youth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> or state prison systems can volunteer to train as firefighters, but candidates are screened to determine that they are suited and that they are low security risks. Supervisors are unarmed, but even so there are very few escape attempts. Correctional officer <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, supervising state prisoners in line for food at the Rail Road Flat fire camp after coming off the lines, said most of the inmate firefighters are proud of what they do. `` They like getting outside and later you hear them say things like ` Hey, we saved a house there,''' <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said. Added prisoner <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bright </PERSON>, with a sincere expression on his face: `` It's a good way to pay my debt to society.'' Bright, 36, who is serving time for insurance fraud, works out of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> camp near Folsom Prison. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said he and other crew supervisors make allowances because of the nature of the work. `` If you're out there for more than a week at a time, they get antsy. If you're real strict, they wo n't respond in a good way, and you do n't need tension on a fire,'' he said. The inmates said they realize the work is dangerous, but trust the supervisors to keep them alive. One prisoner said the work has changed the direction of his life. `` I'd like to become a professional firefighter,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` The first week I get out, I'm going to put in an application somewhere.''

<TEXT>
 A contaminated water hose in the kitchen of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>'s cadet dining hall apparently caused the outbreak of food poisoning that affected 673 people, academy officials said Friday. Officials said a floor drain had backed up in the kitchen of <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> on July 12, and the hose was placed in the drain in an effort to clear it. The hose then was used to rinse celery that was put in the chicken salad served at lunch that day. Bacteriological tests shows the hose was contaminated with E. coli bacteria. Tests were still being conducted on the food to confirm that the bacteria in the hose caused the outbreak of gastroenteritis. Academy officials said they planned to have civil engineers examine the 30-year-old drain system. They also said they planned to review kitchen procedures, including how food handlers are trained and supervised.

<HEAD>Scientists Say Pentagon Starting Dangerous Germ Warfare Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group called the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> has announced a campaign to persuade university biologists to turn aside <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> requests for additional research into germ warfare. At a news conference Friday, four scientists on the committee said the Pentagon is asking for $ 300 million to conduct research into biological warfare techniques and the researchers said this work could lead to the development of weapons for a war nobody could win. <PERSON> Christin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anfinsen </PERSON>, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said biotechnology has advanced so rapidly that `` the production of biological weapons is relatively simple.'' `` We could develop warheads to spread anthrax -LRB- disease -RRB- within six months and so could the Soviets,'' said <PERSON> Anfinsen </PERSON>. No nation, he said, could win a war with biological weapons because a counterattack would be swift and deadly. Army Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, confirmed that the military is seeking funds to conduct biological research, but he said the effort is aimed at developing a defense against germ weapons, not at making the weapons themselves. <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said a hearing will be held Monday on the environmental impact of a planned $ 5.4 million biological aerosol test facility at the Dugway Proving Ground in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has let more than 100 biological research contracts to private research groups. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, he said, plans to research defensive measures, such as protective clothing, and detection and decontamination equipment. He said <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> researchers also will attempt to develop vaccines that would protect against germ warfare agents. But he said none of this work was aimed at producing weapons. <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> also said that for germs to be used as weapons, the Army would have to develop a delivery system, a way to manufacture the germs, and a doctrine for the use of such weapons. He said no work is being done in any of these areas. At the scientists' news conference, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a professor of biology at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, said the same techniques needed to develop a defense against biological weapons can be used to develop the weapons themselves. `` In an offensive biological warfare program, the first thing you do is develop a vaccine to protect your own troops,'' he said. King also said the most serious danger of biological weapons is that they could lead to uncontrolled contamination of vast populations if they are released. `` Biological weapons are not like gunpowder or nuclear bombs,'' he said. `` Biological agents can spread and reproduce.'' <PERSON> Anfinsen </PERSON> said new laboratory techniques, in which the genetic pattern of bacteria and viruses can be changed, makes a defense unlikely against germ weapons. `` Since you can make any number of variables, the defense against them is impossible,'' he said. `` The inability to defend against such an attack is universal.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Novick </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said biological weapons are `` neither a threat nor a deterrent'' for major powers because all the technically advanced nations can equally develop such weapons. What he fears instead, <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> said, is that the germ weapons developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> could be used secretly to assert American will in small countries. King and <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> said the Pentagon is actively recruiting biologists to conduct germ warfare research. `` I have been approached and most of us have,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koretz </PERSON>, a researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Rensselaer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said advances in genetic engineering are `` a two-edged sword.'' `` It can be used to improve the quality of human life or it can be used for its destruction,'' she said. Using the new biological techniques to develop weapons, Ms. <PERSON> Koretz </PERSON> said, would be `` a perversion'' of the reasons that most scientists conduct the research. She said genetic manipulation techniques could be used to develop a germ or virus that could spread like small pox. `` You can understand why we are so horrified,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> is circulating a petition among university biologists that contains a pledge not to engage knowingly in research that would further develop biological warfare agents. A day before the news conference, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, announced that the government believes there now are at least 10 countries conducting research into biological weapons.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to hold crucial peace talks with the secretary-general early next week on a cease-fire and a political settlement to end their eight-year war. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire team planned to leave for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> this weekend after <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> finally agreed Friday to accept it. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed earlier to welcome the mission. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> formally protested <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s latest ground offensive and said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> chemical warfare attacks had killed dozens and injured hundreds. On Monday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> finally accepted Resolution 598, the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s year-old plan to end the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted it earlier. Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali-Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and his <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> counterpart <PERSON> Tariz </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> agreed to hold separate, intensive talks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on implementing the plan. After more than a dozen rounds of fruitless <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> talks, this round will be the most crucial, diplomats said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Wednesday he hoped to have a cease-fire in a week or 10 days. It was not immediately known whether the belligerents would hold direct talks, as urged by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>; whether they would hold proximity talks with Perez de Cuellar shuttling between delegations, or whether the talks would take place at different times. Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> might agree to a face-to-face meeting with <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>. Earlier in the week <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> rejected direct talks. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is ready to go along without any limitations whatsover in the implementation of Resolution 598 if the secretary general requires it,'' he said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> says he prefers direct talks, but diplomats said he was not likely to force the issue. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> is expected to be here Monday, and <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> also is expected to arrive early next week. Previously, Iranian envoys from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> refused to be here while ranking <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officials met the secretary-general. The decision by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, militarily battered and politically isolated, to accept a cease-fire was a surprise. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, after a string of battlefield victories, initially called <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s move a trick and said it would accept a cease-fire only after direct talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> came under intense diplomatic pressure from many nations, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, its major arms supplier, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to come to terms quickly and agree to a cease-fire, said informed diplomatic sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. When the secretary-general agreed to call both envoys to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to allow the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire mission to go to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. `` I am very optimistic now because the confusion and misunderstandings have been removed,'' said <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> `` The two foreign ministers will come and discuss with the secretary-general how to get the peace process going full-blast at the technical level and political level. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team will arrive in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on Sunday. The team then planned to travel to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in its week-long mission before reporting back to the secretary-general. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said that after the team returns, he will be able to put Resolution 598 into motion by setting dates for a cease-fire, troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange and formal peace talks and establishing an impartial panel to decide which nation started the war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has insisted that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> must be branded the aggressor. Diplomats say <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> needs international condemnation of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to persuade Iranians to accept a cease-fire. But Resolution 598 is vague on a panel that would determine responsibility for the war, and diplomatic observers said they expected <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to try to undercut that provision. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980 after several border skirmishes. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> technical team will include five officers from the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization based in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers already in both <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and a civilian political officer. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said the cease-fire would be monitored by about 250 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers. But he said funding would be a serious problem for a new <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping or observer force. `` Now that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is engaged in a very major operation, there soon will be a lack of financial stability and, in fact, almost bankruptcy of the organization,'' he said in a statement. `` This will impair very seriously these new operations.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is facing a crisis of unpaid dues, largely because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not paid $ 467 million, or about two-thirds of the total owed to the world organization by its member states.

 Strong tax collections from businesses and individuals are brightening the outlook for reducing the federal budget deficit in 1988, with red ink for the fiscal year through June running 2 percent lower than 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday reported a rare $ 9.5 billion surplus last month, trimming the gap between what the government has spent and what it has taken in during the first nine months of the fiscal year to $ 118 billion, $ 2.4 billion less than during the same period last year. If the deficit continued building at the same rate, it would total $ 147.4 billion when the fiscal year ends Sept. 30, down slightly from the $ 150.4 billion budget gap of last year and substantially below the $ 221.1 billion record high set in 1986. `` Right now it looks like the chances are pretty good that we can beat last year,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasky </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said higher-than-expected collection of individual income taxes in both May and June are making projections earlier this year by private economists of about a $ 160 billion deficit look pessimistic. Quarterly individual tax payments due in June totaled $ 46.2 billion, up 14.1 percent from the same month in 1987. In May, tax payments totaled $ 18 billion, nearly double the collections in May 1987. Corporate tax payments also rose, bolstered by strong profits of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. They totaled $ 18.3 billion in June, 18.6 percent more than the same month a year ago. `` Nobody's really sure, including the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, how this new tax reform law works. My view is that the law actually is collecting taxes that were going into tax shelters, which is what it's supposed to do In 1989, we'll see even more of this,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. The major uncertainty remaining for this year, he said, is how much the government will have to spend to help drought-stricken farmers. Higher grain prices caused by drought-induced shortages could lower government price support payments, but special aid to farmers with shriveled crops could more than make up for that, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said federal spending last month totaled $ 89.9 billion, a 7.7 percent increase over June 1987. However, revenues surged a greater 19.8 percent above last year's level to $ 99.3 billion. It was only the third surplus posted since the fiscal year began in October. There was a surplus in January because Social Security checks for the month were mailed at the end of December and another in April as individual income tax payments poured in. For the first nine months, revenue totaled $ 681.1 billion, up 6.9 percent from last year, while spending was $ 799.1 billion, up 5.5 percent. The administration is forecasting a deficit of $ 146.7 billion, just slightly above the $ 144 billion target in the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law. Next year's target is $ 136 billion. In June, the largest spending category was interest on the national debt, followed by the military, Social Security, and other programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Military spending totaled $ 24.6 billion last month and $ 213.3 billion for the fiscal year so far, up 3.9 percent from the same period a year ago. Spending for Social Security totaled $ 21.3 billion last month and $ 160.8 billion for the past nine months, up 5.6 percent from the same period in the 1987 fiscal year. The other programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid, spent $ 13.7 billion in June and $ 118.7 billion so far this budget year, a 6 percent increase over the first three quarters of fiscal 1987. Interest on the $ 2.5 trillion national debt totaled $ 31.6 billion last month and $ 169.1 billion so far this fiscal year, an increase of 10.2 percent over the same period last year.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has found no basis to investigate former Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> for promoting a former law partner for a judgeship, sources say. The criminal division's public integrity section reached the conclusion after reviewing information about the relationship between <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Summit </PERSON>, who has been nominated to the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and former criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> plan to testify before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday about their March 29 protest resignations. They quit out of concern that the continued tenure of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was hurting <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> operations and morale. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times disclosed <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' support for Summit last month, suggesting the former deputy attorney general might have violated federal conflict-of-interest law. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times this month disclosed that <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> had been the focus of an internal <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation into whether he smoked marijuana at a wedding in 1982. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> has emphatically denied the allegation, made in an anonymous letter, and the department's Office of Professional Responsibility closed the matter. Congressional sources and sources close to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have said the leaking of unfavorable information about <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> has been an attempt to discourage them from testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> was still receiving payments from the law firm and had investments in limited partnerships with Summit at the time he was urging Summit's nomination last year.

<HEAD>Shultz Helps Israel Settle Soviet Jews</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has decided to help <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> hold on to Soviet Jews who might prefer settling in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. He will not oppose a prospective change in Israeli procedures designed to stem the exodus to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of Jews who left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with exit permits for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the officials said Friday. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is likely to heed the advice of the bureaus that handle Soviet and refugee affairs and keep pushing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to permit wider emigration across the board. Most Jews who leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are permitted to depart if they can get visas from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Once they reach <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, the transit point for Soviet emigres, nearly 90 percent of them go elsewhere, mostly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and are taken in by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as refugees. Concerned about the situation, the Israeli Cabinet has ordered a change in procedures. Soviet Jews granted exit permits would receive their Israeli visas in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and fly to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The change in procedure, which has not been put into effect, would make it harder for Soviet Jews to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because they would have to qualify for entry as immigrants. This could require long waiting periods and most would be fenced out for various reasons as ineligible. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s European bureau, which is involved in Soviet policy, and the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> had both recommended to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that he urge <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to change its policy and appeal to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to permit wider emigration. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanitarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, proposed that Soviet Jews remain eligible for admission to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as refugees even after they reach <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Near Eastern bureau, which deals in Arab and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> affairs, recommended to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that he not contest the Israeli Cabinet's decision _ advice he will follow, at least temporarily, according to officials who spoke on the condition they not be identified. `` The debate is less a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> debate than a debate about feeling the Israelis would be insulted and that it would undermine the purpose of the State of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if refugees left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and did not go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' an official said. `` They need and want immigrants.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> representative of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, described the problem as `` one of the hottest and most complex issues in <LOCATION> Israeli-Diaspora </LOCATION> debate.'' He referred to divergent views among Jews living in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and elsewhere around the world. `` Ideally,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said, `` the compromise would be a two-track policy. Soviet Jews who want to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would leave the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> with Israeli visas. Those seeking resettlement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would leave with American visas. It is our hope the administration will press the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> in this direction. It's fair, it's equitable, its logical.'' Most Soviet citizens are unable to obtain exit permits. But thousands of Jews, Armenians and ethnic Germans over the years have enjoyed a special privilege of emigrating. Very small numbers of Jews are permitted to go directly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The others can leave only if they obtain visas for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Forgotten Italian Fashion Designers Fight Back with Frills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIELA PETROFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Italian high fashion designers presented the most ornate collections in many a season for this fall and winter, perhaps in an effort to give a lift to their own sagging image. During the five-day Roman fashion week ending Friday night, the couture runway brimmed with gold, silver, bronze and precious stones. Sequined embroidery, no longer flatly stitched, stood out in three-dimensional flora and fauna, while precious pelts of mink, sable and fox rimmed cuffs, collars and hemlines. The great success achieved by French designer <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>, coupled with a power struggle between <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for control of the Italian fashion scene, has weakened the image of the made-in-Italy couture label, which in the 1960s presented a real threat to the supremacy of French couture. Today, only a handful of buyers and press representatives come to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for the twice-a-year showings, mainly to check in at <LOCATION> Valentino </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON>, the popular Milanese ready-to-wear designer that began its high fashion collections two years ago. <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> tries to put its best foot forward by using elegant hotels and historic outdoor settings for its shows. They contrast sharply with <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> trade fairgrounds, where the Italian ready-to-wear shows are held, and Parisian tents, where French collections are displayed. Although individual houses such as <LOCATION> Lancetti </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mila </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Galitzine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Laug </PERSON> have a long list of faithful clients, the Valentino couture label is the only one that can still give the French a run for their money. The look for the fall-winter Italian style is vaguely Russian, with sable playing heavily for day and night on hats, coats, jackets, sweaters and evening gowns. Redingote coat styles abound, as well as wide lapels on jackets and high collars on dresses and blouses alike. Shades tend toward fall greens, purples and browns. Flannel gray makes a big comeback, and the newest shade of the season is ruby red, championed by <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> in his much applauded collection. In a situation emblematic of their unsettled state, the designers could not agree on one hemline, with some diving way below the knee, while others still offered short skirts. However, the tiny miniskirt is out, and the preferred length is right on the knee. Although not prominent, pants dot the collections, with <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> offering the newest idea: gray flannel man-tailored trousers by night worn with a sumptuous sequined top. Heels are very high, makeup is pronounced with bright red lips, and hairstyles are neat, often pinned back at the neck. For evening wear, the designers let themselves go, often tailoring their gowns from shimmering gold, silver or bronze fabrics and decorating an otherwise simple sheath with heavy jeweled sequins or entire life-sized floral arrangements of fabric and sequins. And if that's not enough, fur trimming is sometimes added for extra winter warmth. With prices for a couture gown starting at $ 10, OOO and soaring over $ 100,000 for more elaborate models, it is understandable that the designers are eager to give the client her money's worth. However, the look can and often does fall into fashion kitsch. Only <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> were able to carry this opulence off gracefully. <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> unburdened his floral-sequined and fur-trimmed silver gray ballgown by interspersing its layers of velvet and taffeta with yards and yards of airy tulle. <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> streamlined the look by relegating ornate sequins to cummerbunds on a simple chiffon gown and fashioning his floral creations out of bands of satin.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ Extension of the life of the Iran-Contra grand jury will push the 18-month-old investigation into the start of the next president's term with more charges possible. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Chief Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> acted Friday, just six days before the jury was to be disbanded, to extend its work for six more months, through Jan. 27, 1989. By then, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor will be in office. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, in his order, responded to a sealed motion from independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to extend the inquiry, even as <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s staff prepares for the scheduled Sept. 20 opening of the trial of former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Lawyers for <PERSON> North </PERSON> have asked that the trial be postponed until March 1989. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is expected to continue looking into the activities of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and others in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> following the indictment last month of a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. An unspecified number of co-conspirators were cited along with <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> in an illegal supply network aimed at getting funds to the Contras in 1986, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s order said the purpose of the extension was `` for the investigations identified by the government in its motion.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieghart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s spokesman, said he could not comment on specifics of the planned investigations mentioned in the judge's order <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation previously focused on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fund-raising efforts for the Contras, arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of profits from the sales to the rebels. This led to charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> for their roles in the Iranian arms sales and the diversion of profits from the sales to private use and to the Contras. Two fund-raisers and former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> earlier pleaded guilty to other charges resulting from <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s grand jury investigation. The charges against <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> accused him of helping <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> coordinate air drops of weapons and supplies to <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> groups in 1986. Trials of <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> will follow that of North. On Tuesday, <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to have their indictments dismissed because they believe testimony given to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> under grants of immunity would be used against them in the trials.

<TEXT>
 Eighteen business and professional organizations urged <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s governing and main opposition parties to end political violence between their supporters. The call to sign a peace agreement came after backers of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> stoned a busload of <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> supporters in a fishing village Sunday. Pro-government militants then burned several shacks and chased one opposition party member into the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, where he drowned. `` In a climate of violence and lawlessness, the entire nation suffers from a drying up of investment and a decline in tourism and other economic activity,'' read a joint statement issued Friday by the 18 private sector groups. Several others were injured in separate attacks during the week between rival bands of the two parties. More than 700 people died in political violence during the 1980 general elections. `` The signing of a joint declaration by the leaders and the public commitment of their parties to law and order can no longer be delayed for whatever reason,'' read the statement, which asked that the agreement be signed by Aug. 1, Independence Day. Elections are expected in December, but <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s Constitution grants the prime minister a three-month grace period before calling new elections. Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> was elected for a five-year term in 1983. `` We believe we speak for the law-abiding majority of this country in saying we are sick of ... the violence and partisan point-scoring and are disappointed by our political leaders' delay in fulfilling their national duty,'' the statement read. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, a former prime minister and the opposition leader, said Wednesday his party is ready to sign the agreement. `` <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> is demanding that both political parties work together to bring the madness of political violence to an end,'' he said. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Golding </PERSON>, chairman of the governing party, said the parties must have the political will to end the violence before signing a peace pact.

 A chemical company in eastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> mistakenly sold a restaurant a lethal chemical compound instead of baking soda, and five diners died of poisoning and 140 others became ill, a newspaper reported today. The Peasant Daily said the people were poisoned June 23 after a chemical company in <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> province sold the restaurant sodium fluosilicate rather than sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda. Sodium fluosilicate is used in insecticides and ceramics. Customers who bought the restaurant's buns containing the poisonous chemical suffered from serious stomach pains, vomiting and diarrhea, the report said. It said the person in charge of the warehouse at the chemical company was arrested after being found responsible for the mistake.

<HEAD>Sugar Quota Will Benefit 39 Countries, Brings Praise From U.S.
Sugar Users</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ A 40 percent increase in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar quota will benefit the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and 36 other countries and is bringing praise from large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar users. The increase in what had been the lowest sugar quotas in 113 years authorizes the purchase of 300,000 additional short tons of sugar in 1988 and also reallocates the 20,300 tons of sugar that would have been bought from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> before all trade with that country was cut off. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the office of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative announced the sugar quota expansion to 1,056,675 tons at the end of the trading day Friday. The new quota is about 56,000 tons higher than the 1987 figure but lower than the 1986 quota of 1.7 million tons. The 1988 quota previously had been the lowest since 1875, agriculture and trade officials said. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, who has advocated a scrapping of the program that keeps <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar prices higher than those on the world market, said the increase was necessary because of unexpected cuts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production, `` including the likely effects of the drought on sugar beet yields.'' The low sugar quotas announced last December had brought criticism from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar users who anticipated difficulty getting enough sugar and disappointment in countries whose quotas were cut _ particularly the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, which has long been dependent upon the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar quotas to help its ailing economy. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar program offers a kind of dual subsidy, helping the producing countries by paying well above world market prices for their sugar and helping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar growers by guaranteeing them the higher prices, too. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> buys sugar under the quota system at the same price it pays <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers, about 23 cents a pound, up from 18 cents earlier this year. The current world market price is approaching 15 cents a pound after dipping to around 6 cents. Under the new quotas, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> will be able to sell 176,710 short tons, up from 123,200; the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> 158,640, up from 110,600; and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> 145,590, up from 101,500. Those three countries account for almost half of the foreign sugar sold to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last December when the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> set the low quotas, officials said the cuts were justified because of decreased consumption with Americans using more artificial and other natural sweeteners. The program is designed to guarantee <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers a high price for their sugar and is also favored by producers of artificial sweeteners because they also can charge higher prices. Critics include manufacturers who use a lot of sugar in their products, because it keeps sugar prices high. But sugar users were pleased with the new quotas. `` We applaud the secretary of agriculture,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sweetener </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Users </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents companies that use sugar. `` It will stop the inflationary spiral that was going on with domestic sugar prices,'' he said. <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said the need was `` immediate and urgent because my members ... believe that without it, adequate supplies of sugar by late summer and fall were very much in doubt.'' Except for the elimination of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s quota, the share of sugar purchases allocated to each country will not change. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said the new quota includes a base import quota of 975,000 tons and 2,000 tons of specialty sugar. The new allocations raised the minimum quota from 5,770 tons to 8,000. It was the first mid-year increase in the sugar quota since April 5, 1984, when there was a shortfall in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar cane production.

<TEXT>
 A minister active in the civil rights movement was found beaten to death Friday in his church hours after he returned from the Democratic convention, and police charged a nearby resident with murder. The Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesby </PERSON>, 61, who headed the branch of Operation PUSH in this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb, was killed with a `` large, sharp instrument,'' <LOCATION> Kane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> said. Associates described <PERSON> Wesby </PERSON> as a longtime friend or colleague of Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, founder of Chicago-based Operation PUSH. <PERSON> Wesby </PERSON> was not listed as a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate, but had apparently gone to the convention to support <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wesby </PERSON>'s body was found shortly before 10 a.m., about two hours after he returned from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who was answering telephones at his <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, about 35 miles west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wesby </PERSON> founded the church 25 years ago. Late Friday night, police acting on a tip arrested <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 28, at his home about two blocks from the church and charged him with murder, said police Capt. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatus </PERSON>. He said police were still trying to determine a motive for the slaying. The suspect is black, as was the victim. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> was scheduled for a bond hearing Saturday, <PERSON> Beatus </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wesby </PERSON> died immediately after being attacked.

 Hordes of thirsty ants driven by drought and heat are invading homes throughout the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area in search of water, and residents say no one seems to know how to stop them. `` I've never seen anything like it. There are millions of them,'' said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Novato </LOCATION>. `` I've almost cried.'' The ants are climbing out of light switches, creeping into baby bottles and even making their way into freezers. `` They are getting into bed with people. When you turn on the water, they come out of the faucet in globs. People finding themselves taking baths with ants,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolbert </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Novato </LOCATION>. Experts say the tiny insects are only looking for water for their bone-dry nests, but unsympathetic human hosts are calling exterminators. `` It is really, really bad this year, and it's creating hysteria,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendergraft </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Exterminators in <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. More than 150 calls have come in each day since last weekend, when temperatures soared to record highs, he said. `` The county is going under with all the ants,'' <PERSON> Wolbert </PERSON> said. `` People have called in who have n't had ants for 20 years. They have them all over the house.'' Even ant fans wish the ants would march somewhere else. As a scientist, <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Fouche </PERSON> admires ants as `` survivalists,'' but as a homeowner, he's being driven crazy by the insects' persistence <PERSON> Fouche </PERSON>, a research associate in urban entomology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, looks for nests in the yard of his <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cerrito </ORGANIZATION> home but admits he's probably wasting his time. `` Unless you get the queen, I can almost guarantee that the ants will out-persevere you. They'll just keep coming,'' he said. `` The colony needs food and water. They have thousands of workers who will sacrifice themselves.'' If they were n't so good at surviving, they would n't have defied `` all the pest control people in the bay area,'' <PERSON> Fouche </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wolbert </PERSON> called the situation `` just another result of nature changing'' and said a similar problem occurred during the 1977 drought. `` They just have to set up a happy home. They need water and a little food,'' he said. `` If you have food in your pantry or water in your sinks, you're going to have them.'' <PERSON> Wolbert </PERSON> said he could n't understand all the uproar: `` It's really phenomenal Ants are very clean. They're always preening each other.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Grippi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Novato </LOCATION> did n't share his complacency. `` It feels like it's been a disaster,'' she said, adding that ants had surrounded her home and invaded an upstairs bathroom. `` They make me crazy.''

 A Libyan man accused of gathering information about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> intelligence operatives and arranging for the military training of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dissidents in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has been ordered held without bail. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate on Friday granted bail to five other defendants, including <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawamda </PERSON>, a travel agency owner accused of involvement in an alleged <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> plot to assassinate a `` high government official in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Sources have said the official was former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who played a key role in the 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The prosecution immediately appealed the bail for <PERSON> Hawamda </PERSON>, a naturalized American described by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as a senior Libyan intelligence operative, and he was ordered held pending an appeals hearing early next week. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in today's editions, quoted <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying there is little evidence to support a federal prosecutor's assertion that <PERSON> Hawamda </PERSON> may have helped in the alleged plot. The Times said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> officials who asked not to be identified said they were baffled when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> asserted in open court earlier this week that Hawamda should be held without bail because he was a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> intelligence officer who may have assisted in a plot to kill a government official. The officials, who asked not to be identified, said that while there may have been an assassination plot aimed at North, the only information linking <PERSON> Hawamda </PERSON> to such a conspiracy came from an informer whose reliabiity is uncertain. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had no comment on the assertions that there was little evidence to support allegations about the assassination plot, the Times said. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, the lawyer representing <PERSON> Hawamda </PERSON>, called the prosecution's contention of a plot to kill a high government official `` ludicrous.'' <PERSON> Hawamda </PERSON> and the five others were among eight men arrested Wednesday on suspicion of a scheme to illegally use Libyan government funds to solicit support for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> among American dissidents, including Indians and Black Muslims. Friday's hearing before magistrate <PERSON> Leonie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkema </PERSON> was to determine whether the six would be freed on bond. The bail ranged from $ 250,000 for <LOCATION> Hawamda </LOCATION> to $ 10,000 for Manhal <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON>, a Moroccan who worked for Hawamda. Two other defendants are being held in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, a criminal lawyer from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> who represented four of the defendants in court, said the case was `` very political. <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, a criminal lawyer who represented <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> child murderer <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> in 1982, said the prosecution had made `` allegations with no concrete evidence.'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> told reporters after the detention hearing that `` the case involves issues far beyond just a diversion of funds.'' But he refused to elaborate, saying additional charges would be made when indictments are returned, possibly late next week. Speaking for the prosecution, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> special agent <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartnik </PERSON> said the defendant held without bail, <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Rajhi </PERSON>, was a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> intelligence operative who in June 1987 was ordered to gather the names and addresses of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials dealing with the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> region. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> seized a document handwritten by <PERSON> Al-Rajhi </PERSON> as a cover letter for a computer list of intelligence operatives, <PERSON> Bartnik </PERSON> said. The list and letter were sent to the head of Libyan intelligence, <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Madjoub </PERSON>, he added. <PERSON> Al-Rajhi </PERSON> also wrote <PERSON> Madjoub </PERSON> a memo which indicated the Libyans had promised to fund American dissident groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and pay for their military training in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bartnik </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' announcement that it would lay off 4,000 employees and eliminate service to 14 cities to cut costs was met with bitterness and fear by workers, who should learn their fate by Monday. `` I've heard rumors this way since I've been working here,'' said <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a ticket agent at <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> who has been with Eastern for 11 years. `` It's always been felt, but now it's real.'' The plan announced Friday by the loss-plagued airline would trim 12 percent of the work force and eliminate service to the 14 cities on Aug. 31. Included among the layoffs or early retirements will be 520 jobs in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, 300 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and 350 in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, which will no longer be the carrier's Western hub, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said. The reductions also will include 1,100 jobs from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area, including 600 at a reservations center in <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and 500 flight attendants, pilots and managers based at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> airports. Last November, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> eliminated 3,500 jobs, mostly from the company's union ranks. `` We are preserving the airline. We're strengthening the airline. I do n't care to place the blame anywhere,'' Bakes said, citing high operating costs and increased competition for Eastern's huge losses But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, chairman of the 3,500-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> contingent at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, disagreed. `` They've done nothing over the past two years except squeeze the assets out of Eastern in order to help subsidize our sister airline, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Both Eastern and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> are subsidiaries of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which lost $ 466 million last year. The announcement came in the seventh month of bitter contract talks between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which is seeking raises for 10,000 Eastern workers. The carrier is seeking $ 161 million in pay cuts and other concessions. The Miami-based airline also is seeking $ 69 million in concessions from its pilots union, which began formal contract talks with the company Friday. `` Last year, we lost $ 182 million. In essence, Eastern is returning to its basic roots in an attempt to regain strength in the marketplace,'' Bakes said. Eastern's operations in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> will be the core of the carrier's service, he said. The 14 cities being cut are <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb; <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; Pointe-a-Pitre, <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The personnel cuts will involve both union and non-union members and management personnel, <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said. The reductions will reduce the work force to 29,500, down from 43,300 in September 1986. The airline said the work force reduction would allow it to sell a proportional share of its fleet, cutting the number of planes it operates from 246 to 202 in the fall. Machinists local chief <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> was en route to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and could not be reached Friday. Earlier this week, after word of the impending cuts leaked, he said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would have `` no credibility'' and said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was `` evil.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union is seeking a two-year contract with raises of 1.5 percent and 5 percent, which <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> says will cost $ 50 million yearly. Employees were shocked by the news of the layoffs, said a reservation operator in <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` A lot of us have 10 or 15 years seniority and now we're going to be looking for other jobs,'' said the woman, who would only identify herself as <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON>. `` There's a lot of crying going on.''

The pilgrims, who came from more than 130 countries, have converged on Mecca for the annual hajj rituals, one of the five sacraments that any able Moslem is required to perform once a lifetime. Government-run Saudi radio quoted an unidentified official source as saying the Iranian report, along with a similar Iranian report on Wednesday, was `` made up.'' The source said it was one of a series of `` lies and fabrications'' broadcast by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to create tension. He said pilgrims in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> were undertaking their rites `` in calm and secure conditions.'' Residents in the <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> area reached by telephone from <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> said they were not aware of any violence. They said pilgrims prayed early Saturday in preparation for the culmination of the pilgrimage. Other residents reached in <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION> also said they had heard no reports of violence. `` Hundreds of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Turk </LOCATION>, Afghan, Pakistani and American pilgrims demonstrated in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> today -LRB- Friday -RRB-, chanting slogans ... and carrying placards condemning the <PERSON> Al-Saud </PERSON> regime in their killing of over 400 pilgrims of the holy sanctuary last year in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said. It added: `` According to received reports, the Saudi regime's police ... subjected the demonstrators to severe control and surrounded them In some sections, they attacked the ranks of the marchers.'' During last year's pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION>, 402 people were killed in riots. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> said the pilgrims, 275 of them Iranians, died in a stampede. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed Saudi police shot them. The Saudis accused the Iranians of holding demonstrations, including anti-U.S. protests, in defiance of a ban on political activity. Last April, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> broke off diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, citing terrorism and subversion. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has been receiving the pilgrims and organizing the hajj this year with extensive security measures to prevent a recurrence of last year's violence. The official <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said thousands of worshipers gathered inside the Grand Mosque Friday, in its expansive courtyard or on its roof. The roof alone has a capacity of 80,000 people, the agency said. After the Friday prayers at the mosque, which harbors the <LOCATION> Kaaba </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s most sacred shrine _ the worshipers moved three miles away to <PERSON> Mina </PERSON>. Pilgrims spend the rest of the day in <LOCATION> Mina </LOCATION> praying in preparation for the culmination of hajj on Saturday. The agency reported the temperature in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION>, was 111 degrees. <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION> is the kingdom's capital. Saturday, the ninth day of the month of Zhul-Hijja by Islamic calendar, is earmarked as `` Wukuf,'' or the day of standing, when pilgrims wake at dawn and travel another six miles to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, where they remain praying, chanting and listening to sermons. Saturday night is spent at <LOCATION> Muzdalifa </LOCATION>, about four miles away, where pebbles are thrown in a ritual stoning of the devil. At dawn Sunday, sheep are slaughtered in sacrifice and the hajj ends for the hundreds of thousands who have come by air, sea and land. A four-day Eid al-Adha or Feast of Sacrifice, then follows throughout the Moslem world. It is the biggest religious congregation on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, and reports from <PERSON> Mecca </PERSON> said traffic was moving smoothly but slowly Friday. Thousands of vehicles, mainly buses, coasters and jeeps were used to transport the pilgrims, although thousands preferred to move on foot, according to the reports. The director general of passports administration, Gen. <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sherif </PERSON>, told the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> news agency that 762,755 pilgrims arrived from abroad as of Monday. The foreigners, who included Moslem heads of state, premiers and ministers, joined about half a million more from within <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. These include worshipers and thousands who come to provide services, including about 20,000 security men, according to diplomatic sources. The Iranians boycotted this year's pilgrimage when <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> sought to reduce the numbers f pilgrims, citing massive renovations at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and neighboring <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, which harbors the tomb of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. Pilgrims visit <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> after the hajj formally ends. Iranians have urged other Moslems to take control of Mecca from the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> rulers, who are its custodians. Iranian television reported demonstrations took place but Saudi authorities denied that.

 Weddings and soccer games still stir Iraqis' Arab zeal for celebration, and a religious holiday can be a time of great feasting. But Iraqis are showing an uncharacteristic lack of jubilation over <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s agreement to halt its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. For people like <PERSON> Suad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>, the war will end only when her family is reunited. `` I really want the guns to fall silent and for my dear husband to come home,'' said the 34-year-old mother of three, whose husband has been in the army since the war began. `` When the Iranians said they would accept the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- cease-fire -RRB- resolution, I really thought the war was finally over, but it seems now it will take weeks and probably months before he will be back,'' she said. Such war-weary wariness has been common in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed Monday to accept a truce. `` There was nothing. No reaction,'' said a European diplomat who was in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> on Monday. Iraqis seem deeply suspicious of the Iranian decision, and the government is insisting any truce be tied to a final settlement. Parades, celebrations and television specials typically greet Iraqi victories in battle. None followed the Iranian announcement. Official news media and President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have encouraged caution and continued vigilance by the military. The army has continued to fight, and it said Thursday night it had recaptured 33 northern hills lost to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the early days of the war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Iraqi units penetrated 12 miles into its territory Friday and claimed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons. Exultation is common here over much less than the end of a long and costly war. Fusillades of tracer bullets lit the night sky over <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> defeated rival <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in the Arab soccer championship Thursday night. Wedding parties toot car horns and bang drums as they move through the streets of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. Families are buying sheep to slaughter for the Eid al-Adha feast that marks the end of <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s season of pilgrimage to Mecca. The date depends on the moon, but it is expected Sunday or Monday. Celebration of the war's end, however, apparently will have to wait for a final peace. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> say distrust of the Iranians, who accepted a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution they had rejected since its passage a year ago, is rooted in hundreds of years of conflict between <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Government officials also feel <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> may want a truce only as a respite in which to rebuild their army, which has lost several battles this year. Some cite Iranian statements that a cease-fire does not mean the end of the war, which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> sees as a crusade for his own vision of Islam. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> rejected proposals of a cease-fire two years ago when its own forces were being battered near the southern city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and many observers felt collapse was near. It would `` certainly not'' accept a truce without real peace now that it has the upper hand militarily, said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat who recently talked with Iraqi officials. He said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> insists on direct peace talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as a sign `` of serious purpose.'' A European diplomat said Iraqis are `` still going to be nervous about the Iranians because the Iranians have n't been beaten'' and still are ruled by crusading clerics. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` could be militarily quite potent ... within a year or two.'' Although they are not celebrating, ordinary Iraqis are anxious for the war to end. `` I am an old man,'' said 68-year-old <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON> at the counter of his auto parts store. `` I have been running the shop for four years, since my elder son was conscripted. I am very tired and I want him back to the shop and with the family.''

 It's over, and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is happy. City and business officials praised their city and the publicity it received during the four-day Democratic National Convention, which ended Thursday. `` The awareness of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is at an all-time high throughout the world, and that will translate into investment decisions in future months,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, commissioner of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said Gov. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> plans a business-hunting trip to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> this fall, `` and we will not have to explain to anybody we meet with where <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is, and that's the big benefit of the convention as far as we were concerned.'' Many Americans are `` still in the mindset -LRB- that <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is -RRB- ` Gone With the Wind,''' said <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwozan </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the novel and film about the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> during the Civil War. But, she said, `` I think they now have an excellent picture of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in 1988 _ a progressive, exciting city.'' Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, also pleased with the city in its role as host, plugged <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as a site for future major events. `` I would hope that we have received the kind of good coverage around the world that will convince the Olympic Committee that we really know how to put on a party,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said Friday. The city is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nominee to be host of the 1996 Summer Games. Live broadcasts during the convention by network morning television shows, which originated in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, were particularly helpful in dispelling myths, Ms. <PERSON> Dwozan </PERSON> said. Those programs showed `` <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is a metropolitan city, with a fabulous skyline, a lot of Fortune 500 companies,'' she said, and people already have begun calling, wanting more information. The callers say, `` Gosh, I never had any idea y' all had all that down there, so can you send me a packet? Pre-convention studies estimated the convention would bring between $ 58.7 million and $ 64.3 million into the city, which spent $ 15 million to stage it. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Dwozan </PERSON> estimated that the direct economic impact was about what had been predicted, but they stressed the short-term gain was not their goal. The city already is a major convention town, Ms. <PERSON> Dwozan </PERSON> said, so the hope is that tourism will increase and businesses will look closer at moving to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> because of interest generated by the convention. Ms. <PERSON> Dwozan </PERSON> said convention bureau President <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON> estimates the city received about $ 1 billion worth of `` media awareness'' worldwide. `` We could never have afforded an advertising campaign like that.'' `` For the most part,'' she said, `` <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was accurately portrayed. Some of the stories that were negative were accurate. `` <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is not perfect. We do have things that need improving and some of the stories touched on that. All in all, we're thrilled. The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> had set as a particular goal keeping the 15,000 reporters in town informed about the city and trying to make it easy for them to work, hoping the city would look good. `` In that, we overwhelmingly achieved that objective,'' said chamber spokesman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. `` It was great, it was fantastic exposure: a little bit of the good, a little bit of the not-so-good. `` Nobody really zinged us badly,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` The city performed fantastically. Hospitality was truly gracious in all respects. Police and security people were outstanding. They looked good. The demonstrators got their point across. `` We could n't have bought this kind of exposure,'' he said.

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> launched their general election campaign Friday with a trip to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s home turf and a promise that `` We're going to make every American a shareholder in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream.'' About 1,000 supporters endured blazing heat to greet the Democratic ticket on an airport tarmac here, adjacent to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s hometown of Mission `` I do n't want to kid you,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` This is going to be a tough race.'' A Mexican band played, and both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, perspiring in the July heat, addressed the crowd in both English and Spanish. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' command of Spanish helped him win <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in the Super Tuesday primary. `` You know how important <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is going to be to us. And we need your help,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told residents of the state also claimed as home by the certain <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I know what you did on Super Tuesday for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. You can do it again.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said `` What we have seen on the part of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a reaching out, a bringing in,'' of all segments of society. The pair met briefly with reporters. Asked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s characterization of his acceptance speech as negative and non-specific, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied `` Well, he's an expert on both subjects.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> then headed to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> for another rally, after which they traveled to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for the night. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was greeted at the <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, airport by a large crowd, some of whom said they had waited as long as two hours to catch a glimpse of he Democratic nominee. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stood with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, their arms upraised, at a rally surrounded by the city's skyscrapers before a crowd of about 3,000 people. `` The Republicans are confused,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` They do n't know what to make of this ticket And they're worried, let me tell you. Because they know we're not going to concede one single state of the 50 to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> this fall.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was to accompany <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> throughout a five-state, coast-to-coast swing through the weekend. Aboard their plane were several members of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressional delegation and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, the state treasurer who delivered the Democratic keynote address in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last Monday night. Enroute to <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> noted that the community is in the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, an area suffering unemployment of `` 25, 30, 35 percent.'' `` We're going to make every American a shareholder in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream _ that's what this campaign is all about,'' he said. Earlier, former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> an enthusiastic sendoff from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> before a crowd of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention delegates. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called on his supporters to provide the ticket with the same `` street heat'' that led to civil rights gains in the 1960s. He said they needed to find millions of new voters for the November election. `` We've got to keep on that street heat ... enough heat for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to get out of the kitchen,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` The stakes are very high,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said before leaving <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where he accepted the Democratic nomination Thursday night. `` We ca n't take another four years of what we've been going through for the last eight.'' The campaign stakes in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are the third highest in the country. It trails only <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in electoral votes with 29 and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is counting on <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to put those in the Democratic column. The senior senator's personal popularity in the Lone Star State is solid and his fund-raising ability unparalleled. He first won the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 by defeating then-Congressman <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and has been re-elected twice since, netting 60 percent of the vote in 1982, and he's staying on the ballot again this year. <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was the next stop after the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> visit, where the ticket will be eyeing <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s top prize of 41 electoral votes. The swing back East will take them through <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and then a rally in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, fourth with 25 votes in the electoral college. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides said the trip was designed to demonstrate their intent to battle in every state, conceding none to the Republicans. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his audience gave a polite reception to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the more conservative half of the ticket. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> might be what the <ORGANIZATION> Democatic </ORGANIZATION> party ticket needed now. `` He represents a wing. We represent a wing,'' he said. `` It takes two wings to fly.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> compared <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> with <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who was viewed with skepticism by blacks but who `` rose to the occasion'' and became a force behind the civil rights legislation when he became president. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also needled <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, implying that people should vote for him for president to get him out of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` In practical terms ... it means the Contras have lost a vote.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> applauded <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s remarks and recited for the group his own record on civil rights. He asked for their support, saying `` indifference is not an option in 1988,'' and at the end received a standing ovation.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has developed a plan that would give each nation unprecedented access to each other's bomber bases, strategic naval ports and military ships as a way of verifying constraints on cruise missiles, according to a report published today. The Washington Post, quoting Soviet officials, reported the proposal calls for permanently stationing teams of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet inspectors outside factories where cruise missiles are produced, where their warheads are installed and where the weapons are loaded onto submarines and other ships. It also calls for periodic inspection of military bases where long-range aircraft are equipped with cruise missiles, and short-notice inspections of unrelated sites where cruise missiles are strongly suspected of being illegally stored. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> plan was outlined in interviews with <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s disarmament chief, and Col. Gen. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON>, senior arms control adviser on the Soviet general staff. According to <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON>, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> still wants to sign an agreement with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sharply cutting strategic offensive nuclear arms and incorporating these inspection rights to verify each side's compliance. But the Soviet officials said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration thus far has blocked the plan because of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> resistance to proposed Soviet inspections. They called on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to `` make a political decision'' in the next six weeks to overrule the military or see his hopes for agreement dashed. `` This is a two-way process,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> as saying. `` We are not happy about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -LRB- inspection -RRB- personnel on our submarines. But if we are serious -LRB- about controlling arms -RRB-, then we should agree on inspections of anything.''

<HEAD>Anglicans Debate Ordination Of Women Priests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five men and a woman dueled politely over the divisive issue of women priests at the world conference of 525 Anglican bishops. Three came out against women priests or urged caution and two were in favor, with <ORGANIZATION> Archbishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Runcie </ORGANIZATION> holding an advisory role at panel discussions on Friday. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> is leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, whose leaders are tackling the question at the Lambeth Conference, held every 10 years. The 525 bishops attending are from 164 countries. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> recalled that the 1978 conference agreed that the decisions of any of the 27 self-governing churches should be respected by the others, whether they agreed or not. But since then, he said, `` matters are not what they were.'' He referred to the ordination of more than 1,200 women priests and more than 1,400 women deacons, priestly assistants who can conduct baptisms, marriages and funerals but not Holy Communion. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> says the Anglican Communion could break up if a woman bishop is consecrated, a step now being considered by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalians and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> Anglicans. He said opposing male bishops would not feel in communion with a woman bishop, thereby sundering traditional links within the church. The Rev. <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Peete </PERSON>, who was ordained in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and now works in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Archbishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peers </ORGANIZATION> spoke out strongly in favor of admitting women to the priesthood. Ms. <PERSON> Peete </PERSON> told the bishops that under her leadership, her congregation in All Saints parish increased fund-raising and activity to help the homeless. In her city, `` Episcopal priests as well as Roman Catholic priests and sisters seek me out for spiritual direction,'' Ms. <PERSON> Peete </PERSON> said. Peers said Canadian Anglicans have ordained women priests since 1976. He said women now enrich the clergy `` in a way that had not been so before'' and `` they promise to enrich our lives.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalians and the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> have ordained 1,163 of the 1,269 women admitted to the priesthood by a quarter of the world's Anglican churches. The majority still refuse women priests. Anglicans are the world's second largest body of Christians, after the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The bishop of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, the leading opponent of women priests and bishops in the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, Anglicanism's mother church, said women priests already had impaired communion He said people had left the Anglican church in some places where women have been ordained. `` Much greater impairment will inevitably take place if women are consecrated to the episcopate,'' he said. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> listed 10 `` profound concerns'' of the opponents of women priests and bishops. The foremost are that God chose to embody himself in a man, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>; and that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> chose 12 men for his apostles. A Palestinian, Presiding Bishop <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafity </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, said it was only natural to consider women priests when there are women scientists, judges and political leaders. But he said Roman Catholics were firmly against women priests and bishops and that the Orthodox churches also objected. So `` those who seek the unity of <LOCATION> Christendom </LOCATION> must take this fact into consideration,'' <PERSON> Kafity </PERSON> said. Archbishop of Brisbane <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Grindrod </PERSON>, Primate of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, stressed the dangers to the Anglican Communion of consecrating a woman bishop. He said it might be necessary to appoint a special group to produce guidelines for women's ordination if the conference did not have time.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office is investigating allegations that a former campaign volunteer for Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, R-Wash., made threatening and harassing telephone calls to syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> from the congressman's home, according to police The calls were believed to be related to an incident on June 14 in which <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, an outspoken gun-control advocate, shot a teen-age intruder in his back yard, said <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police. He said <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> reported to the security branch of the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Potomac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the police that `` a series of threatening and harassing phone calls'' were made to his home between July 1 and July 14. `` This is such a shock,'' commented <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, about the investigation focusing on one-time campaign helper <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. No charges have been filed against <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, but the case has been handed over to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, where a decision will be made whether to prosecute. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> worked for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> during the congressman's 1984 campaign, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. `` He periodically house-sat, and he's been doing it a lot lately,'' she said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and his wife, June, recently had a baby, and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> has been traveling to his home state to visit his spouse, leaving <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in the house alone, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> Friday to apologize. `` He said that he and June are appalled at <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'s action and that there is absolutely no explanation for it,'' she said, adding that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> `` is not now nor ever has been on Congressman <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s staff Never.'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, reached at his home Friday, said, `` I have no comment about anything.'' Following the shooting incident, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> told authorities that he shot <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 18, with a .22 - caliber handgun after hearing noises in his back <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said he called police and discovered <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON>, 19, and two other unidentified youths by his back yard pool. The District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s strict handgun ordinance requires that all weapons be registered, but <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> told authorities that the gun had belonged to his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> claimed that his son was told he did not have to register the weapon after leaving the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> officials have not yet decided whether to prosecute <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> on weapons charges.

<HEAD>Iran Trying To Stir Unrest In Holy City, Saudi Arabia Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> today said thousands of Moslems were making a calm and peaceful pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of spreading false reports of violence and unrest to stir tensions in the holy city. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said hundreds of pilgrims demonstrated in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> on Friday against the deaths last year of 402 people in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, and that police attacked some demonstrators. Parts of the report by the government-run Iranian radio, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, were indistinct, but monitors said they heard no reference to injuries. Residents in the <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> area reached by telephone from <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> said they were not aware of violence. They said pilgrims prayed early today in preparation for the culmination of the pilgrimage. Others reached in <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION>, 25 miles away, also said they had heard no reports of violence. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which is boycotting this year's pilgrimage, charges that the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> royal family is not fit to supervise the holy shrines at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>. `` Hundreds of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Turk </LOCATION>, Afghan, Pakistani and American pilgrims demonstrated in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> today -LRB- Friday -RRB-, chanting slogans.. and carrying placards condemning the <PERSON> Al-Saud </PERSON> regime in their killing of over 400 pilgrims of the holy sanctuary last year in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said. It added: `` According to received reports, the Saudi regime's police ... subjected the demonstrators to severe control and surrounded them In some sections, they attacked the ranks of the marchers.'' Government-run Saudi radio quoted an unidentified official source as saying the report was `` made up'' and one of a series of `` lies and fabrications'' broadcast by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to create tension. The source was quoted as saying pilgrims in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> were undertaking their rites `` in calm and secure conditions.'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio and television also quoted an Iranian correspondent in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as reporting that hundreds of non-Saudi pilgrims demonstrated in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> on Friday. The report said the demonstrators chanted `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' `` Death to Zionism'' and `` Death to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' `` The <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> police, who had become scared, tried to surround the attendants,'' the correspondent was quoted as reporting. `` The rally then stopped moving, and while chanting the slogan ` unity,' the pilgrims asked all the Moslems to condemn the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The report made no mention of violence. Today, the ninth day of the month of Zhul-Hijja by Islamic calendar, is earmarked as `` Wukuf,'' or the day of standing, when pilgrims wake at dawn and travel six miles to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, where they remain praying, chanting and listening to sermons. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> said more than 1 million pilgrims from around the world gathered Friday in 111-degree temperatures for Sabbath prayers at the Grand Mosque in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, which houses Islam's holiest shrine. During last year's pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, 402 people were killed in riots. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> said the pilgrims, 275 of them Iranians, died in a stampede. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed Saudi police shot them. The Saudis accused the Iranians of defying a ban on protests. In April, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> broke off diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, accusing it of terrorism and subversion. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has been receiving the pilgrims and organizing the hajj, or pilgrimage, this year with extensive security measures to prevent a recurrence of violence. Saudi authorities earlier announced that the number of pilgrims would be restricted this year to one for every 1,000 residents of each Moslem country. The Iranians boycotted this year's pilgrimage when <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> sought to reduce the numbers of participants. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has charged that the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> royal family is not fit to supervise the holy shrines at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>.

 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> says he fears a wave of `` retribution'' against smokers, drunken drinkers and others whose actions are seen as a public health threat could spread to AIDS victims by the next decade, `` Such a response would be tragic, but not unexpected to the health profession,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said on Friday.

<HEAD>Church Leaders Bringing Gang Leaders Together For `Truce Summit'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Church leaders plan to hold a `` truce summit'' next week with gang members in hopes of stopping the bloody gang strife that claims about one life a day in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. Organizers say they hope this summer of drive-by killings, street-corner revenge shootings, and drug deals that explode into gunfire has persuaded gangs to gather on neutral ground to resolve their differences. `` We're going to see what's on the gangs' minds. We're going to try to stop the killings,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mims </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Faith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION>, said Friday. `` We're seeing members who are macho bad and looking at their graves. And they're ready,'' added <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Cater </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Antioch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, also in <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION>, one of the areas that is hardest-hit by gang violence. The summit meetings Tuesday through Thursday will include talks between representatives of factions of the Bloods and Crips gangs, the area's two biggest black gangs that police say have expanded their criminal activities throughout the West and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. A representative from the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> also will participate in the talks. The summit comes as highly publicized police sweeps and dragnets have failed to deter the drive-by shootings and other attacks that end in hundreds of killings each year. Gang membership has grown to 100,000 throughout <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, with youths enticed by a drug business that can net as much as $ 1,000 a day, authorities say. Gangs accounted for 387 killings last year, and 140 slayings the first half of this year, police said. Local leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> will try to convince gang members of the importance of keeping drugs off the streets. `` If we can attempt to stop drugs, kids wo n't have money,'' said <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimbrew </PERSON>, chairman of community affairs for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. `` Then they will have to seek job training or other employment.'' Security will be provided by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Kennth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s office. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff will send non-uniformed officials to speak with gang members. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Police Commander <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said he hoped the ministers could have a `` settling influence'' on gang members. The summit, including discussion sessions between gang members, follows six years of work by church leaders with gang members, who have pledged to work with the summit organizers, <PERSON> Mims </PERSON> said. `` They're going to have to realize that they're worth something, that they're not all bad, that somebody cares,'' <PERSON> Mims </PERSON> said. `` Then they got to realize that the killings must stop. I was a prison chaplain and I have n't seen anyone yet who wants to die. I've seen a lot people who feign or pretend. But nobody wants to die.''

<HEAD>Soviets Ready to Dismantle Radar Equipment, Not Entire Station,
Tass Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency corrected an earlier report to say that the Soviets are ready to dismantle equipment at a controversial radar station in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, not the entire station itself. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar station in south central <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that limits the missile defenses each superpower can build. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the buildings that now house the radar station must go because they could be used to hide materials after the radar itself is dismantled. But the latest <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> dispatch, transmitted Friday, spoke only of the dismantling of `` equipment.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar could be used to help direct the Soviet response to a nuclear missile attack. The Soviets say the radar is designed to track space objects and is not subject to the ABM treaty. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> told a government news briefing that the Soviets were ready to take action on the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> committed itself to observing the ABM Treaty for at least 10 years. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> originally quoted <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> as saying: `` If an understanding to abide by the ABM treaty, as signed in 1972, is reached, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be ready to dismantle the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar in a verifiable way that would leave no doubts on the part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' That sparked speculation at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> superpower arms talks that the Soviets had agreed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands. But Friday's dispatch from the Soviet news agency said that due to a translator's error, some of <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>'s words had been dropped, and that his statement should have said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was ready `` to dismantle the equipment of the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has begun his campaign for the White House with Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in a symbolic trip to his running mate's <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> home turf and a blast at <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying the Republicans `` would n't know a balanced budget if it hit them in the face.'' Traveling together in triumphant departure from their convention city of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the new Democratic ticket made a parting appeal to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s loyalists and then flew to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to tout their new <LOCATION> Boston-Austin </LOCATION> connection and declare their intention to sweep the state that is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s adopted home. `` The Republicans are all confused _ they do n't know what to make of this ticket,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator by his side. `` And they're worried, let me tell you, because they know we're not going to concede one single state of the 50 to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> this fall,'' he said The candidates left on their campaign stump with praise from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but the civil rights leader said his followers will be ready to turn up the `` street heat'' to make sure the nominees follow the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> agenda. `` You ask us trust you,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` All that we can ask of anyone is that they not betray that trust.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, praised <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' acceptance speech as `` very good'' but harped on the differences between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is far more liberal on most issues than his running mate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will be `` running against itself by the time we get through.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was scheduled to make campaign appearances today at a law enforcement convention in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> were traveling together in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> today, continuing their three-day, cross-country campaign kickoff swing with a rally in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> before flying to <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, for an appearance at the state fair Although <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> has but three electoral votes, they were journeying to the drought-stricken state in part to make clear their intention to challenge <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in all regions of the country, including the agricultural <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> as well as the electoral giants. The first stop out of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION> in the southern tip of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, not far from <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s hometown, Mission, and later to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, which both <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claim as homes. The Democrats spoke before about 1,000 people in sweltering heat on the airport tarmac in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, where many in the crowd sought shelter under umbrellas and some in the heavily Hispanic audience waved red and black flags of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmworkers </ORGANIZATION> union. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> called it fitting that the first stop was his home region, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> displayed his fluent Spanish to appeal to the crowd while reminding them that both he and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> have immigrant roots. `` And now we are the nominees _ the son of immigrants and the grandson of immigrants,'' he told them. `` That's <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, my friends.'' At a news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded to criticism from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his Republican opponent. `` If the vice president wants to spend all his time talking about labels, I guess he can do so. But we know who balances budgets and who does n't,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stood with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, their arms upraised at a rally surrounded by the city's skyscrapers and before a large crowd that numbered 3,000 or more. Hundreds more lined the street for a block as they left. `` I've brought a friend home from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, drawing cheers from his home-state crowd. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, appeared with them. Earlier in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had asked <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegates for support in a joint appearance where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had declared his support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and said he should be president. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also remarked that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s selection to the ticket `` means the Contras have lost a vote,'' and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was asked later whether that meant he had changed his position on aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` No, I have n't changed my position at all,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` There are those things where we're going to have some differences. I think that showed some of the qualities of this man, that he's quite willing to listen to different viewpoints.''

 Leaders of the Nicaraguan rebels, struggling to quell internal dissent, say they will seek a new round of peace talks with the leftist Sandinista government. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, one of the seven <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> directors, said Friday he is asking President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to arrange the talks. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> also said Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, a controversial hardliner who was elected to the rebel political leadership this week, will step down as military commander of the U.S.-backed rebel forces. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> told a news conference that <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> will be `` the military supervisor of our military forces, but without any command.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have said <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>'s election to the political directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance makes `` the possibility of negotiating peace even more remote.'' The Contras and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have been trying to negotiate an end to their seven-year war since March. The talks have been prompted in large part by the regional peace plan that won <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> last year's Nobel Peace Prize. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> is the chief Contra negotiator in the talks. The last round of talks ended in a stalemate on June 9, and no new talks have been scheduled. A temporary truce, however, is still in place after repeated extensions. The Sandinistas accused the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> of engineering <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>'s election to the political directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance They said his election removes the Contra leadership's `` civilian mask.'' <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, who publicly resisted peace talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, was a colonel in the National Guard of the rightist, pro-American Somoza dynasty that ruled <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for 42 years until the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> overthrew it in 1979. His background is a source of suspicion for some members of the resistance who fear the rebel movement is turning to the right. The controversy heated up after <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> was elected to the directorate Monday in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The seven commanders of the small Contra organization called the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which has a political base in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, resigned in protest. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> was the top military commander of the main, Honduras-based Contra force. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> publicly appealed to the seven Friday to withdraw their resignations. He said the new directorate `` will delegate areas of responsibility and, in this sense, Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> will step down next week from the general command of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said the leaders who resigned were frustrated that they were not getting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. He said the Costa Rican government would not allow delivery through <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. The Contra force led by <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> got <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid through <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said the Contras asked <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> two months ago for permission to deliver humanitarian aid through the Costa Rican <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, but have received no reply. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military aid to the Contras in February.

 Residents say they warned authorities for weeks about a crack in a concrete water tank that collapsed, releasing a 750,000-gallon wave that killed four people, injured 19 and destroyed nine homes. `` But as always they never listen,'' <PERSON> Perfecto </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> said Friday as he paused from digging through his house's rubble with a pickax The gray, rectangular tank was near the top of a steep hill overlooking a neighborhood of adobe, cinder-block and concrete houses. A 120-foot-long wall broke away from the tank without warning about 9:20 a.m. Friday. `` We heard a very loud sound, like an explosion,'' said <PERSON> Vicenta </PERSON> <PERSON> Saucedo </PERSON>, 33. She said she followed her daughters when they went out to see what had happened. `` I saw a torrent of water flowing past.'' Nine-year-old <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> was grinding corn near the bottom of the hill when he heard the noise and looked up. `` When I was running away, I saw a boy over there,'' he said in a shaking voice, pointing to a spot farther downhill. `` The water took him away.'' The water swept away people, walls, roofs, furniture and clothing. Survivors dug through the rubble Friday afternoon, searching for buried possessions in this border town near <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Some residents dried their salvaged clothes on parked cars. Others cleared spots in the dirt where they placed dishes, appliances, religious artifacts and other items. Three people died at the scene and a fourth died later in a hospital, Fire Chief <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. City engineer <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Soria </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Post </ORGANIZATION> that authorities were looking into the possibility that the 3-year-old tank's foundation was weakened by three weeks of unusually heavy rainfall. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, director of the city Water and <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said he inspected the tank after the collapse and could find no defects in materials, workmanship or design. The rectangular gray tank measured 120 feet by 60 feet and rose about 12 feet from the ground. Cracks started developing in the walls a few weeks ago, said <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, adding that he and other neighbors reported the problem to authorities. The tank was filled earlier this year, giving residents of two subdivisions running water for the first time. `` So we finally got water, but then we got too much _ and lost a life,'' <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>'s 17-year-old nephew, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Olvera </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, was killed. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 3, and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, 9, also were dead at the scene, the fire chief said. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said a man died Friday afternoon at a hospital, and that his identity was being withheld pending notification of relatives. One person was in critical condition at <ORGANIZATION> Juarez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a police spokeswoman said. Twelve others were hospitalized with minor injures and about six others were treated and released. <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallez </PERSON>, who lives near the accident site, said she also had seen cracks in the tank's walls. She said water started leaking from the structure's roof last week, prompting her to call authorities. She said she saw water trickling down the street from the tank's direction about 9:05 a.m. Friday `` Then, about 15 minutes later, I heard a sound like an explosion.'' The east wall appeared to have broken away cleanly from the rest of the tank. A 90-foot section of the wall was thrown 20 feet across a dirt road, where it came to rest leaning against a house, steel reinforcing bars sticking out of the broken concrete like a cat's whiskers. The rest of the 9-inch-thick wall was pushed to the side and blocked the road. The tank's other three walls and roof stayed intact. The tank was one of 23 serving the city, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. The water slammed into the homes before draining into a gully about 100 yards downhill from the tank. Mayor <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> promised that families made homeless would be guaranteed shelter, food and clothing. Water service was restored to the area Friday evening by re-connecting homes to a metal water tank.

 Heavy floods and one of the worst droughts in nearly 40 years combined to kill hundreds of people and wipe out thousands of acres of cropland this year, a government official said. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhenhuai </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said floods and torrential rain killed 544 people this year, and a drought scorching wide areas of central and southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> threatens to be one of the worst since the Communists came to power in 1949, the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said 27.9 million acres of farmland were affected by the drought, and 15.3 million acres had been flooded. The Civil Affairs Ministry this week said 65.8 million acres had been affected by drought and 24.7 million acres hit by flooding. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has about 296 million acres of arable land. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said 2.2 million people in the interior provinces of <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> are having difficulty getting water to drink. In coastal <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> province, 5 million people have been mobilized to expand canals and irrigation systems. `` It's bad that the drought is hitting the country's major grain producers at the key season for crop growing,'' he said. He said irrigation is difficult because many rivers and reservoirs are drying up. The Yellow River had hardly any flow over a 10-day period earlier this month and water in the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is down about 20 percent, he said. The drought has been accompanied by searing temperatures in the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> area, and the heat has caused nearly 500 reported heat-related deaths in major cities. Official reports said <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> is running out of chemicals needed to purify its water supply. In <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION>'s provincial capital of <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION>, one-third of the city's 3 million people are not assured of getting their daily minimum of 55 pounds of water. Floods mainly affected <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province and other areas of southeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> earlier this spring. But Typhoon <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> killed 20 in southern <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province last week, and the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that heavy rains have destroyed 14,000 homes near the northeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Qiqihar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said 10,600 more houses were destroyed in recent rainstorms in coastal <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> province. He said northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can expect more rain as the region's rainy season approaches, and people in the north who have just been relieved of drought are now preparing for floods

 A federal judge who threatened an attorney with jail over the use of `` Ms.'' and her maiden name is no stranger to such threats, say lawyers who practice in his courtroom. `` There is no more powerful man than an American judge sitting in his courtroom. He is a king,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunwasser </PERSON>, who once spent 48 hours in jail for missing a hearing before senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON>. `` I felt seriously threatened,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, who was surrounded by federal marshals when <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> objected to a petition he tried to file. `` It's also humiliating because it can affect the way jurors look at you and your case.'' <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> prompted feminists to demand his resignation and the local bar association to launch an investigation into courtroom sexism when he recently ordered attorney <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolvovitz </PERSON> to use her husband's last name and not use `` Ms.'' during a trial. Attorneys who have appeared before <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> said Friday his courtroom antics began years ago. <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON>, 73, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who took the bench in 1971, could not be reached for comment Friday. There were no answers at his office or home telephones. He consistently has refused to talk to reporters. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, now practicing law in <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> ordered him arrested and called him a liar in 1984 over a petition the judge claimed contained errors. `` I did n't lie, but if he has facts that say I did, someone else should'' have decided the issue, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said. `` He ca n't pitch and call balls and strikes at the same time.'' The judge later vacated his order. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Preiser </PERSON>, who now practices in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> called him a `` dumb Jew'' and threatened him with jail in 1985 when he asked the judge to reschedule a case around a Jewish holiday `` He said, ` It was the first time I had known you were Jewish, because I have never met a dumb Jew before,''' recalled <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahfood </PERSON>, <PERSON> Preiser </PERSON>'s co-counsel in the case. `` I was stunned and astounded,'' <PERSON> Preiser </PERSON> said. `` That courtroom was totally different from any other American courtroom I had been in before.'' <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> stepped down from the case after the two attorneys filed motions to the 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> for his disqualification. <PERSON> Mahfood </PERSON> said the judge was `` enraged'' over the motions to have him disqualified. `` He told us it was improper to investigate him and if we continued, we'd be put in jail,'' he said. In 1973, <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> dispatched marshals to a local court for <PERSON> Brunwasser </PERSON>, who was finishing a trial there. <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> had <PERSON> Brunwasser </PERSON> jailed for 48 hours for contempt for not attending a hearing scheduled at the same time. <PERSON> Brunwasser </PERSON> served the time, but the 3rd Circuit overruled <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> and cleared <PERSON> Brunwasser </PERSON> of contempt. `` He's got a Napoleonic complex,'' said <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>. `` He's very bright. He's very knowledgable in the law. But he's very domineering. He takes over your case and tries it for you.''

 In the words of Pee-wee Herman: `` Woooooooooooah.'' The man-child known for his silly knock-kneed walk, nasal high-pitched voice and childish taunts like `` I know you are but what am I?'' is talking these days about advertising and publicity campaigns, following his instincts and growing as a human being. Pee-wee's personality changed a bit after filming the upcoming movie `` Big Top Pee-wee,'' the sequel to the popular `` Pee-wee's Big Adventure,'' which cost $ 6 million to make and grossed $ 45 million `` I'm confident that this movie will do well, and probably will do better than the last one,'' Pee-wee said in a recent interview. `` I know it sounds smug to say that, but I've been involved in the advertising, promotion and publicity campaigns on this movie and I know that everything is being done to open successfully.'' `` Big Top Pee-wee'' was co-written and co-produced by Pee-wee's alter-ego, comedian <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reubens </PERSON>, 35, who created the Pee-wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> character in 1979 as part of a skit for an improvisational group in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> In `` Big Top Pee-wee,'' Pee-wee discovers lust, greed and ambition.

 A <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> diplomat asked <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to help secure the return of Soviet soldiers taken prisoner in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could help put an end to that country's decade-old civil war, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The official Soviet news agency reported Friday on the results of First Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the Iranian capital. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said `` much attention'' during <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>'s visit was paid to developments in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Soviet troops began withdrawing from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15. Soviet forces entered the country in December 1979 to help fight rebels opposed to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s Moscow-backed government. Many of those insurgents are Moslem fundamentalists supported by <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in their fight against the Marxist government that took power in April 1978 after a bloody coup. `` The Soviet side pointed out, in particular, that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> might make its contribution to the cause of normalizing the situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It was agreed that the sides would continue to discuss the issue constructively.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> gave no further details, but the Soviets presumably were eeking an end in Iranian aid to the Afghan insurgents. The Soviets repeatedly have accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of violating international agreements on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by not stopping arms and munitions shipments to the rebels through Pakistani territory. During his three-day visit to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, which ended Friday, <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> met with Iranian President <PERSON> Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, and he held `` businesslike talks'' with Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The Soviet side also expressed the hope that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would promote the return of Soviet servicemen, who are being kept by the Afghan armed opposition, to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The Iranian side promised to render assistance in this respect.'' The Soviets say 311 of their soldiers are missing in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and are presumed to be held by the rebels. In June, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> appealed to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as well as to the Afghan guerrillas, to help secure the return of the missing men. Previous Soviet diplomatic efforts on prisoners of war have focused on <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Last month in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> summoned the <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> ambassador to ask for his help in securing the prisoners' return. The Soviets have said they had more than 100,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> before the pullout began. Under terms of the U.N.-brokered agreement on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in April, half of the Soviet troops are supposed to be home by Aug. 15, and the remainder by Feb. 15.

<TEXT>
 About 2,500 followers gave evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> forgiveness, money and a standing ovation in his first crusade outside <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> since he was defrocked amid reports he hired a prostitute. `` I thank you for your kindness and your love,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said Friday night as he opened a three-day revival. `` I thank you for literally opposing every force of darkness and saying, ` We love you.''' The free meetings were not supported by the national or local Assemblies of God, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s former denomination. But many followers had already forgiven the <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> evangelist. `` I came out to support him. I feel as Christians we really need to stick together,'' said <PERSON> Glorisdine </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> schoolteacher who brought her two children. `` I'm pretty sure other ministers are sinning. They just have n't been found out yet.'' <PERSON> Jerri </PERSON> <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON>, 24, made her yearly trip from <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, with her husband and two children to see <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. `` I have forgiven him. When he got on TV and told the whole world to forgive him, I think they did,'' she said. In February, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> made a tearful televised confession that he had committed an unspecified sin against <PERSON> God </PERSON> and his family. The confession was followed by allegations he hired a prostitute to perform lewd acts while he watched. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON>, the self-admitted prostitute who contended <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> paid her to perform, lives in <LOCATION> Patoka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> captivated the crowd when he shook the Bible and highstepped across the stage in moves reminiscent of his cousin, rock singer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. `` I would love to be more calm were I talking about <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, but I'm talking about <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>,'' he said. He later directed followers who thought they had committed sins to the foot of the stage where he `` saved'' them. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, was among a handful of protesters outside Market Square Arena before the revival. Some carried signs reading `` Ban Christianity'' and `` Ban the Bible.'' `` He pays a prostitute, gets caught, gets thrown out of church and still wants to preach,'' <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> said. `` He calls himself a Christian. The man is a hypocrite.'' Inside, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> urged followers to contribute up to $ 100 in cash or checks, promising `` every dime and dollar'' would help save his ailing television show that appears on few stations nationwide. Each cancellation of his show makes him `` feel like my heart has been ripped out,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said. An extensive selection of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> albums, tapes, videocassettes and books was for sale during the crusade, and volunteers promoted 10 albums or five tapes for $ 20. `` People never tire of hearing the word -LRB- of God -RRB-,'' said a woman volunteer who declined to give her name. No estimate on the value of Friday's contributions and sales was available from crusade officials. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> returned to the pulpit May 22, but was defrocked by the Assemblies of God for refusing to abstain from preaching for a year while undergoing professional counseling. He said his multimillion-dollar global ministry could not survive such an absence. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, 52, said the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> crusade offered a fresh start. `` I've changed an awful lot,'' he said after a dress rehearsal. `` I'm more keenly aware of the hurt and pain of other people. I'm more aware of their weaknesses and despair.

 The south <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> kingdom of <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION> has banned visits by Fijians of Indian extraction, state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiji </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The radio station said the <ORGANIZATION> Tongan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ordered <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>'s national airline, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, other regional air carriers and shipping lines not to carry Fijian Indians to <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>. Radio <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>, which is about 500 miles west of <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, did not want to be flooded with Indians, especially businessmen. No Tongan government spokesman was immediately available for comment, but the ban was confirmed by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s general manager, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Drysdale </PERSON>. Pilots and cabin crew of the airline, many of whom are of Indian origin, have threatened to boycott Tongan flights in protest, Radio <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> said. Relations between ethnic Indians and ethnic Fijians in <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> have been tense since May 14, 1987, when Lt. Col. <PERSON> Sitiveni </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>, an ethnic Fijian, led a coup that ousted the Indian-dominated government of <PERSON> Timoci </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> said he mounted the coup to protect the political rights of ethnic Fijians, who are outnumbered by Indians in the 715,000 population. Many native Fijians resent the Indians because they control much of the local commerce. Four months later, <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> carried out a second coup against an interim government. <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> since has handed power to the nominally civilian government and appointed himself head of the army and home affairs minister in charge of internal security. Many Fijians of Indian extraction are seeking to leave the country.

 Federal investigators are looking into whether the crew of a DC-6 plane that ran out of gas and crashed in a drainage ditch took on less fuel than normal in order to carry more cargo from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Workers on Friday found the bodies of the plane's three crew members near <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meadow </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Lafourche </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> community about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Lafourche Parish Sheriff <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> identified the crash victims as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reti </PERSON>, the pilot; <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> LeFever </PERSON>, the co-pilot; and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hereros </PERSON>, the engineer.

<HEAD>Worshipers Report Messages from Virgin Mary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY E. LANE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of faithful from across <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have been flocking to a cavernous underground church each week to hear parishioners report what they claim are messages of peace and hope from the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. Crowds have grown from a handful of worshipers into hundreds, and are expected to swell to 20,000 for a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> feast day next month. The largest gathering so far was Monday night, when 800 attended a Mass and rosary service at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neumann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, parish officials said. The worshipers came to see three parishioners who knelt on the altar scribbling the `` messages'' in notebooks as the congregation recited the rosary, which is a series of prayers counted off on a string of beads, also called a rosary. After the prayers, the crowd fell silent as the first of the messengers read from his notebook. `` My dear little children, listen to me your mother, I want to help you,'' read <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Slate </PERSON>. `` I want you to be in heaven, where we can pray and serve our father for all eternity. Yes, my dear ones, you must have signs and you will have these signs ... but it will be up to you to believe.'' Messages from Slate, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officer, were followed by others from <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Constancio </PERSON>, a former hospital therapist, and <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, a housewife and mother. `` My children, do not be sad,'' read Mrs. <PERSON> Constancio </PERSON> softly, after first delivering the message in Spanish. `` Have joy in your hearts, have peace. Listen to the prayer that you ask for, the Lord will give it to you.'' Worshipers then crowded around the messengers, seeking blessings. The three laid their hands on those who said they were seeking help for physical or personal problems. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Golec </PERSON>, who journeyed to the service from <LOCATION> Midlothian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, in June, said his chronic knee problems disappeared after Mrs. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> relayed a message from <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> to him and the church pastor said a healing prayer for him. `` I believe this special healing was a sign to strengthen my faith,'' he said. Others attending the weekly Monday night rosaries have also claimed healings, or said they smelled roses or felt <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s presence. Monsignor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, pastor of the church built partially underground during 1972 to save on energy bills, said he and other parishioners began feeling <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s presence after a trip in January to <LOCATION> Medjugorje </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. They visited a spot where four visionaries have been reporting apparitions of the Virgin since 1981. `` This has been life-changing for me,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. `` It's much more life-giving than any of the -LRB- theological -RRB- stuff I've read.'' There have been skeptics, but <PERSON> James </PERSON> said it does n't bother him. `` I ca n't say somebody has to believe this,'' he said. <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> Bishop <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> is on vacation and has not commented publicly about the message reports. <PERSON> James </PERSON> said he has interpreted many of the messages as indicating that something miraculous will happen Aug. 15, the day Catholics celebrate the Assumption of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> into heaven. `` I think we're going to see some beautiful, beautiful thing _ experience her presence,'' said the 56-year-old priest. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, the parishioner in charge of planning for the Aug. 15 rosary, said the church is making plans with the city for crowd and traffic control for the event. Church officials said they are expecting 20,000 people based on the number of calls they have received. Although <PERSON> James </PERSON> said many people's lives have been touched by the reported messages and hundreds of people have discovered his church, he's worried that the messages may stop. `` You always have people jumping on the bandwagon,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. `` The question is who will be there in the heat of the day? Who's going to be praying when there are n't any messages?

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Ship Attack Was Really Palestinian-Israeli Clash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A newspaper reported today that an attack aboard a Greek cruise ship that left nine people dead actually was a clash between <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorists and the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret service. The <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> B.T. paper said an <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> terrorist squad and agents of <LOCATION> Mossad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s secret service, opened fire on each other on the liner City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> on July 11 after <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> stopped the terrorists from hijacking the ship. Israeli and Greek government officials had no immediate comment. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group on Thursday denied accusations it staged the attack. The paper quoted Danish intelligence officers and unidentified diplomatic sources as saying the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group started shooting after watching a television news report saying a car bomb detonated outside the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>. Greek police said the car bomb went off prematurely six hours before the ship was due to dock and killed two people in the car. B.T. said the terrorists planned to bring explosives from the car aboard the cruise ship when the vessel arrived in <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> with 471 passengers and that the explosives were to be used in a hijacking. Instead, the explosives were detonated by <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> to avert the hijacking, the newspaper said. It said two of those killed in the attack on the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> are believed to be <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> terrorists. Ninety-eight people were wounded in the attack. B.T. said <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> intelligence is working on the case because Libyan passport holder <PERSON> Hejab </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaballa </PERSON>, identified by the Greek government as the likely leader of the terrorist attack, arrived in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> on a flight from <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> June 1. <PERSON> Jaballa </PERSON> previously has been identified as involved in the assassination of an Egyptian newspaper editor, for which <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> claimed responsibility. <PERSON> Anastassios </PERSON> <PERSON> Sehiotis </PERSON>, Greek public order minister, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Jaballa </PERSON>'s real name is <PERSON> Khadar </PERSON> <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. On Thursday, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said it had nothing to do with the ship attack and that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> has been dead since 1985. It did not say where or how he died. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Sabry </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON>, has been blamed for many terrorist attacks, including those on the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> airports in December 1985 in which 22 people were killed and more than 80 wounded.

<TEXT>
 A self-described television addict will get a jury trial on charges that he chopped down a neighbor's 83-year-old oak tree to improve reception on his satellite dish <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 59, of <PERSON> Redding </PERSON>, pleaded innocent Friday to charges of second-degree criminal mischief and third-degree criminal trespass. His trial is scheduled for Aug. 10 in <ORGANIZATION> Danbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a construction worker, told police in June that he did n't know whose property the tree was on. After he cut down his neighbor's tree, he said, `` Now I can get the Disney Channel,'' police reported. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, the tree owner's lawyer, said he has asked <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to pay $ 37,000 in compensation to his client, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Marriner </PERSON>, 62, also of <PERSON> Redding </PERSON>, for the oak tree and a tulip tree police said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> cut down on <PERSON> Marriner </PERSON>'s property last year. <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> said $ 10,000 covers the cost of removing debris from the fallen oak and other trees damaged by it, and $ 9,000 is the estimated value of both trees. In addition, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> law says that in such cases tree owners are entitled to triple the value of the trees in compensation, <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> said. `` They are irreplaceable because of their age,'' <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> said. `` Both are ruined.'' <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> said he would give <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> one week to respond to his client's monetary request before filing a lawsuit to seek the money. Police said they warned <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> against trespassing after he cut down the tulip tree on <PERSON> Marriner </PERSON>'s property in May 1987. Asked for comment after his court appearance Friday, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, `` Forget it.'' His lawyer, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sienkiewicz </PERSON>, also refused to comment. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said after cutting down the oak tree in June that he and his wife are `` TV addicts.''

 A judge fined a flamboyant parachutist $ 200 for jumping off a 43-story skyscraper last fall, but suspended a 30-day jail sentence on condition that he make no more jumps this year. But <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Heid </PERSON>, 34, who defended himself, promised more jumps, saying if he `` did not go to jail in the next year, I would not be doing my job as a citizen.

It was all a part of a publicity stunt to sell his book. Two dozen of his skydiving buddies were waiting for him at a book-signing party. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> told jurors <PERSON> Heid </PERSON> thumbs his nose at the law, as shown in 1979 when he saluted Yosemite National Park rangers while leaping off the 2,200-foot <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitan </LOCATION>. `` I was very polite,'' <PERSON> Heid </PERSON> said. `` I told them, ` Have a nice day.'

<HEAD>Strike Reported Over In Armenia, Continuing In Nagorno-Karabakh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some factories in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> will work through the weekend to pay off debts caused by a general strike in a dispute over an Armenian enclave in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media said today. But public transport and enterprises in the disputed region, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, remain idled by a work stoppage, news reports said. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said the situation remains tense in the regional capital, <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, where residents have been on strike since May 23 to demand the annexation of the region by <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. On Monday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's top executive body, refused to alter the status of the district, which has a predominantly Armenian population but no common borders with the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The Presidium ordered officials to take steps to restore `` labor discipline'' and end the strikes in the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> dispute. But Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s report indicated little had changed in the small mountain region. `` The situation remains tense in the capital of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>,'' the radio said. `` Many enterprises are idle and public transport is at a standstill. However, farmers of the region have already harvested more than one-half of this year's bumper crop.'' Friday night's television news program `` Vremya'' showed deserted streets in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> and said only two buses were in service in the city. The republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> is mostly Moslem, while <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> is predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>. In February, 32 peole were killed in ethnic riots in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, 26 of them Armenians. Activists in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s capital, called a general strike on July 4 to increase pressure for the incorporation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> into their <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> republic. One <ORGANIZATION> Yerevan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official estimated that the work stoppage, which ended Monday, cost the republic $ 111 million in lost industrial production. `` As was reported in the <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> city party committee, it has been decided to work Saturday and Sunday to compensate for the debt that has formed,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda reported from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, Armenian activists called for a resumption of the general work stoppage to protest the Presidium's decision. Reports from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> residents and the state-run media indicated the latest strike call was largely ignored. A correspondent for Armenpress, the Armenian republic's official news agency, said only about 7 percent of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s industrial workers failed to show up at the job Friday. `` From the beginning of the work week, practically all enterprises are working, although in some places there have been occurrences of ` pro-strike' feelings,'' Pravda said.

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Workers in a building hit by a small plane say they tried to save a man screaming for help in the wreckage, but the aircraft exploded before they could reach him. All four people aboard died in the crash. `` The flames were shooting 10 to 15 feet into the air,'' B.G. <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, a machinist at the manufacturing plant, said Friday night. `` I ran back and alerted my co-workers by intercom.'' None of the 23 people in the <ORGANIZATION> Jepson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant were injured in the accident, which happened about 9:30 p.m. shortly after the single-engine Cherokee 180 took off from <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. A <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> pilot, who declined to give his name, said he watched the crash from the air. `` We were on our final approach when we saw a big fireball. I heard an airplane on the ground radio the tower and ask if they saw the crash,'' he said. The pilot said the plane appeared to stall during takeoff. Officials at the airport did not confirm the deaths, but a firefighter, who refused to identify himself, told the <ORGANIZATION> Greensboro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Record that everyone on the plane was killed. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said a team of investigators would be on the scene today. A flight plan for such an aircraft is not required and no plan was filed, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The plane had just fueled and reportedly was taking off for <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, when it crashed through the roof of the plant, a three-building complex that manufactures airplane seat covers, officials said. The workers inside the one-story building escaped safely, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON>, an employee of <PERSON> Jepson </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. `` The plane went through the roof into the sewing department,'' said <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON>, who saw the accident from a guard's post about 200 yards away. The fire at the plant was extinguished within 20 minutes, fire officials said. Five people were working inside the building the plane smashed into, said <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Jepson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burns </ORGANIZATION> employee. `` They all went out the back door,'' <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said. `` There's a fire wall between where they were working and where the plane went down at. Smoke drove them out the other door,'' he said. `` It sounded like a big boom. Me and a co-worker went out the back door. We did n't see anything at first,'' <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said. `` Everything looked normal. But when we went back in and came out the other door, we saw the flames shooting out of the roof.''

 A jury verdict awarding $ 700,000 in damages to a confidential source whose name was revealed by two newspapers could open the door to scores of similar lawsuits, a First Amendment expert says. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> were ordered Friday to pay $ 200,000 in actual damages and $ 250,000 each in punitive damages to <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> for a 1982 story that named him as the source of information about a political candidate's shoplifting conviction years earlier. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said reporters had promised him anonymity. The jury decided that a promise of confidentiality was an oral contract. `` It's very important to keep your word,'' a tearful <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said after the verdict. `` That's the hard currency of journalism. That's the hard currency of politics When that currency is devalued, we all suffer.'' The verdict distressed journalists, who have faced contempt charges and jail for not revealing sources, and now could face damages if they do. `` I believe this is absolutely unprecedented,'' said <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> attorney who has represented <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and other media organizations. `` If not reversed, this decision opens the door for an enormous range of real or imagined sources to claim that, in one way or another, they've been victimized by the press,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnegan </PERSON>, senior vice president-assistant publisher for the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, managing editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, said an appeal is likely of the <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury's 5-1 verdict. `` What we've been saying is disclosure of an 11th-hour dirty trick was at least as important as the 12-year-old shoplifting record which <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> was revealing,'' <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Finnegan </PERSON> said the punitive damages, associated with a finding of fraud and misrepresentation, `` ignores the fact that the editors involved handled the story honestly, fairly and accurately.'' `` In no way did we misrepresent. Nor were we guilty of fraud in our dealings with Mr. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Finnegan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pruitt </PERSON>, counsel for <ORGANIZATION> McClatchy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said the verdict was understandable because the judge did not instruct the jury on First Amendment issues. Making a reporter-source relationship a simple contract gives those who want to sue the press a new way to circumvent constitutional protections, <PERSON> Pruitt </PERSON> said. The suit centered on a decision by editors at both newspapers to overrule their reporters and use <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s name. At the time, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> was a spokesman for <PERSON> Wheelock </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, an Independent-Republican candidate for governor. Six days before the election, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> gave reporters documents showing that <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic-Farmer-Labor </ORGANIZATION> candidate for lieutenant governor, admitted shoplifting $ 6 in merchandise. The documents were given on condition <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s identity not be revealed. The day the stories appeared, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> was fired from his $ 35,000-a-year job as a public relations executive with an advertising agency, said his attorney, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothenberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> claimed he lost $ 725,000 in wages and pension. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> now has his own public relations firm and made $ 93,000 last year, according to testimony. In a related development, the Star Tribune began recalling all 640,000 copies of this weekend's Sunday Magazine after a person quoted by name in the magazine said she had been promised anonymity. Executive editor <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> that the <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> case `` figured in our thinking, but I'm not saying that's our only reason.'' He said publisher <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> made the decision after editors concluded they were n't sure whether a pledge of anonymity had been given by the free-lancer who wrote the article.

<HEAD>Assembly Passes Bills To Question Former President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The opposition-controlled <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> today passed bills aimed at forcing former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> and his family to testify before the assembly on corruption charges. The bills passed unanimously, with controversial provisions rewritten in a compromise between the governing and opposition parties. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> vetoed earlier opposition-sponsored bills and urged the assembly to revise provisions empowering it to summon witnesses with writs of arraignment issued by courts. Under the new bills, lawmakers can subpoena witnesses with non-binding writs of summons issued by the assembly. It was not immediately known if the writs would be effective in bringing <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> before the assembly. The opposition accuses <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government of trying to protect <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, but the government also is sensitive to public opinion The opposition controls 166 seats in the 299-member assembly but lacks the two-thirds majority required to override a presidential veto. Opposition lawmakers sought the bills to question the former president and his family, who have come under public criticism for alleged involvement in financial scandals. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-hwan </PERSON>, has been on trial on charges of embezzeling millions of dollars in funds while head of the semi-official Saemaul Undong development organization. The opposition also accuses the former president brutality in ordering the military to quell a 1980 uprising in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> in which about 200 people died. Despite continued government denials, dissidents charge <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his military followers with provoking armed clahes in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> as an excuse to seize power. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is one of former generals who helped <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> seize power in 1980. He has tried to distance himself from <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> by carrying out substantial reforms since the former president left office in February.

<HEAD>Opposition Challenges Government Over Official Secrets Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition lawmakers say Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s proposal to overhaul <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION>'s tight-lipped security law still will allow the government to keep too many secrets. Parliament has been debating the plan to reform the Official Secrets Act, which was hastily passed during a <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> spy scare in 1911. The act makes it a criminal offense for the government's 800,000 civil servants, diplomats and defense industry employees to reveal any official information _ no matter how trivial _ without authorization. <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattersley </PERSON> acknowledged that the Conservative government's proposal would loosen some restrictions. `` But in the areas where open, indeed honest, government is tested ... the same illiberal rules apply, some of them with greater forces and with few safeguards,'' he said during a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> debate Friday night. The government's revisions propose to decriminalize trivial leaks, give journalists more legal protection and confine secrecy mainly to defense, intelligence and foreign affairs. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, the Cabinet member responsible for law and order, said that except for two provisions in the revision `` every other move is in the direction of openness.'' `` No one can seriously weigh these two marginal additions against the immense reductions we propose in the scope of the present law and conclude that on balance we are extending the law,'' he said. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said one of the proposals that would toughen the law is the provision that would make intelligence agents automatically liable for criminal prosecution for any disclosure. The other provision would make all information on security, defense and international relations which the government provides in confidence to other countries an automatic official secret. <PERSON> Hattersley </PERSON> complained that the provision calling for automatic criminal prosecution of loose-lipped intelligence agents is unfair. He said `` ... when they disclose information, the rule is absolute, the criminal sanction is automatic _ no discretion there.''

 A 103-year-old man was stabbed to death and robbed of more than $ 1,000 he'd saved to pay for his burial expenses, a longtime friend said. `` Now we do n't have enough money to bury him,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clewis </PERSON>, 34, who found <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and said the old man had raised him as his son. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner ruled <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' death a homicide after he was found stabbed and bleeding Thursday in the ransacked living room of the apartment he'd lived in for 14 years. <PERSON> Ada </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clewis </PERSON>' mother, said she'd been <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' companion for more than 40 years. `` He walked crippled, but he was strong as an ox,'' Ms. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Daisy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, 98, said <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> moved slowly, carrying the memories of 103 years, which he often shared with her and other neighbors sitting on his porch. `` I would scold him a lot because he would n't do like I told him and take better care of himself,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. According to The Dallas Morning News, neighbors said <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> admitted an unknown woman to his apartment early Thursday evening.

 Representatives of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> were given checks totaling $ 5 million to be distributed to those who were exposed to the herbicide Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. On hand to accept the checks Friday were Australian General Consul <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurford </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> General Consul <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotton </PERSON>. The checks were made out to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> Agent Orange Trust and the Australian Vietnam War Veterans Trust and were part of a $ 240 million settlement of suits against the chemical's makers. According to figures contained in 1985 court papers, 48,400 troops from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and 3,842 troops from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> served with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The checks, $ 4.5 million for Australian veterans and $ 500,000 for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, were presented by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, who oversees the Agent Orange litigation. <PERSON> Hurford </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> on behalf of the <LOCATION> Australian </LOCATION> people `` that you have not forgotten the Australian veterans.'' Cotton also expressed his `` deepest appreciation'' and said that `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are happy to be together in peace.'' `` Please express to your veterans our appreciation for the help they gave us and our desire to help them as much as possible, our comrades in arms,'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said during the ceremony in his chambers. The class-action suit, which was filed in 1978, was settled in 1984 when the chemical companies agreed to pay $ 180 million. Interest gained during a lengthy appeal process upped the fund to $ 240 million. The companies sued were <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION>, Uniroyal, Hercules, T.H. Agriculture and Nutrition, <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. Agent Orange was sprayed over <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> during the 1960s by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, which hoped to deprive communist troops of crops and cover. The herbicide contains the highly toxic dioxin, and veterans contend that exposure to the defoliant causes cancer and other illnesses. Under a distribution plan, $ 170 million of the fund will be used for cash payments to American veterans, $ 52 million will finance social service projects to help <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and their families and $ 17 million will pay for attorneys' fees and administrative costs.

<TEXT>
 Ne Win, who wielded authoritarian power over <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> for 26 years, resigned today as chairman of the country's only political party and called for a referendum on ending one-party rule, sources said. Five other veteran leaders also offered their resignations, according to the sources, who attended a party conference where the announcement was made. The 78-year-old Ne Win cited poor health for his decision, they said. But the dramatic announcement came in wake of bloody student rioting, dawn-to-dusk curfews and a worsening economy. Speaking to an extraordinary session of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> said a referendum would be held before the end of September to decide whether the nation wanted a multi-party system or a continuation of single-party rule, the sources said. If the congress accepts Ne Win's resignation _ which it is almost certain to do _ party rules call for the election of a new chairman at the same congress. Ne Win resigned from the presidency in 1981 but retained the far more important party post. He was regarded as the most powerful figure in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. The resignation announcement was made available from people attending the congress, which was closed to foreign media and the public. Ne Win's speech was scheduled for public release later today. Ne Win, who came to power in 1962 military coup, has steered <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> along an isolationist road. His socialist economic policies have proved increasingly ineffective. Dissident viewpoints were quickly silenced. But since October, student-led demonstrations have three times rocked <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> cities, resulting in violent deaths, mass arrests and the closure of universities. Ne Win also asked the congress to approve the resignations of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yu </LOCATION>, the party vice chairman and president of the country; <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> secretary general and vice president; <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, party joint general secretary and secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON>, member of the party's central executive committee, deputy prime minister and defense minister; and <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tin </PERSON>, central executive committee member, deputy prime minister and finance minister. There was speculation that the five would retain their government positions, at least until the referendum is held. About 1,000 delegates are attending the three-day congress which opened earlier today at <LOCATION> Kyaikkasan </LOCATION> grounds. Authorities announced the congress on July 7, two weeks after thousands of students and other demonstrators battled riot police in the streets of the capital, leaving at least nine persons dead. Authorities have lifted a dusk-to-dawn curfew that was imposed on <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> following the rioting, but violence spread to the cities of <LOCATION> Prome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taunggyi </LOCATION> last week, with at least four people reported killed. Earlier this week the government radio disclosed that 41 people who were packed into police vans during rioting in March suffocated on their way to prison. Min <PERSON> Goung </PERSON> took responsibility for the tragedy, and resigned from his posts as home and religious affairs minister and in the 17-member party Central Executive Committee, the top policy-making body. Despite promises of economic liberalization last year, the government in October withdrew three currency notes from circulation and offered no compensation. This caused the first of the three major anti-government protests. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and knowledgeable Western observers said these outbursts, after years of passivity, reflected intense disillusionment with a government that has monopolized power for a quarter century while leading the resource-rich nation into economic ruin. In the past, Ne Win rooted out opponents and dealt harshly with the few occasions of open protest. Rarely seen in public, never interviewed by the press, <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> is said to be a superb and highly intelligent political in-fighter and strong nationalist. Regarded as potentially the richest nation in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> _ with a per capita income of less than $ 200 _ is among the world's 10 poorest countries. Once the world's largeset rice exporter and oil producer, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has suffered spot food shortages and has had to import petroleum products recently. Although the state officially controls much of the economy, most Burmese rely on black market goods smuggled in from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. Foreign analysts and many Burmese blame Ne Win's rigid, so-called `` Burmese Way to Socialism'' for these failures. The system is an amalgam of a centralized economy, one-party military-backed rule and Buddhism. Probably as a result of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s colonial past, <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> also sought to exclude foreign influence.

<HEAD>New Criminal Code Narrows Use of Death Penalty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An official revision of the Soviet criminal code greatly reduces the number of offenses punishable by death, making execution possible only in cases of premeditated murder, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The state-run radio said the proposed revision of the 28-year-old code also frequently replaces imprisonment with fines and other means of punishment. `` The new legislation will be more democratic and humane,'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting a Soviet professor, <PERSON> Ninel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuznetsova </PERSON>. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, a lawyer by training, has spearheaded the revision of the Soviet criminal code as part of his effort to rid his country's economy and society of a Stalinist legacy. The current code permits the execution of people convicted of treason, murder, flagrant corruption, war crimes and other offenses. Soviet media occasionally report on executions but have never indicated how frequently the death penalty is invoked. People sentenced to death in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are shot by a firing squad. Under the revision, `` the use of capital punishment will be curtailed,'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said in an international news broadcast. `` Death sentences will be issued to those who committed premeditated murder in aggravating circumstances.'' The Soviet radio also said that `` with a view to liberalizing legislation, it was decided to replace imprisonment, wherever possible, with other disciplinary measures and fines.'' Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said the draft of the revised criminal code will be completed soon, and that the result will be submitted for public discussion. It said there are also plans to widen the role of defense lawyers during pre-trial investigations and to increase the size of juries. The typical Soviet criminal trial is presided over by a judge and two `` people's assessors.'' Although equal in theory to the judge, the assessors commonly defer to his greater knowledge of jurisprudence. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, 57, named <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in 1985, is a 1955 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s law school, the nation's most prestigious.

 Hundreds of fighters were losing ground against the sweep of a nearly 20,000-acre wildfire in <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> wilderness as it edged its way to within a mile of Yellowstone National Park. But in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> firefighters made headway Friday against two fires that have cost more than $ 6 million and charred 12,500 acres in rugged mountains 150 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. And air and ground reinforcements were called in overnight as crews continued to fight a brush fire in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> that had nearly tripled in size Friday to 1,100 acres. The twin arson-suspected fires in <LOCATION> Calavaras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> have razed six homes, nine outbuildings, seven vehicles and a tractor since they began Tuesday. Firefighters had the fires 75 percent encircled by their control lines Friday night and expected full containment by Saturday evening, said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION>. But the more than 800 firefighters using almost 20 miles of hose near <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> were n't so fortunate as they tried to keep fire from crossing the forest's <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meadows </ORGANIZATION>, also known as Thoroughbred Meadows, into the park. Most growth in the lightning-caused Teton fire was attributed to `` spotting,'' when winds carry hot embers into areas separate from the main fire. Park officials have said they expect the fire to move into a remote backcountry section of the park within the next few days. Fire Information Officer <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said Friday, however, that the blaze was still more than 30 miles from any major park attractions, and <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> officials continued to stress they have not closed any facilities. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> fires had cost a total of nearly $ 6.4 million, including timber and property loss and fire suppression efforts. Some of the firefighters were sent home Friday, leaving about 2,800 to battle the blazes. The fires charred nearly 12,500 acres, leaving flames to gnaw mostly at uninhabited timber country in <LOCATION> Calaveras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, some 60 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, an out-of-control brush fire threatened homes Friday as hundreds of firefighters attempted to gain control of the blaze in steep terrain near <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The fire, spurred by hot temperatures and slight winds, had burned about 140 acres by Friday night, according to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> forestry department. There were no reports of structural damage and no evacuation was anticipated at the fire site, about 1 mile west of <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, a full fire team was called in to organize the battle on <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> land some five miles north of <LOCATION> Canon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Cooper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> dispatchers said late Friday. `` We will have ten 20-person hand crews'' on the firelines Saturday, supported by two slurry bombers, two helicopters and 11 truck pumpers, dispatchers said. The fire, dubbed the Dinosaur Fire because it is near fossil sites, was burning through an old logging area in steep terrain and mainly was consuming pinon, juniper and oak brush. A blaze broke out Friday afternoon on the <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> Indian Reservation northwest of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> and grew to about 1,500 acres within hours, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Curd </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> fire management officer in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. Several homes on the reservation and campers at nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> were evacuated, but there was no report of property loss in that fire. Curd said the fire jumped lines with ease because of shifting winds.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> visited three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships and met with top local defense officials during a two-day visit to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said today. The trip, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s first to the region as the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s top civilian official, was not announced in advance by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and was surrounded by special security precautions, including a bullet-proof car. Ball arrived in the gulf Friday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the visit had been planned for some time and was unrelated either to plans for reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the region or the investigation into the shooting down of an Iranian jetliner by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warship July 3. Meanwhile, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships weighed anchor and left <LOCATION> Manama </LOCATION>, bound for home after completing their three-month tours of duty in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>.

 Imprisoned black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> today accepted a government offer to visit with his wife and family. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> rejected a similar offer earlier this week to protest a government ban on celebrations of his birthday. <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, who flew to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> for the visit at <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, said the prison service had the best intentions in offering her husband a special meeting with nine of his relatives on his 70th birthday Monday. But she said the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader had decided to protest the government's ban on celebrations of his birthday and the detention of pro-Mandela activists by rejecting the privilege offered him. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has been imprisoned since 1962. During today's 80-minute visit, <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and his wife were joined by their daughter, two grandchildren and an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessman who represents the <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> family's interests. The attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, of High Point, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> agreed to grant power of attorney to him to protect the use of the <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> family name and its interests worldwide. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who announced a similar agreement with Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> earlier this week, said the agreement requires that he consult with <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> on all matters relating to the family. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the South African government as a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, which is the main guerrilla group fighting the white-led government. Before the family visit, <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amina </PERSON> <PERSON> Cachalia </PERSON>, activists who in the 1950s waged with him a campaign against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s policy of apartheid, which establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.

 The pickup truck driver indicted in a fiery bus crash that killed 27 people is relieved that the charges do not carry a possible death sentence, his lawyer said. `` He could n't sleep the night before wondering if he would live or be put to death,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>. `` He's had that answered.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 35, pleaded innocent on 27 murder counts and 58 other charges filed by a <LOCATION> Carroll </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury Friday. Prosecutors had said after the May 14 crash they would seek capital murder charges that could have led to a death penalty. But state Attorney General <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said, `` After investigating into the law and evidence, we concluded it would not be appropriate to make this a death-penalty case.'' <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> indicated authorities did not feel the crime was premeditated. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s bond was set at $ 270,000 cash. The non-murder counts include 44 counts of wanton endangerment, 13 counts of assault and one count of driving under the influence of alcohol. If <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> had been indicted and convicted of capital murder, he could have been sent to the electric chair. The lesser murder charge carries a possible prison sentence of 20 years to life. Referring to the lesser charge, <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said: `` This has taken a burden off him. The burden of what happened that night will never be off him.'' <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said if <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> were sentenced to life on one murder count, he would have to serve at least 12 years before being eligible for parole. Also Friday, the state medical examiner announced in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> that the 24 children and three adults killed in the crash died of smoke inhalation after the bus and the truck, which was going the wrong way, collided on Interstate 71 near <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>. The bus, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of God church, was returning from an outing to an amusement park in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The examiner, Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, said that alcohol was found in the bodies of four children, but he attributed this to a natural process and not drinking. `` I believe the alcohol showed up because of the post-mortem fermentation of blood sugar,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said, adding that the children probably had not drunk alcoholic beverages. The recommendation for capital murder had been made by <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who suffered a heart attack shortly after the accident, prompting the attorney general's office to take over the case <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON>, the case's chief prosecutor, said he met with more than 40 relatives of the victims Thursday night to explain the less serious charge. Asked if any of the families were disappointed with the decision, <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> said, `` I ca n't say that. We had a frank and candid discussion. If anyone was disappointed or disagreed, they did n't verbalize it to me.''

Police officials said 19 fishermen and crewmen were rescued from the boat, including a 38-year-old man who was hospitalized in serious condition, and that the remaining 29 people aboard the boat were missing. Previous police reports had said about 20 people were missing. There were no reports of injuries among the 75 men aboard the submarine or on the extent of damage to the vessel, <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self-Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Nineteen vessels and six helicopters from the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self-Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s navy, and the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s coast guard, were searching for the missing people, police said. The cause of the accident was under investigation. At the time of the collision, the submarine was cruising on the surface of the water on its way back to <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> after a training exercise, while the fishing boat was leaving <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the officials said. The submarine, built by <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, was commissioned in March 1984. It has two diesel engines and is equipped with six torpedo tubes. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials said the collision was the worst involving <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self-Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> vessels and civilian boats since World War II. It was the first collision in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> between a submarine and a Japanese civilian ship since 1981, when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear submarine hit a freighter, killing two people, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 A clash between villagers and police over a shrimp cultivation project resulted in the death of a policeman and a schoolteacher, police said Saturday. Police Friday fired into a crowd of more than 2,000 villagers who were trying to tear down a dam built to contain water for cultivating shrimp, police said. They said the schoolteacher was killed in the skirmish. About 50 people were injured and at least 20 were hospitalized, police said. The villagers, angered by the teacher's death, later beat to death a police officer, officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Residents of the village of <LOCATION> Dinna </LOCATION>, about 60 miles southwest of the capital of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, claimed the dam was flooding large areas of fertile land and destroying crops.

 A bomb exploded today about a mile from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, killing a man, his wife and their 7-year-old son and injuring an unknown number of others, <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police said. Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, on a pilgrimage for peace in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, denounced the bombing as an outrage. `` Here we are on a pilgrimage for peace,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> told reporters in Knock. `` How can we be anything but repelled?'' The blast, which occurred on the main road between <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, blew a Land Rover jeep off the road and left a crater in the pavement. Police said a number of people were injured, but they did not know how many. They said three people who were riding in two cars near the explosion were taken to a nearby hospital with minor injuries. There were no claims of responsibility for the bombing, which took place at about 10 a.m. close to a gas station near <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION>, 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, police said. They said they had not established the identities of the three dead. The British news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the family came from <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Down </LOCATION>, the site of the blast, and had flown in to <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> earlier that day from a vacation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` When I came out from getting petrol -LRB- gas -RRB-, I saw parts of bodies lying all over the road,'' said a witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` A Land Rover was blown into a field and two other cars were damaged.'' `` There was a thick column of smoke rising up into the air,'' <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> quoted another witness as saying. `` Helicopters were landing and taking off again and there was a fleet of ambulances being allowed through,'' another said. `` From what I could see there were a couple of cars lying in the crater.

 With <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s agreement this week to participate in a United Nations-sponsored cease-fire, and a South Africa-Angola agreement on crucial issues in their conflict, it seemed peace could become a reality for several long-troubled regions. Here is a summary of bloody conflicts with prospects for negotiated settlements:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IRAN-IRAQ</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 WAR STARTED: September 1980. WHY: Ancient enemies, the Persians of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and Arabs of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> went to war anew when minor border skirmishes were followed by a full-scale <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> invasion. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic fundamentalism clashed with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s modernizing socialism. TACTICS: Attacks on shipping, particularly oil tankers, in <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` War of the cities'' missile attacks on civilian populations. Widespread reports of use of chemical weapons by both sides. Casualties estimated at 1 million people killed or wounded. CURRENT STATUS: Fighting continues but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> last week agreed to accept a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution that could end the war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted the resolution last year. No agreement on format of talks.

<TEXT>
 A spate of mysterious fish attacks on bewildered swimmers at <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> may be the result of hungry, sex-starved catfish, a state biologist says. `` I think the fish might be a little cranky,'' state Fish and Game biologist <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Friday. `` The fish are spawning real late, and in the parts of the lake where the bites occurred, there is a noted absence of food fish. I think the fish are hungry and cranky because of the spawning.'' At least a half-dozen attacks on bathers have been reported recently. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> blamed catfish as the likely underwater terrorists after he cruised the lake on a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Whaler </LOCATION> outfitted with a large fish-shocker. He said parts of the lake, especially on the east side where fewer people go, are full of healthy fish. `` I do n't know why, but maybe it's the weather,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` We've had some real crazy weather this year.'' <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has been experiencing drought-like conditions and during the last week unusually high temperatures have been breaking records daily. After reports that the fish were really biting at <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> netted catfish, bass bluegill and suckers. He said he got 13 species, all of which normally are found in similar lakes. He said he found no people-eating monsters, as had been rumored locally. The catfish are found in shallow water, have a large mouth with curved teeth, and are known to be feisty when sexually aroused, hungry or hassled.

<TEXT>
 Democrats, who began their quadrennial convention with the threat of discord, headed home in dramatic unity to fight the fall battle for the White House. `` This has been a great convention and it sets the stage for a great Democratic win in November,'' the star attraction, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, told weary delegates gathered for one last party early Friday. His nomination was a given coming into <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, but the atmosphere in which he would accept it was uncertain. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s bus caravan rolled in Saturday with the runner-up in the primaries unsure whether he `` had a place at the table.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> arrived Sunday but refused to meet with the edgy <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> until he sat down with his trusted advisers to assess preliminary talks between the two camps. Republicans had a `` truth squad'' in town and took advantage of the apparent rift to boast of divided Democrats and a nominee-to-be powerless to control his convention. But a show of unity just hours before <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> gaveled the party's 40th convention to order on Monday night ended most talk of discord, although Republicans continued to assert <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was stealing the show. After a nearly three-hour meeting Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> declared their differences resolved, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promising <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a role in the fall campaign and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in turn promising his support. `` We did not come here for fireworks; we came here for noble works,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. With that, the convention opened _ to verbal fireworks, all aimed at the Republicans. Keynote speaker <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> pumped up the more than 4,000 delegates with fiery rhetoric that lampooned <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as his home state and portrayed the vice president as a do-nothing member of a disgraced administration. `` I want to announce to the nation that in a little more than 100 days the Reagan-Meese-Deaver-Nofziger-Poindexter-North-Weinberger-Watt-Gorsuch-Lavelle-Stockman-Haig-Bork-Noriega-George <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> era will be over,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> treasurer said to thunderous applause. The redeemed <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> made a prime-time appearance, too, adding his call for moral government to a convention with a deliberate Southern flavor. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had his night Tuesday, declaring himself qualified for the presidency and predicting he would occupy the White House in the future while urging his backers to support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the fall. In a show of respect, many <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates gave up their hall passes to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> alternates and supporters and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> placards were kept low while a sea of red proclaimed `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>!'' Despite that gesture, not all of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s backers got into the Omni convention hall. Thousands were kept out after <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s fire marshal decided too many people had already been let in, a problem that continued throughout the four-day gathering. Monday's detente had removed the potential for acrimony Wednesday, when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the party's blessing to take on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. All that was left was to crown the nominee, and after the rousing speeches of <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, there was some worry the star of the show might be upstaged. But actress cousin <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a supporting role once again, warmed the audience with an introduction of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the frugal family man, and when the standard-bearer entered the hall he was filled with emotion that carried over into the speech of his lifetime. His eyes welled and his voice cracked when he talked of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream of his late father _ a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> immigrant who arrived at <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> with $ 25 and rose to become a wealthy doctor. His smile was broad as he waved to his 84-year-old mother, herself an immigrant, and his wife and children gathered in a skybox above the made-for-TV rostrum at a made-for-TV convention. `` I'm a product of that dream,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said on his dream night. `` My friends, we're going to forge a new era of greatness for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke forcefully about his themes of jobs and day care and health care and competence, and sternly about his commitment to public service and his perceived lack of such in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. No stranger to television or teleprompters, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' delivery was as carefully choreographed as the swirling lights and patriotic music that had entertained the delegates before him. He ended with an Athenian pledge to strength, honesty and integrity, but not before allowing screaming delegates to interrupt repeatedly with a chant Democrats will surely take into the fall campaign: `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>? Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' _ a reference to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s professed ignorance of administration blunders. In the end, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was joined by his family, then <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and his family, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his family, the <ORGANIZATION> Carters </ORGANIZATION> and other contenders in what began as a crowded race for the nomination and ended with the crowning of the man who likens the race to a marathon. The confetti fell, the balloons followed and the Democrats went home happy.

 A man has been charged with murder three months after the decomposing head of a former boarder was found buried in his backyard. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> was named in a first-degree murder indictment issued Friday by a <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury. He is accused of murdering <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. Authorities said additional charges are pending against <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> in the death of a second man whose skull was found in <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s house <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>, 39, was arrested April 2 after a man wearing only a dog collar fled from <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s home, saying he had been held captive for four days and had been subjected to sexual abuse and torture. <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> was charged with seven counts of forcible sodomy, one of felonious restrain and one of assault in that case. He is being held on $ 750,000 bond each for the murder charge and the sexual torture charges. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>'s skull was found in a shallow grave the day after <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON> was arrested. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> apparently had rented a room for a time in <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s house, family members said. He would have been 21 in February. `` We had some forensic evidence, we had some medical evidence and a good deal of police testimony,'' <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Riederer </PERSON> said of what led to the grand jury indictment. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> died six weeks to six months before police found his skull, according to an anthropologist's findings filed in court. Analysis of <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>'s skull showed that the fifth vertebra, from just above the base of his neck, had been cut several times by a saw. The cuts were made `` while the deceased was still alive or shortly after death,'' according to court documents. Police seized two circular saws, a hacksaw, a miter saw, a disassembled jigsaw, 14 jigsaw blades, knives, scissors and clippers from <PERSON> Berdella </PERSON>'s house, according to search warrants. Charges in the death of another man, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON>, whose skull was found in <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s house, are pending, said <PERSON> Riederer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> was a 23-year-old <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> man. His skull was found in a bedroom closet in <LOCATION> Berdella </LOCATION>'s house. Police also found pieces of backbone and two envelopes of teeth in the closet.

 The weak dollar is not keeping hordes of Americans from traveling abroad this summer, but it has prompted many to seek cheaper destinations, travel consultants and tour operators report. Although some foreign countries are getting more American tourists than a year ago, overall foreign travel is running at about the same level as last summer, the travel professionals say. That was around 2.3 million Americans, up sharply from the 1.8 million in the summer of 1986, when the dollar's steep slide and terrorist incidents kept many at home. The dollar has continued its downward trend despite a rebound earlier this month. A dollar bought 131 Japanese yen on Friday, compared with 151 yen a year ago, while a British pound has risen to $ 1.74 from $ 1.61. `` The big factor obviously is the purchasing power of the American dollar,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cammisa </PERSON>, a travel industry consultant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` That's really the driving force.'' <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> still accounts for about half of all vacation travel overseas by Americans, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> remain the most popular destinations, with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> the leader by far. But the erosion of their buying power abroad has driven more Americans to countries like <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, where the dollar goes further, <PERSON> Cammisa </PERSON> and others say. Costs in those countries are lower and their currencies have not risen as sharply against the dollar as others have. `` It's the value of the dollar, and also the value of what the dollar buys,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerstetter </PERSON>, vice president of sales and marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Maupintour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, one of the country's largest tour operators. That principle is keeping tourists away from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kerstetter </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bookings to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are down more than 30 percent from last summer. `` People just ca n't afford to do it,'' he said. Even when Americans stick with their original countries, many of them are cutting back their spending or staying for shorter periods, experts say. `` They're buying down,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestage </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. For some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> travelers, that means staying in a moderately priced hotel, or even a bed-and-breakfast, instead of first-class accommodations, or cutting back or eliminating purchases of French perfume, British china and other goods. A typical seven-day European tour package, including airfare, hotels and some meals, costs around $ 1,350 per person this summer, up about $ 70 from last year. A room in a moderate European hotel runs about $ 150 a day, compared with $ 100 a year ago, while the average round-trip plane fare to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has jumped to about $ 800 from $ 600. Another feature this summer: More vacationers going abroad are using plane tickets obtained through frequent-flier programs. Some travel agents estimate that as many as 25 percent of their customers for foreign travel are cashing in frequent-flier awards. That could be artificially inflating overseas travel figures for this summer, since many of the `` frequent fliers'' might not have taken the trip without the free ticket. The dollar's slump, coupled with recent terrorist incidents overseas, led some potential travelers to delay booking overseas trips. The shooting down of an Iranian jetliner by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warship `` raised some concern,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON>, president of DMS Travel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The incident, which killed 290 people, initially sparked fears of a retaliatory attack by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, perhaps aimed at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial plane. <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> said his agency received many inquiries about airline security after the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> incident, but things have since returned to normal. Likewise, cruise ship operators say business is still steaming along despite a recent terrorist attack on a Greek liner. Travel to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, however, remains sharply below last year's levels because of continuing clashes between police and Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, travel professionals say Of course, there are some reasons for travel that defy currency rates and international terrorism. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Pandelaros </PERSON>, waiting in a long line on a hot street to get into the passport office at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Rockefeller Center, said he would go to see his relatives in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> `` even if it's a million -LRB- dollars -RRB- or it's nothing.''

 Police in the <LOCATION> Holy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> fired tear gas and shut down <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> shops today after protesters hurled rocks and bottles at them during a tense weekend of both Jewish and Moslem holidays. One Palestinian was hit in the head by a bottle, and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> was struck by a rock and taken to a hospital, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. Police said four Palestinians were arrested. In another development, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' closest aide sharply criticized <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> policymakers for refusing to talk to moderate Palestinian nationalists in the occupied territories. The aide, outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> director-general <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON>, singled out <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goren </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official in charge of the occupied territories, for conducting a `` too simplistic carrot-and-stick policy'' in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Hundreds of police reinforcements were deployed today in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to prevent disturbances as Jews and Moslems both prepared to mark holy days associated with the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, a site sacred to their faiths. In the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer saw police fire large quantities of tear gas to disperse protesters who threw rocks at them from the roofs of buildings in the city's Christian Quarter Hundreds of shoppers and tourists, some holding handkerchiefs to their noses, streamed out of the city's <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION> as the white tear gas floated over the streets. The trouble started after 60 mourners marched in a memorial procession for 15-year-old <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabadi </PERSON>, who was killed by Israeli troops Tuesday on the northern outskirts of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rabadi </PERSON>'s death caused several days of rioting throughout <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> annexed after capturing it from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in 1967. After the procession, police ordered the storekeepers to close their shops and fired tear gas to disperse the crowds. Merchants also accused police of overturning open air stalls lining the sidewalk near the <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>, where the ground was strewn with vegetables and boxes of goods. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> voiced concern Friday over resurgent violence in the occupied lands. Over the past week, nine Arabs have died, including the first Israeli Arab fatality since the Palestinian rebellion began Dec. 8. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 231 Arabs have been killed in the uprising. Four Israelis have also died. Israeli officials have said <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is becoming a center of the violence after months of relative calm in the city. Today's incident took place while the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was teeming with shoppers preparing for the four-day Moslem Eid al-Adha holiday, which starts Sunday. The holiday marks <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>'s sacrifice of his son <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> at the Temple Mount. At sundown today, Jews start observing the <PERSON> Tisha </PERSON> <PERSON> B'Av </PERSON> fast day, which marks the destruction of the Jewish Temple by the Romans 2,000 years ago.

 There were no riots, no wild costumes, no major protests, no great slogans or chants or buttons, no floor fights, no surprises and even no smoking. The four-day gathering, crammed into The Omni, was the first true made-for-television production from the Democrats, who have a long history of anything but bland and orderly affairs. There was plenty of emotion, once as <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stated his case for common ground and again as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the son of immigrants, accepted the presidential nomination. But this party was all business. Delegates were well-behaved inside and outside the hall. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> signs went down when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s went up. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> banners disappeared when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took the stage. Unity was the rule of the road. And everything was more or less on cue, from the delegates' shuttle buses to the tiny <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags passed out at the finale. You'd think they were Republicans or something. Sure, some in the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> delegation wore cheese heads and bounced an inflated cow up and down the rows. But even the tropical flowers decorating <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s state sign were plastic. `` I've been going to conventions since 1968. This is an amazing convention, and one of the big factors is that everything, everything is designed for television,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. On the sidewalks, buttons offered little more radical than a likeness of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with the red universal `` No'' sign. At the protest zone, porta-potties sometimes outnumbered the protesters. And even the signs were predictable. Unions were against <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. District of Columbians were for statehood. Iowans were for farmers. Georgians were for peaches. More radical sentiment can be found at high school basketball games. In fact everything in The Omni was so carefully set up for television, the building's regular lights were left off in favor of a specially constructed, low-hanging light system. Ca n't have that cavernous basketball arena look, you see. The salmon-colored paint decorating the podium appeared red on television. Workers never finished painting all of the podium, but the bare spots were out of camera sight. The spontaneous outburst for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' nomination was carefully orchestrated by a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producer. Even the chant, `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' had been rehearsed. When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> finally appeared before delegates some three days and five hours into the convention, he told them the presidential race `` is n't about ideology, it's about competence.'' He could have said the same about the convention itself. The Democrats wanted to show they could be organized, could look good, and could be `` presidential.'' By Thursday night, they seemed to genuinely like what they had done. There was a caucus or reception for everyone: women, Hispanics, blacks, state chairmen, gays, rurals, urbans, former cabinet members, former <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staffers. There was even an anti-convention convention down the street. There were some unusual twists to life in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last week. The party of the poor sold T-shirts for $ 15. A former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chef taught a cooking class on <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s orange flambe. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> was a reporter, <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON> -RRB- was a politico, and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> was a celebrity. Vendors tried to sell newspapers outside the convention complex, even though they were given away inside. The party of inclusion found itself locking out delegates and VIPs during the presidential roll call. It did n't really matter. The Democrats wanted an efficient show. <PERSON> Horrigan </PERSON>, whoever he is, was running for president. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was running with <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> _ on some buttons. The politics was all pretty predictable _ no brokered convention, no `` <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Scenerio </PERSON>.'' The Democrats were n't fazed. It was all according to plan. `` This is the best convention we've run in a long time,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told the delegates. Right on cue.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s highest-ranking admiral said the Latin American drug smuggling network has thousands of boats and planes and is so extensive it is impossible to shut off cocaine shipments arriving in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> said during a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that the only way to stop the drug flow is to cut off demand. Even if the entire resources of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and law enforcement could be thrown into the fight against drugs, it could not stop the flow, he said.

<TEXT>
 The Sandinista government has taken another step toward putting a label on its political ideology: socialist. But questions remain about the brand of socialism the Sandinistas have established. For one thing, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> maintains a mixed economy rather than a completely socialist one, with some market forces continuing to operate. The latest <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> statement on ideology came during a ceremony last week marking the ninth anniversary of the Sandinista revolution. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told the crowd that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had been a socialist state since 1979. Previously, government leaders described themselves simply as <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON>, who fought a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> intervention in the country in the late 1920s. `` <LOCATION> Sandinismo </LOCATION> is the Nicaraguan application of three great currents of universal thought: Marxism, Christianity and nationalism,'' <PERSON> Bayardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON>, one of the ruling party's hard-liners, once said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Barricada. Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> also have said that Marxism is one ingredient of the Sandinista philosopy. In his speech, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said socialism in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> means defense of workers, farmers and producers. He said it means a mixed economy, political pluralism and a non-aligned foreign policy. `` Our socialism is to protect all Nicaraguan producers that really have the desire to produce, to be efficient and share the riches with all,'' he said. `` This is all we ask and insist.'' Socialism, in its purest form, is public ownership of the means of production, with all members of the community sharing in what is produced. Aspects of socialist economics are present in many systems, ranging from those in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Such systems vary greatly, however, in the degree of social welfare they provide and the freedom of expression and political activity they permit. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> maintains the ability to control almost all facets of life, but keeps some trappings of an open society. The Sandinistas permit public political opposition, for instance, while maintaining control of the seven-party <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Eleven other parties exist, most of them small and ranging from the ultra-left to the right. The government points to the fractured opposition as proof of political pluralism. But the Sandinistas clearly define the limits on opposition activity. The government controls permits for marches, issues permits for buses or trucks to transport demonstrators, distributes paper for newspapers and bulletins, and licenses media. In the economy, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in June withdrew strict wage and price controls, saying a free-market system would encourage production. The government owns the banks, however, meaning it has control of credit, loans, distribution of scarce foreign exchange and regulation of all imports and exports. The Sandinistas recently nationalized the nation's largest and oldest private enterprise, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> sugar refinery. They said the measure was economic rather than political. The refinery's board of directors said the government did n't allow the owners to buy sufficent dollars needed to keep the company going Shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> came to power in a 1978-79 revolution, they confiscated land as part of their agrarian reform program to give plots to the peasants. According to government figures, 48 percent of the nation's land was owned by private individuals in 1978. By 1986, that figure had dropped to 29.2 percent. Some Sandinista leaders have looked to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as an example of socialism, but not necessarily as a model that should be immediately copied. The 30-year-old Cuban government tolerates no other political parties, no opposition media, no private enterprise and virtually no criticism. The Sandinistas, however, have copied <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION>, watchdog groups that monitor anti-government activity, almost to the letter. In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the organizations are called <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, unlike <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, has faced a civil war since 1981. Nor does <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> receive the heavy amounts of Soviet-bloc aid that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> enjoys. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is estimated to give <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> the equivalent of about $ 4 billion a year, while <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> receives about $ 500 million annually, not including military materiel. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, citing <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s links to the Soviet bloc, cut off economic aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1981 and imposed an economic boycott in 1985. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> frequently describes the Nicaraguan leaders as communists who threaten <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security. Local opponents of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> agree, saying that left unleashed <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would be a closed, Marxist-Leninist state.

 For all their imagery of Camelot revisited, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> ca n't rely entirely on the 1960 electoral playbook written by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. It is 28 years later _ years in which <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has lost a war and a few presidents, gone through a civil rights revolution, seen the emergence of a two-party South, and swung with the ideological pendulum. The <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that will decide whether to vote for Dukakis-Bentsen is far different from the one that narrowly chose Kennedy-Johnson, the earlier <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> combination. `` I do n't see that the analogy works, other than it's nice poetry,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> pollster and adviser to Democratic candidates. But they will be able to use some of the 1960 strategy that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> used in narrowly defeating <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. They've already begun. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was stunned that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> accepted the No. 2 post, since he had sought the presidential nomination himself. But in his book, `` The Making of the President, 1960,'' <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s selection sealed the plan they would pursue. `` The first of the Kennedy strategies had been a regional one, decided by the candidate alone, on the night of his nomination, by his choice of a vice president,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> wrote. `` He felt he had <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> locked up; that he must campaign personally for the big Northeastern industrial states; that <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> must be his Lord Constable for the Old South. These grand calculations worked.'' In many ways this year, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aim is the same. His selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was an attempt to reclaim <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with its 29 electoral votes. It also was an attempt to appeal to white swing voters in other Southern states, and to compel Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to invest time and money in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the South. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> as his running mate turned out to be one of the crucial differences of the election in 1960,'' recalled <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>, then a policy adviser to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, today a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney and author of the 1988 Democratic platform draft. `` <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> helped carry <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> ... He helped keep <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> said in an interview. `` A vice president is only a small reason, but it is an additional factor to cause people to vote, to return to their party.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, associate editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, recalled covering that 1960 race. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was facing hostility in the South and some other areas over his Catholic religion. The Thursday before the election, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in a futile attempt to hold a state so close to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He was spit upon by the crowd, <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> recalled. `` <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had gone in and really met that sort of thing in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' he said. The Kennedy campaign adopted an electoral strategy that focused on nine large states, <PERSON> White </PERSON> recounted. In 1960, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> together held 237 of the 269 electoral votes needed to win. `` It was in these big states that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> invested the greatest part of his time and personal effort, while <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> sought to spread himself over all 50 states of the Union,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> wrote. `` If those could be swept, and if another 60 or 70 electoral votes could be added by <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in the Old South, and if a few more solid <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> or Midwestern states could be counted in, then the election would be won handily,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> carried all but two of those nine: <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He swept <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the most heavily <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and his native region; much of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> including <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and some border states; and the small western states of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. His wins in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> were razor thin, and it's often noted that a shift of 4,500 votes in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and 28,000 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> would have reversed those states, and the election. But he won 23 states and 303 electoral votes, more than enough. If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> carried each of these same states this year, they would win, too _ but by a smaller electoral margin. Shifting populations have reduced the electoral votes of those states to 286. That leaves very little margin of error. Moreover, there are few safe Democratic states any more, and some of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> states may be out of reach to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. On the other hand, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is considered competitive in parts of the farm and industrial <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, and big states like <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he will mount a challenge, would make up for a lot of smaller states. The South has seen both the emergence of a strong <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that has dominated in presidential elections, and the emergence of a large black vote that is reliably Democratic. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> won black votes in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> _ indeed became champion to blacks when he intervened to help get <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> out of a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> prison two weeks before the election _ but black voter registration was low, a fraction of today's. There have been other changes too, like the switch to public financing of campaigns, that make a substantive comparison to 1960 impractical. But in the end, if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gets out of his <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> choice what <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> got out of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, it may be all that matters. `` If they win <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, they'll all be geniuses and probably win the election,'' said <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. `` If they lose <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, they probably lose the election.''

 Here are some facts and figures on <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE LAND _ <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> is about the size of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and shares frontiers with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. Resources include fertile soil, timber, oil and other minerals. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, with a population of 3.5 million, is the capital and largest city. <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, in the heart of the country, is the second-largest city and the center of traditional culture.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE PEOPLE _ Most of the 38 million people are Burmans. Important minorities include Chinese, Indians, Karens, Shans, Chins and Kachins. About 85 percent of the people practice Buddhism, with minorities adhering to Islam and Christianity.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE ECONOMY _ Per capita income is less than $ 200 a year, making <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> one of the world's poorest nations. It once was the world's leading rice exporter, but it experienced food shortages in 1987 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s debt has climbed to more than $ 3 billion. The black market _ fueled by smuggled goods from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ overshadows the official economy. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s economic failure is generally attributed to poor government management and a crippling war against several ethnic minorities seeking autonomy. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are major aid donors and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a modest assistance program, mainly in the anti-drug area.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 HISTORY _ <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s golden age was the 12th century, when its kings built the spectacular temples of Pagan. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ruled it from 1886 to 1948. After a post-independence experiment with democracy, a military coup in 1962 brought Gen. Ne Win to power. He imposed isolationism, military control and socialist economics. Ne Win held the presidency until 1981, when he resigned. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> seeks to maintain a strictly neutralist policy and keep out most foreign influences, including joint ventures with foreign companies. It has been nicknamed `` <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s hermit.'' Tourists are allowed to stay only one week.

<HEAD>Police Nab Two Alleged Pickpockets Using Mustard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two groups of pickpockets armed with mustard have been arrested at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where they had been preying on foreign tourists, a <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The arrests were made Friday night by an undercover team fighting a rash of incidents over the past six weeks involving mainly Japanese tourists, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. A technique becoming common among pickpockets is to discreetly squirt the intended victim with mustard or ketchup, then point it out and pretend to help him clean up. While the person is distracted, his pocket is picked or his bags stolen. The first group was arrested about 7:45 p.m. when undercover <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> police saw three men and a woman crowd a Japanese woman in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> said. The woman had just gotten off a plane from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and had her luggage with her. Two of the men engaged her in conversation while a third was feeling her luggage, according to the report filed by <ORGANIZATION> PA </ORGANIZATION> Detective <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodstein </PERSON>. Police moved in to arrest the four, all from <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, when the woman pickpocket took out a jar of mustard and opened it, <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> said. Five minutes later, police saw three men approach a man who had just disembarked from the same plane. `` One man squirted mustard on his sleeve, the second began wiping it off,'' <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> said. Police moved in as the third man went for the victim's bag. Thre three ran out of the terminal but their car was stopped as it was trying to leave the airport. The seven were all charged with jostling, a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail upon conviction, he said. The undercover operation at <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> will continue, <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Annual Moslem Pilgrimage Comes to Climax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of thousands of white-robed Moslems prayed, chanted and listened to sermons on Mount <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in 108-degree heat Saturday during the climax of the annual pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said there were protests in the holy city, but a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> official denied the report. For the second time since Wednesday, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said there were political demonstrations against the ruling Saudi family and against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Iranian government-run radio also claimed police `` attacked'' some demonstrators. Saudi authorities, however, said the pilgrimage, or hajj, proceeded in `` peace and security.'' The pilgrims on Saturday ascended to <LOCATION> Nimra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mosque </LOCATION> on Mount <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> after trekking from <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, nine miles away. Smiling men and women draped in their seamless white pieces of cloth brandished copies of the Koran, Moslems' holy book, during the ceremony inside the mosque. The ceremony was broadcast live on <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> television and via satellite. In their midst were Saudi security men, dressed in green fatigues and caps. Authorities said 20,000 of them guarded the pilgrimage. The pilgrimage season officially began July 15 with the sighting of the crescent moon, marking the start of the Moslem holy month of Eid al-Adha. The `` Wukuf,'' or standing at <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, represents the culmination of the annual hajj, which all of the world's 850 million Moslems are expected to make at least once if they can afford it. The culmination includes the stoning of the devil, in commemoration of the prophet <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>'s refusal to be tempted into disobeying <PERSON> God </PERSON>'s order that he sacrifice his son. On Sunday, after slaughtering sheep to represent the sacrifice of a sheep instead of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>'s son, the pilgrims begin a four-day feast. Prayer leader <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sheikh </PERSON> called upon Moslems to respect and maintain the sanctity of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>'s Grand Mosque as `` Allah has made it a place of refuge and security.'' Outside Nimra Mosque, waves of black and colored umbrellas shaded pilgrims from the sun as loudspeakers broadcast the ceremony. The temperature was about five degrees cooler than average for this time of year, but many cases of heat exhaustion and sunstroke were reported. On Friday, the pilgrims gathered for prayers at the Grand Mosque in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, which harbors the <LOCATION> Kaaba </LOCATION>, Islam's holiest shrine. It was after those prayers, according to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, that hundreds of pilgrims demonstrated in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> against the deaths last year of 402 people, mostly Iranian pilgrims, in the holy city. Saudi authorities said many of those killed last year were trampled in a stampede, and they denied Iranian claims that police opened fire on the march. Parts of the latest report by the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, were indistinct, but monitors said they heard no reference to injuries. `` Hundreds of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Turk </LOCATION>, Afghan, Pakistani and American pilgrims demonstrated in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> today -LRB- Friday -RRB-, chanting slogans.. and carrying placards condemning the <PERSON> Al-Saud </PERSON> regime in their killing of over 400 pilgrims of the holy sanctuary last year in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said. It added: `` According to received reports, the Saudi regime's police ... subjected the demonstrators to severe control and surrounded them In some sections they attacked the ranks of the marchers.'' Government-run Saudi radio quoted an unidentified official source as saying the report was `` made up'' and one of a series of `` lies and fabrications'' broadcast by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to create tension. Gen. <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sheikh </PERSON>, director general of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> security, said there were no incidents. Prince <PERSON> Majed </PERSON>, governor of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, issued a statement to the radio hailing the `` success'' of the hajj rituals. By Saudi count, there are 762,755 pilgrims from more than 130 Moslem nations who converged on the kingdom this year, joining an estimated half million from within <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. There were about 1,000 American pilgrims, according to estimates by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port city about 40 miles from <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. Non-Moslems are barred from <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Fall Season In Ruins; Networks' Loss May Be Cable's Gain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The three major TV networks are remaking old series in a scramble to fill the fall schedule as the five-month-old writers' strike threatens their already slipping share of the audience. Their competitors are n't ignoring the situation. `` We think there is going to be a gaping hole on the dial,'' said <PERSON> Seth </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for programming operations. `` We will pick up disenchanted viewers in droves.'' Said <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Networks </ORGANIZATION>: `` We're in good shape for the fall. We do very well when the networks are out of original programming.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to refilm 13 old episodes of `` Mission: Impossible'' in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> symbolizes the peculiar efforts by the three networks to plug holes left by the 9,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> strike. `` They're going to have a lot of trouble if they use Australian actors and have cars driving on the wrong side of the road,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodfield </PERSON>, one of the original `` Mission'' writers and producers. `` And it is n't going to be cheap. Those shows cost $ 500,000 to shoot in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> 20 years ago. To shoot them today in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is going to cost a whole lot more.'' The strike began March 7 over the issue of payments for reruns of one-hour domestic shows and a bigger share in the increased foreign market. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> admits privately that its fall schedule is a significant compromise from previous years. `` It's not the original programming we would have wanted,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> programming executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity. `` But something has got ta be put on the air.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is not alone in making improbable programming decisions in the wake of the walkout that has left TV actors with time to do other things, like <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosley </PERSON>'s return to the stage and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON>'s revival of his nightclub act. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has plans to bring back, with a new cast, `` The Hardy Boys,'' a detective show that lasted less than three seasons after it debuted on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 11 years ago. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, which finished third in the ratings last season for the first time, will bring back `` Candid Camera,'' which has n't been on network television in 20 years. The program was so unpopular in the syndication market that it was recently withdrawn from sale. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> also will broadcast at least one news special from TV personality <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, and the network may convert the cartoon `` Fat Albert'' into a live-action prime time series. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> also is fortunate to have television rights to the Summer Olympics and the World Series. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, frequently at odds with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, is encouraging the news division to produce a variety of specials. `` The executive producers have been asked internally to come up with some ideas and float concepts,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The strike hits the networks at a time when their share of the TV audience has slipped to its lowest level ever. Fewer than 60 percent of viewers now tune in the networks when watching television, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> have devised fall promotion campaigns to lure unhappy network followers They both have sizeable movie libraries and their original programming is produced so far in advance that their schedules do not suffer immediately from the strike. Movie theaters and video stores also expect to benefit from the strike. Especially embarrassing for the networks, they will be unable to mount much of a public relations blitz at the annual summer convention of television critics, starting this week in Universal City. `` They're going to have to use some smoke and mirrors to get through the first three months of the television season,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, TV critic for the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Some advertisers believe the networks may be forced to provide free advertising time, called `` make goods'' in the industry, when replacement programs fail to produce guaranteed audiences. `` I think there will be a lot of make goods'' this fall, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostyra </PERSON>, executive vice president and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> director of media services at <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` But I do n't think of it in disaster terms.'' In its forecast for the fall, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> advertising agency <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> has predicted that only three of the networks' 21 new shows _ <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Empty Nest'' and `` Dear John'' _ will be hits. `` I think, obviously, it's going to be a disruptive season,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Igiel </PERSON>, senior vice president and director of programming at the advertising agency N.W. <PERSON> Ayer </PERSON>. `` In some cases, these replacement shows may not work.''

 Writer-producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisele </PERSON> says the only blessing of the 20-week scriptwriters strike has been the opportunity to get acquainted with his infant daughter. `` It's been a wonderful time for bonding with <PERSON> Marissa </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Eisele </PERSON> said Friday. `` She was born March 26, nearly three weeks after the strike began.'' But for <PERSON> Eisele </PERSON>, a writer and co-producer of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` The Equalizer,'' it's also been a time for frugal living and a return to earlier pastimes of writing poetry and plays. `` I'm coping financially because I was raised in a sort of austere middle class existence,'' he said. `` I've always been frugal with my money. I've never lived beyond my means. I knew when I got into this industry in 1980 that it had a history of long strikes, so I saved my money and bought a house I could afford. `` I can pay the mortgage. I can hold out for a long time. But I have writer friends who are not so lucky. I'm going to look at a friend's sideboard that he's selling to pay the rent,'' he said. As a `` hyphenate,'' the industry term for a person who performs several jobs, in his case writing and producing, <PERSON> Eisele </PERSON>'s salary was `` in the neighborhood'' of $ 200,000 to $ 400,000 a year. The average writer who does not have a regular job and depends on free-lance sales makes considerably less and the median income of working members of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> is $ 43,000 a year. At any given time, only about half of the guild's 9,000 members are employed. The strike began March 7 over the issue of payments for reruns of one-hour domestic television shows and a bigger share in the increased foreign market. `` We are very well paid, but we also create the product,'' he said. `` We are first among equals. Without our vision no one else can go to work. I think because we do create the work we should be compensated with residuals.'' `` The Equalizer,'' which has completed its third year on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, is now a viable show for syndication. `` If a show is syndicated, then every episode I've written will bring in a certain amount of residuals over the years,'' he said. `` It becomes an annuity for a writer.'' `` They want rollbacks in some areas but they are n't flexible in the area of foreign residuals,'' <PERSON> Eisele </PERSON> said. `` The foreign market is growing. There's going to be an explosion in the foreign market for television.'' <PERSON> Eisele </PERSON> was playwright-in-residence at the American Conservatory Theatre in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in 1975-76. His first film work was a low-budget movie called `` Breach of Contract,'' which starred <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyote </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>. In 1985 his friends <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> asked him to write a script for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>.'' His script, called `` Ordinary Hero,'' won the Humanitas Award for 60-minute drama. He wrote the first show for the 1986-87 season for `` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>.'' He was story editor of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Crime Story'' before going to `` The Equalizer'' this past season as co-producer. During the strike he has written a script for <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` American Playhouse'' called `` Last Light,'' the story of the relationship between a condemned man and a prison guard. Public television is not affected by the strike. He also is outlining a new play and has brought out some of his poetry, to give it a polish and send it off to various journals. `` I'm getting by because I've always had an old working boy's outlook,'' he said `` I've never tried to impress people with my wealth, not that I have any. I do n't take to the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> glitz.''

<TEXT>
 Democrats, who began their quadrennial convention with the threat of discord, headed home in dramatic unity to fight the fall battle for the White House. `` This has been a great convention and it sets the stage for a great Democratic win in November,'' the star attraction, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, told weary delegates gathered for one last party early Friday. His nomination and that of the man he picked as his running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, were guaranteed coming into <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, but the atmosphere in which the ticket would be formed was uncertain. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s bus caravan rolled in Saturday with the runner-up in the primaries unsure whether he `` had a place at the table.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> arrived Sunday but refused to meet with the edgy <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> until he sat down with his trusted advisers to assess preliminary talks between the two camps. Republicans had a `` truth squad'' in town and took advantage of the apparent rift to boast of divided Democrats and a nominee-to-be powerless to control his convention. But a show of unity just hours before <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> gaveled the party's 40th convention to order on Monday night ended most talk of discord, although Republicans continued to assert <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was stealing the show. After a nearly three-hour meeting Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> declared their differences resolved, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promising <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a role in the fall campaign and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in turn promising his support. `` We did not come here for fireworks; we came here for noble works,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. With that, the convention opened _ to verbal fireworks, all aimed at the Republicans. Keynote speaker <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> pumped up the more than 4,000 delegates with fiery rhetoric that lampooned <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as his home state and portrayed the vice president as a do-nothing member of a disgraced administration. `` I want to announce to the nation that in a little more than 100 days the Reagan-Meese-Deaver-Nofziger-Poindexter-North-Weinberger-Watt-Gorsuch-Lavelle-Stockman-Haig-Bork-Noriega-George <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> era will be over,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> treasurer said to thunderous applause. The redeemed <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> made a prime-time appearance, too, adding his call for moral government to a convention with a deliberate Southern flavor. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had his night Tuesday, declaring himself qualified for the presidency and predicting he would occupy the White House in the future while urging his backers to support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the fall. In a show of respect, many <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates gave up their hall passes to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> alternates and supporters and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> placards were kept low while a sea of red proclaimed `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>!'' Despite that gesture, not all of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s backers got into the Omni convention hall. Thousands were kept out after <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s fire marshal decided too many people had already been let in, a problem that continued throughout the four-day gathering. Monday's detente had removed the potential for acrimony Wednesday, when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the party's blessing to take on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. All that was left was to crown the nominee, and after the rousing speeches of <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, there was some worry the star of the show might be upstaged. But actress cousin <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a supporting role once again, warmed the audience with an introduction of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the frugal family man, and when the standard-bearer entered the hall he was filled with emotion that carried over into the speech of his lifetime. His eyes welled and his voice cracked when he talked of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream of his late father _ a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> immigrant who arrived at <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> with $ 25 and rose to become a wealthy doctor. His smile was broad as he waved to his 84-year-old mother, herself an immigrant, and his wife and children gathered in a skybox above the made-for-TV rostrum at a made-for-TV convention. `` I'm a product of that dream,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said on his dream night. `` My friends, we're going to forge a new era of greatness for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke forcefully about his themes of jobs and day care and health care and competence, and sternly about his commitment to public service and his perceived lack of such in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. No stranger to television or teleprompters, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' delivery was as carefully choreographed as the swirling lights and patriotic music that had entertained the delegates before him. He ended with an Athenian pledge to strength, honesty and integrity, but not before allowing screaming delegates to interrupt repeatedly with a chant Democrats will surely take into the fall campaign: `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>? Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' _ a reference to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s professed ignorance of administration blunders. In the end, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was joined by his family, then <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and his family, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his family, the <ORGANIZATION> Carters </ORGANIZATION> and other contenders in what began as a crowded race for the nomination and ended with the crowning of the man who likens the race to a marathon. The confetti fell, the balloons followed and the Democrats went home happy.

 Two decades ago, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> worked with his hands in his tool-and-die shop in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, not far from Yankee Stadium. He had two employees; he eked out a living. That was long ago, before the dollar signs multiplied and then multiplied again, before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called him a hero of the 1980s, before his <ORGANIZATION> Welbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> became <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. Now <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>'s waiting for a jury to begin deliberations on charges that he and five co-defendants, including Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, turned the company into a racketeering enterprise that dispensed millions in bribes to secure government contracts. `` It took me 20 years to build this company and you intellectuals robbed my company from me,'' <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> said in federal court. <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>, 58, is an illiterate who by dint of know-how and enthusiasm turned <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> into a success story. `` My reading ability will go as far as a comic book is concerned. Do n't ask me to read the Times,'' he said. <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>'s parents were natives of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and he was born in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. He dropped out of high school and joined the military. Once out, he tried to start a business but it failed, as did his next two businesses. But by all accounts he is very good with his hands, a mechanical genius. And in 1970 he hooked up with <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON>, a mechanical engineer. Together, they built <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. With <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> as chairman and chief executive officer the company expanded, obtaining <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracts set aside for minority-owned companies on a no-bid basis. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> hired welfare recipients, drug addicts, gang members. Soviet emigres, Cambodian boat people, Indians, blacks and Hispanics all were represented among the employees, and financial analysts joked that the company had to hire translators and hold its meetings at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> fired the company with his can-do spirit. He spoke to each new employee to infuse them with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s up-by-your-bootstraps philosophy When layoffs struck, he delivered groceries to the workers. An employee with a sick parent in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> would receive time off and a ticket home. After <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> during the 1980 campaign and promised to do more to revitalize the area, <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> heard the call. He attended about a dozen meetings of Hispanic business leaders in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and met with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at a session devoted to finding ways to help poor neighborhoods. The contracts rolled in. Eventually, the company employed 1,500 people and did $ 100 million in business annually. <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> lived in the exclusive <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION>. `` The president has pride in this firm,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, when he announced that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> had won a $ 24.2 million <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pontoon contract in April 1984. `` It has a heart. It has a soul.'' A month before, at a Republican dinner in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> saluted <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> as `` a hero for the'80s.'' And the next year, an agency of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> named him minority entrepreneur of the year. Then it all came apart. He was ousted as chairman and chief executive director in February 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> eventually closed shop and sought protection under bankruptcy statutes. <PERSON> Neuberger </PERSON> pleaded guilty to bribery conspiracy and larceny. Like three other <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials who also pleaded guilty, he testified against <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>, accusing him of participating in a multimillion-dollar slush fund that siphoned off money from the company. The prosecution says <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, 70, a 10-term congressman, extorted nearly $ 4 million in <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> stock in exchange for helping the company. The defense maintains the stock was given to <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s law firm to settle unpaid legal fees owed by <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> argued that the company gave its stock to powerful figures like <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> in gratitude for their help _ not as a quid pro quo for contracts. <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> said that if there were any illegal activities, he was kept in the dark by other executives, shielded by his own ignorance. `` My writing ability is nil. For 20 years, you could look at my company's records, you will not find one letter or any documentation or anything in my handwriting,'' he said. Bookkeeping was left to the bookkeeper, he said. When prosecutors asserted that he knowingly broke the law, his answers were emphatic and to the point: `` No ways, no how.''

<TEXT>
 Just before <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stepped onto the convention podium for the most important moment of his political life, longtime friend <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> gave him two words of final advice: `` Go slowly.'' He meant it. Despite a highly successful political career and three terms as governor, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> carried to the stage at the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention a reputation for stepping on good lines and doing better at reducing political emotions than inspiring them. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> wanted his friend to avoid what he saw as a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rhetorical pitfall of hurrying his speech, of talking so fast the words carried no punch. His friend listened. `` He did it,'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said, still beaming with the enthusiasm of the convention's final night as he headed out of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and into the new Democratic campaign. `` He paced himself.'' In so doing, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> answered the doubters who questioned his ability to move an audience and to reveal enough soul to lead a political cause. While the display of soaring rhetoric and moving delivery may prove short-lived, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> achieved it on the night he most needed it _ claiming the Democratic presidential nomination. Indeed, at his first campaign stop the next day in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seemed to revert to his sometimes bland and wooden delivery. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides believe that in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last week they achieved all they could have: a united convention, a supportive <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and a moving prime-time television hour in which the candidate revealed himself to the nation. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, the senior adviser and campaign chairman who has been <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' friend since their days at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said the candidate seemed a little surprised by the emotion evoked in the convention hall and by his own success. `` He said, ` I walked out there ... and it exploded.' `` You know, how many people get nominated for the presidency? I do n't think he quite knew what to expect,'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said. In fact, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speech was a departure in style from the moment he stepped into view. He walked slowly from side to side on the stage, accepting the cheers by slowing raising one arm and then the other. That modest wave was more expressive than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been all week. `` He threw his hands up _ you know <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does n't usually do that,'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said. `` When he did that, the whole place exploded.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used many of the lines he has used since the campaign began in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, referring to his immigrant parents and invoking the imagery of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s election nearly three decades ago. But with the aid of speechwriters <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, he dressed up those references in newer phrasing and, in delivering them, seemed to connect with his audience in a way that communicated more emotion than before. `` Most of it was <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' language ... with better cadence, better rhythm,'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said. His closing remarks _ a reference to keynoter <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' granddaughter, to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s five children and to his own expected grandchild _ were penned in by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself after Tuesday night's speech by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>. A day later, he traveled to the convention hall and spent three and a half hours checking out the podium and rehearsing before a TelePrompTer in a private room that was a replica of the stage. He stayed, practicing, for two hours more than he had scheduled. When his speech was over Thursday night, aides and observers pronounced it as good as he had ever been. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had an explanation for his adviser <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>. `` He said the crowd does it to you once in a while,'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said. `` He was sort of choked.''

 A moderate earthquake shook southwestern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> on Saturday, but there were no reports of injuries or damage. The <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said the temblor occurred at 12:20 p.m. and measured 4.4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. It was centered 112 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> in the Kalamata region. `` We felt the quake, but nobody panicked,'' said a police officer by telephone in <LOCATION> Kalamata </LOCATION>. `` We're used to earth tremors now.'' An earthquake measuring 6.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale hit Kalamata in September 1986, leaving 20 dead and several thousand homeless. Many residents of the picturesque coastal town are still living in prefabricated homes. The police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were no reports of injuries or damage in Kalamata or the surrounding villages. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today decried the `` midnight in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' rhetoric of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> speakers, saying the country is in far better shape than Democrats would have people believe. `` Our liberal opposition seems to think so much is bad in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. To hear them talk, you would n't think that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is in the longest peacetime -LRB- economic -RRB- expansion in history,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. In his weekly radio address, delivered from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s mountaintop ranch near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, the president took note of the just-concluded Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, saying Americans should have been `` shaking your head'' at some of the statements. It was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first public comment on the convention. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> seized the latest consumer price report as evidence of `` good news from a Republican administration.'' Showing frustration with statements Democrats made at their convention, he told reporters the administration has given the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people the longest peacetime business recovery on record. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> disputed Democratic assertions that the administration for nearly eight years has worked principally to enrich those who were already well off when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came into office in 1981. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who watched <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> deliver his speech Thursday night accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, said today that `` growth and opportunity have been born again in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` Listening to the rhetoric, you would never have guessed that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economy is the strongest in decades,'' the president said. He did not mention <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> other any other Democrat by name. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been following the events in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> from his ranch, where he has been vacationing for the past week. In his radio address a week ago, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> predicted that his economic policies would come in for heavy criticism at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> gathering and told his listeners the country is better off economically than when he became president. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> cited the June Consumer Price Index as proof of a stable economy. The report said inflation rose at a moderate annual rate of 4.2 percent last month, and that for the first six months of this year the pace was 4.4 percent, the same as in 1987. `` The data continued to show no significant acceleration of inflation from the 4 percent range that has prevailed in recent years,'' he said, `` more good news from a Republican administration that's given you 68 straight months of economic recovery.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, a farming area, suggested the administration needed to do more to tell its side of the economic story, saying officials should `` quit hiding our bushel here.'' Asked if that meant he had adopted a strategy of using White House news briefings to take on the Democrats, the spokesman replied, `` No, although you've never seen me bashful to talk about the glories of our economic recovery, have you?'' Meanwhile, the White House announced that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had started the process of bringing trade sanctions against <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> announced that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had invoked provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 to punish <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for allegedly refusing to provide adequate patent protection to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pharmaceutical and chemical products. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will bring sanctions against $ 200 million worth of Brazilian imports, and there were indications these punitive measures would come in the form of tariffs rather than embargoes. The administration said it remained to be decided which Brazilian products would be affected. `` Adequate patent protection is the cornerstone of a healthy pharmaceutical industry,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a statement. `` By denying this basic commercial right, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> permits unauthorized copying of pharmaceutical products and processes that were invented by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms. This not only deprives American companies of sales, it discourages investment in the research and development of new drugs.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, has maintained that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s policy on patents has cost the industry up to $ 150 billion in losses since 1979. An administration official, declining to be named publicly, said it was likely the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> would settle on a damage figure of roughly $ 36 million a year since 1979, before public hearings aimed at determining which Brazilian products would be included in the trade sanctions.

 A nurse who says she suffered excruciating pain and emotional distress after a doctor yanked her ponytail has been awarded $ 65,000 in an out-of-court settlement. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovel </PERSON> said she was sitting at the nurse's station in <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Sept. 25, 1984, making notes in a patient's chart, when someone pulled hard on her ponytail and said, `` Hey, babe, what's going on? `` My head jerked back so hard that the chair came up resting on the back two wheels,'' she said. `` The pain was excruciating.''

 Democrats think they can lure more votes this year out of the Cuban-American Republican stronghold, as some <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Cubans try to increase their conservative ethnic group's involvement in a national Hispanic coalition `` We see the Cuban community as an area of opportunity,' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, a Mexican-American who has been an aide to <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Gainesville </LOCATION>, and was spokesman here for the National Hispanic Caucus. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> said efforts to increase Hispanics' political clout by having Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans and other Latins working together foundered with election of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980. But the group held daily, well-attended meetings last week during the Democratic National Convention, <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> said. Coral Gables banker <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauredo </PERSON>, a Cuban-American who was a <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration aide, was selected as a co-chairman of the group. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON>, the 34-year-old Cuban-born attorney who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Cubans traditionally have n't been active in national Hispanic groups Their immigration story is different than those of the Puerto Ricans and Mexicans. The Cubans fled a homeland, where they had a comfortable standard of living, because of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover and have made anti-Communist stands a major part of their politics. <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> noted that in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>, 97,000 Cubans are registered as Republicans, compared to 23,000 Democrats. He said the figures do n't include second-generation Cuban-Americans who were born in this country, and the younger Cubans are more likely to join the Democrats and identify with other Hispanic groups. `` It's been frustrating, but it's getting better,'' <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said. He said Cubans have seen that despite tough rhetoric, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> policies were n't particularly strong. <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said he would emphasize that the Democrats are closer to the Cubans' true best interests. `` Every time that something good happened to us _ the doors were opened, the air bridge from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, the social programs that helped us _ the Democrats were in office,'' <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> remains a priority, but there are other issues that bind us together,'' <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> added. He said the Cubans, with their strong anti-Communist interests, can still fit into the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> just as do Jews with their strong stands on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and blacks with their anti-South <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> interest. `` I think other Hispanic groups should defer to us on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. I see no contradiction with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> condemning <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> within the framework of human rights, just as it condemns <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said. Campaign planners in the state for Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> say they wo n't concede the Cuban vote to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and probably will have <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> campaign among them. Both nominees speak Spanish. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s popularity with Hispanics in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and his conservative stands might play well with Cubans. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said he received 25 present to 35 percent of the Cuban vote in his 1986 election, after 1984 presidential nominee <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> got about 5 percent `` I think there is the legitimate basis for a transition. I do n't think it's going to happen overnight,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a Southern co-chairman for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign and former <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said there's little chance <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will pick up <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> votes. Republicans will be emphasizing his liberal positions and opposition to aiding Nicaraguan Contra rebels. `` Our Cubans are going to be wholeheartedly for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Girl Who Met Pope, Then Became Addict And Hooker, Returns To
Writing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In 1984, at age 13, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lau </PERSON> was one of 12 winners in an essay contest who got to meet Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. At 16, she had become a runaway supporting herself and her drug habit with prostitution. `` I told myself this was n't prostitution, it's just give and take,'' <PERSON> Lau </PERSON> said. `` It was there, and I had about 25 cents in my pocket, and I had an amazing capacity at first to just block it out.'' Then she realized that her writing was taking a back seat to drugs. `` That totally destroyed me,'' said <PERSON> Lau </PERSON>. After an unsuccessful suicide attempt, she wound up in a hospital a year ago. She decided to stop doing drugs and resume writing. Now, at 17, she has a <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> grant for $ 13,000 -LRB- more than $ 10,700 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- for her writing and a contract with a <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> publisher for her first book, to be called `` Small Lives: The Diary of a Street Kid.'' She also has more dubious signs of success _ legal problems and lawyer's fees, over which she has little control because she is now a ward of the state. She left home because of friction with her parents, possibly the reason social caseworkers decided not to return her to her parents. And since she was a juvenile not with her family, Canadian law required that she be made a ward of the state. She said officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> have told her they are not sure she can handle the grant, which comes out to about $ 1,100 -LRB- more than $ 900 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- a month. She is negotiating with public trustee <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsey </PERSON> and the ministry superintendent over how her grant should be paid. `` It's hard enough being a writer and not getting a paycheck every two weeks, and the rewards are few and far between,'' <PERSON> Lau </PERSON> said after she learned of the award last week. `` Then when you get rewarded, they take it away from you. `` I felt like I was more of a human out there -LRB- on the street -RRB- than I am now. At least I had some control.'' `` I'm supposed to be jumping up and down, but I feel like every time I do something that everybody should be happy about they have an anxiety attack,'' she said. `` They're afraid I'm going to take the money and blow it, which is n't even feasible.'' `` If I went out and got a job that paid $ 1,100 a month, they would n't come after me and say, ` You're making too much money,' so how is this different? Is n't this work?'' she said. `` We want to make sure the monies are used for the purposes intended by the grant,'' <PERSON> Rumsey </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We would be responsible in looking after the funds as trustees.'' <PERSON> Lau </PERSON> also receives $ 480 a month in social assistance. She pays $ 300 for rent and uses the rest for writing expenses. `` When I get my check I buy my supplies first _ paper, ribbons, stamps. I'm constantly submitting my short stories and poems to magazines, and I'm not going to give that up, but it's amazing how much it costs,'' <PERSON> Lau </PERSON> said. Her first encounter with the problems of being a ward of the state came when the public trustee hired lawyer <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> to review her contract with literary agent <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukowski </PERSON>, her book contract with <ORGANIZATION> Collins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> and her manuscript for any potential libel. <PERSON> McColl </PERSON>'s $ 175-an-hour fee is to be paid from <PERSON> Lau </PERSON>'s advance on royalties from <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, although the size of the advance was not known. <PERSON> Bukowski </PERSON> said the lawyer is unnecessary because the publisher has its own lawyers to check the manuscript, butMcColl said he redrafted the agent's contract, approved the publisher's contract. `` We have a responsibility to protect the child,'' <PERSON> Rumsey </PERSON> said. `` The publisher may well have counsel, but that does n't necessarily mean the best advice is going to go to the infant.''

<TEXT>
 Hungarian leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, eager to strengthen ties to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as part of an ambitious reform program, comes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week on the first visit by a Hungarian of his rank since the country came under <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> rule 40 years ago. Since becoming premier in June 1987, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has moved decisively to pursue economic and political openings to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where the image of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for years had been largely shaped by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s smashing of an anti-Moscow uprising in 1956. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s 11-day, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit, which began last week and took him to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, has its high point Wednesday when has a luncheon with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during a White House visit. He also will meet with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, congressional leaders and Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who became <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary last May in addition to premier, is the first <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leader to make an official visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since 1978 when President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> received Romanian leader <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceaucescu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, 57, is from the same generation as <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and, like the Soviet leader, he has called for a new era of openness and economic restructuring. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, insisting on anonymity, said that <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> will be encouraged during his talks here to continue his announced policy of seeking increased trade with and investment from Western countries. To improve efficiency, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has been pushing market-oriented approaches but this and other measures have increased unemployment levels in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Another problem area for <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s $ 11 billion foreign debt. Among economic goals approved by the party since <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>' accession are more foreign investment, fewer restrictions on the ownership of foreign capital, an expansion of private initiatives, and a greater voice for consumers In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> last Wednesday, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> witnessed the signing of a $ 115 million joint venture between a Hungarian entity and <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an Illinois-based glass manufacturer. `` We have seen science and technology tear down borders between countries and even continents ... and those who come to recognize this will be in an advantageous position,'' said <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> also met with officials of <ORGANIZATION> MacDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to discuss a larger presence in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for the fast food giant. The firm already has a thriving operation in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has been courting West European leaders as well. He was received warmly on visits to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and three weeks ago, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> became the first communist country to reach an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. The accord will gradually allow expanded Hungarian exports to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by removing present tariffs and quotas between now and 1995. Still, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is intent on maintaining its traditional role as a member of the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. More than three decades after the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, an estimated 65,000 Soviet troops are deployed there. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials recently received indications that the Soviets were planning to withdraw these forces but thus far there has been no announcement.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address given from his ranch near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>: My fellow Americans, this week there was a certain meeting in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and maybe like me, you just could n't help hearing a few things about it and shaking your head. Some people just do n't seem to learn. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want to hear straight talk about where our leaders plan to take the country, not personal attacks. For all our history, we Americans have debated our differences vigorously. But like two of the earliest political adversaries in our history _ <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> _ while we've always fought hard for our differing opinions, we've honored each other for taking part in the democratic process. This week's convention speakers seemed to forget this American tradition. But beyond that, there was something amazing about what we heard. Our liberal opposition seems to think so much is bad in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. To hear them talk, you would never have guessed that we're in the longest peacetime economic expansion on record, that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has created over 17 million jobs in the last five years, or that a greater proportion of Americans in the work force has jobs today than ever before in our history. You would never have guessed that after dropping by three percent when their party was last in the White House, the real income of the typical American family has grown by more than 10 percent since the current expansion began. You would never have guessed that our cuts in tax rates and recent tax reform have done exactly what we said they would do _ Americans with the most income pay more of our total income taxes than before. Many Americans at the bottom of the scale no longer pay any income tax at all, and growth and opportunity have been born again in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Most of all, you would never have guessed how much our expansion has meant to all Americans. For example, one respected economic writer noted that for black Americans, the year 1982 to 1986 represented, in his words, `` on every front, jobs, income, even household wealth, the best five years in black history.'' No, listening to the rhetoric, you'd never have guessed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economy is the strongest in decades. To them, it's midnight in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> It's the same sad song they sang four years ago. They say they want to turn <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> around. When their party left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> eight years ago, inflation was at one of the highest levels in American history. Now, it's under control. Do they want to turn that around? When they left office, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s industrial productivity was stalled, our competitiveness was slipping, and technological research, the key to our industrial future, appeared to be on hold. Today, manufacturing productivity is rising strongly _ some rate us as the most competitive nation for manufacturing costs in the industrial world, and we're again the world's leader in developing new technology. Do they want to turn that around? And when their party turned over the keys to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was going forward with the biggest arms build-up in history. We were cutting back, and the Soviets had invaded <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Today, we have the first treaty in world history to eliminate an entire class of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet nuclear missiles. The Soviets have pulled troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and American-Soviet relations are better than they've been for a good, long while. Do they want to turn that around too? They said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can do better. With that, I wholeheartedly agree. But the people also know that the last time our opponents were in charge, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> did a heck of a lot worse. What do your opponents really want to do? Well again and again, we've heard from the press that our opposition just wo n't say. We've heard that they do n't want to level with the country because when they've done that in the past, the country has n't liked what it's heard. So this year, they've learned one lesson _ they're covering their tracks. You'll never hear that `` L'' word _ liberal _ from them. They've put on political trenchcoats and dark glasses and slipped their platform into a plain brown wrapper But while they're saying that government needs to do more of this or more of that, will they also pledge not to raise taxes? While they're talking about reducing the danger of nuclear weapons, will they also pledge to go forward full speed with our <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, the one practical way of reducing the threat of those weapons once and for all? And while they're talking about the war on drugs, will they also support the death penalty for drug kingpins? The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people expect straight talk about real issues. That's what they deserve and that's what they ought to get. Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

<HEAD>Honeymoon is Over, But Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Still
Optimistic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, the nearly bald regulator of the nation's savings institutions, is known as an optimist by the comb he still carries. A year ago, Wall pushed hard for and was appointed to the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a job only a cockeyed optimist would want at a time of unprecedented industry losses and mounting S & amp; L failures. To prove his credentials, he had only to pull out his pocket comb and make a rueful reference to the few, wispy strands of hair on the top of his head. Despite a year filled with criticism and difficulties, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said in a recent interview, `` We have n't had any surprises'' and, asked about his comb, he said smiling, `` I still have it.'' The 48-year-old former Republican staff director of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> enjoyed something of a honeymoon after he took office last July, replacing <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, an aloof administrator disliked by his staff, the industry and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A big part of <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s problem was outside his control. His agency was out of money and could n't do much to stop the savings industry from sliding into a morass. Wall came in with a number of pluses: a squeaky clean image, a reputation for candor and enthusiasm and, most importantly, money to work with. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last August provided for a $ 10.8 billion, industry-financed infusion over three years into the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which guarantees deposits up to $ 100,000 in 3,100 institutions. Now, the honeymoon is drawing to a close and there is no shortage of critics. But even the critics acknowledge the bank board's Herculean task. Insolvent institutions account for more than 10 percent of the industry and losses in 1988 are expected to top the $ 7.6 billion, post-Depression record of last year. `` I think he has the toughest job in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and everything has to be seen in that context,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemel </PERSON>, a former bank board, economist now an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> put Wall through a grueling session when he revealed he had more than doubled his estimate of the cost of closing or merging insolvent S & amp; Ls in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the state where the industry is sickest. In May, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> was being criticized for being too optimistic by insisting it was too soon to tell if his agency needed more money, while private analysts were calling for a taxpayer bailout. Democrats were suggesting there were political motivations for pushing debate over the problem into the next administration. Wall's refiguring less than two months later boosted the pricetag for cleaning up the entire industry nationwide from $ 22.7 billion to $ 30.9 billion, more in line with the $ 26 billion to $ 36 billion estimate of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and within range of the $ 40 billion to $ 75 billion estimated by private analysts. But he was still criticized for the change. `` Now you see it, now you do n't,'' complained a frustrated Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Wall, in the interview, said the new estimate was based on new information, adding, `` We're trying to present a realistic view of the problem. We're trying to keep everyone's fever in proper perspective.'' Despite the higher projected pricetag, Wall is still saying the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> could have enough money to handle the problem. But to do that, he has had to offend another important constituency _ executives of the industry he regulates. Savings institutions were already disturbed by <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s support of legislation extending by one year the moratorium preventing them from converting from <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> membership to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The healthier <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> insures deposits in commercial banks, charging member institutions less than half of the assessment charged by <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. Industry executives objected when they found out Wall intended to cover the cost of his his newly increased estimate of costs by extending the special assessment thrift institutions are paying to recapitalize <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> to 1998. Originally, it was scheduled to be phased out by 1991. B.R. <PERSON> Beeksma </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> InterWest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said the extension would be misguided. `` What's necessary for this industry to survive in the long run is the ability to attract new capital. ... Recently, the entire profits of our business have been made available to solve the problems of <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. Yet we simply have to have profits because we ca n't attract capital unless we have them,'' he said. Wall has also been criticized for moving too slowly in closing or finding buyers for insolvent institutions in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which alone accounted for $ 3.5 billion of the industry's $ 3.8 billion loss in the first three months of this year. `` It's just taking too long to get the deals done,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, consultant. `` And by being so slow, they are reducing the number of people who are even willing to look at a deal.'' `` We're critical of ourselves in that regard,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said, but he pointed to three large transactions in the state in May and June and promised the pace would pick up. Since money began flowing into <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> coffers in October, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said his agency has closed, merged or otherwise resolved the problems of 65 S & amp; Ls. And, conservatively, he said the board would resolve the cases of another 100 institutions by the end of this year, about one third of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls considered insolvent under regulatory rules. `` If you had asked me about three months ago, I would have said we're getting a lot of great promises, but not much action,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Butera </PERSON>, chief lobbyist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group. `` But in the last three months, he has really come through.''

<HEAD>Leader Resigns After 26 Years; Announces Referendum On One-Party
Rule</HEAD>

 Ne Win, who was blamed for leading <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> into isolation and economic ruin during 26 years of authoritarian rule, quit Saturday as chairman of the nation's only political party and announced a referendum on one-party rule. Speaking to a special session of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the 77-year-old leader cited bloody anti-government rioting in March and June as a main reason for his resignation. Five veteran party leaders, including the nation's president and vice president _ less important positions than the party chairmanship _ also resigned. `` Since I am indirectly responsible for the March and June affairs and because of my adanced age, I am resigning from both party chairmanship and also as a member,'' Ne Win told 1,000 delegates in remarks broadcast on state radio and television. `` Bloodshed in March and June showed the lack of trust and confidence in the government,'' Ne Win said. `` To find out whether the majority or the minority are behind -LRB- the demonstrators -RRB-, a referendum must be held so the people can choose between the existing one-party system or a multi-party system.'' He said the referendum would be held no later than the end of September, until which the current government would continue its functions. If a multi-party system is chosen, Ne Win said, general elections must be held. Even if voters chose to retain a one-party state, there should be `` necessary modifications,'' he said. `` Whatever the results of the referendum, and whatever the new government, I will completely retire from politics,'' Ne Win said. The party congress was expected to choose a new chairman Monday. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kha </PERSON>, prime minister since 1977, was seen as a likely candidate. Since coming to power in a 1962 military coup, Ne Win led <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> into isolation from the world community. The nation's economy deteriorated, and political and personal freedoms were curtailed. Student-led demonstrations have rocked <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> cities thre times since last October, resulting in deaths, mass arrests and the closure of universities. Ne Win resigned from the presidency in 1981 but retained the far more important party post. He was the most powerful figure in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Authorities announced the convening of the three-day party congress on July 7, two weeks after thousands of students and other demonstrators battled riot police in the streets of the capital, leaving at least nine people dead. A daytime curfew imposed on <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> following the rioting was lifted, but violence spread to the cities of <LOCATION> Prome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taunggyi </LOCATION> last week and at least four people were reported killed. State radio disclosed last week that 41 people who were packed into police vans during rioting in March suffocated on their way to prison. Despite promises of economic liberalization, the government in October withdrew three currency notes from circulation and offered no compensation, triggering the first of the three major anti-government protests. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and other Western observers said the outbursts after years of passivity reflected intense disillusionment with the government. Regarded as potentially the richest nation in resources in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has a per capita income of less than $ 200 and ranks among the world's 10 poorest countries. Once the world's largest rice exporter and an oil producer, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has suffered food shortages and has had to import petroleum products. Although the state officially controls much of the economy, most Burmese rely on black market goods smuggled in from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. Most foreign analysts and many Burmese blame Ne Win's rigid, so-called `` Burmese Way to Socialism'' for these failures. The `` Way'' is an amalgam, forged during Ne Win's early years in power, of a centralized economy, one-party military-backed rule, and Buddhism. Probably as a result of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s colonial past, <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> also sought to exclude foreign influence, including direct involvement by private foreign companies. In recent years, tourists have been allowed to enter the country, but only on seven-day visas. The five leaders who resigned wth Ne Win were <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yu </LOCATION>, party vice chairman and president of the country; <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON>, party secretary-general and vice president; <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, party joint general secretary and secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON>, party central executive committee mamber, deputy prime minister and defense minister, and <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tin </PERSON>, central executive committee members, deputy prime minister and finance minister. They are to retain their government positions until a new government is formed.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Iraqi forces today moved across huge sections of Iranian territory and bombed targets with chemical weapons. The fighting, reported by both countries, came as a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team prepared to travel to both nations to arrange a truce. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio urged all able-bodied Iranians to rush to the front, saying troops were needed to `` thwart <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s new round of mischiefs.'' `` The General Command staff seriously wants all the trained forces that are ready to go to the fronts to apply immediately to resistance bases for rapid dispatch,'' the radio said in a report monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, Iraqi Minister of Information <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusayyib </PERSON> <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON> reacted to the Iranian statement by saying <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had no desire to occupy Iranian territory. `` All we want is to liberate our occupied areas ... We have no aggressive intentions against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops had pushed across the border in the southern front and advanced to within 24 miles of <LOCATION> Ahwaz </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Khuzestan </LOCATION> province and 54 miles from the nearest border. It said hand-to-hand fighting was continuing in the area. Iraqi troops were pushed back in the nearby <LOCATION> Salamcheh </LOCATION> region, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said, with the bodies of `` hundreds of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers scattered on the battlefield.'' In the central sector, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes dropped chemical weapons on two villages between Sar-e <LOCATION> Pol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zahab </LOCATION> and Gilan-e <LOCATION> Gharb </LOCATION> to the south, `` wounding a large number of villagers.'' In an earlier report, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian forces repelled an Iraqi attack at a southern border area west of the Iranian town of <LOCATION> Khorramshahron </LOCATION>. `` The battle now continues between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Moslem soldiers and the invading Iraqis,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that the Iraqis suffered heavy casualties. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the Iranians used long-range artillery to bomb a housing complex in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Sulimaniyeh </LOCATION> province. The report said three civilians were killed and four were wounded in the attack Friday night. The news agency denied an Iranian report that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had shot down an Iraqi jet fighter over the southern front. Both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Iraw </PERSON> rarely let foreign observers near the warfront and reports of fighting can not be independently confirmed. On Friday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary patriarch, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, said the war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was not over despite <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance Monday of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution `` My revolutionary children, you should not think that the war has come to an end. Arm yourselves with the weapons of faith and holy war,'' he said on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it regained on Friday the last remaining territory the Iranians had captured in the eight-year war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accused the Iraqis of using chemical weapons. Both countries accepted an invitation by <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, to send their foreign ministers to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next week for meetings on implementing Resolution 598, which the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed unanimously July 20, 1987. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wants direct negotiations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and the Iranians indicated Friday they may accept such talks if Perez de Cuellar requests it. The Iraqis also said they would welcome a team <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is sending to arrange the details of a cease-fire. The nine military officers and one civilian are due in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on Sunday and expect to be in the region about a week. A military communique read on <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> television Friday said: `` We retook whatever was left of our land from the Iranians'' in an offensive named `` In God We Trust 4.'' It said the victory `` will acelerate the achievement of peace through the signing of a genuine peace treaty via direct talks.'' In the past few months <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has regained large areas that had been captured by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, including the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and marshlands east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> port.

 The drought is even beginning to interfere with good clean fun. Officials of the annual Derby Days festival said the dry conditions this summer made it difficult to find enough frogs to compete in the 33rd Annual State Frog Jumping Contest this weekend. Last year 300 frog trainers ranging in age from 2 to 99 years entered their leapers. But not everyone comes to the competition with their own frog, so contest organizers sell locally raised jumpers for $ 1. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, 76, a contest organizer, said marshes are dry this year and there's been a dramatic decline in the frog population. `` Usually by this time of year we have lots of frogs hopping around, croaking and just having a good time,'' <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> said. `` But not this year.'' Contest organizers called local companies that use frogs for research and asking them to donate competitors, <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> said. `` The woman at one company said ` We have some but they're all bull frogs.' I told her, ` I do n't care what the frogs are full of, I just want frogs,''' <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> joked. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, who has judged the competition for 33 years, said participants have no shame about the way they go about trying to win. Once a frog is put in the jumping circle and the timer is ticking, owners often drop to their knees and coax, cajole, and even sing ballads, trying to persuade their green athletes to jump, she said. `` It is anything but dignified,'' she said. `` Frogs are funny, you know. Sometimes they'll jump forward and then just turn around and jump back again.''

<TEXT>
 A man who was rehired by <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> after serving four years in prison for strangling a co-worker has been charged with killing another co-worker, a woman he allegedly stalked and threatened for weeks. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Landin </PERSON>, who surrendered after the first slaying in 1979, turned himself in again Friday in the shotgun slaying of <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesser </PERSON>, saying `` he'd heard we'd been looking for him,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> of suburban New Hope. Police had launched a search for <PERSON> Landin </PERSON> after <PERSON> Nesser </PERSON>, 25, was slain early Tuesday outside her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION> home, where she lived with her 18-month-old daughter. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morin </PERSON> said he did n't know the specifics of <PERSON> Landin </PERSON>'s rehiring, but `` the philosophy we have is that we do n't discriminate when it comes to hiring practices. Police had been trying to get the victim to file a complaint about threats allegedly made by <PERSON> Landin </PERSON>. ` If I knew then what I know now, I guess we probably would have tried to move heaven and <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> to prevent what happened,'' said <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. <PERSON> Landin </PERSON>, 31, was charged with murder and jailed on $ 1 million bail. In 1980, he pleaded guilty to murdering his girlfriend, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. He was released from prison in 1984 after serving 4 -LCB- years of an eight-year sentence reduced for good behavior and a year spent in jail awaiting trial. <PERSON> Landin </PERSON>, who worked for <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> from 1977 to 1979, when he was indicted in <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s death, was rehired a few weeks after his release. Police said <PERSON> Nesser </PERSON> befriended <PERSON> Landin </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s facility in the suburb of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where they were maintenance workers. <PERSON> Landin </PERSON> told <PERSON> Nesser </PERSON> that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s death was an accident, police said. But <PERSON> Landin </PERSON> began stalking <PERSON> Nesser </PERSON> after she rebuffed his romantic advances, harassing her with phone calls, police said.

Some residents of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Nesser </PERSON> `` was scared to death of the man,'' who frequently visited her home. Neighbors said they heard her phone ring unanswered for hours. On June 30, <PERSON> Nesser </PERSON> complained to her supervisor that she was being harassed by another worker. On July 1, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> officials went to police with <PERSON> Nesser </PERSON>'s concerns and six days later she was reassigned to the company's <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> plant, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nesser </PERSON> also changed her telephone number. <PERSON> Landin </PERSON> telephoned his supervisor on July 7 and resigned, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said police asked <PERSON> Nesser </PERSON> to make a statement about the incidents so they could arrest <PERSON> Landin </PERSON> on charges of making terroristic threats. She was scheduled to make the statement 10 days before she was killed but failed to show, he said. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who talked to <PERSON> Nesser </PERSON> the Friday before her death, said she `` was getting kind of complacent because there had n't been any threats for almost a week since she changed her phone number.'' `` She got some breathing space after her transfer to <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> and she felt that, if she charged him, it would make things worse and she was feeling better,'' he said. On Monday, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> police told him they had not heard from <PERSON> Nesser </PERSON> and had not been able to contact her because her number had been changed. `` If you want to assess real blame, we're all guilty,'' he said. `` He was convicted, he got a sweet deal for no reason. He got out. ... <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> hired him back. This is just a whole series of errors that culminated in a tragedy.'' In a statement issued Friday through <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nesser </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesser </PERSON>, said: `` We are relieved that a suspect in <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>'s murder is now in custody I have no hate for him; it is not in me to feel malice for him, at least not now.''

 No charges will be filed against a woman who killed her husband after he threatened to shot the couple's cocker spaniel, then started beating her when she protested, police said. According to police, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he was fed up with the family's `` useless'' cocker spaniel and asked his wife, <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, `` Where's the gun?''

 <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeths </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> wants to allow presidential assailant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to leave the mental institution for a supervised recreational day trip with other patients, a District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> official said Saturday. The Secret Service, however, is opposing the proposed outing, saying that the 33-year-old <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> remains a threat to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other federal officials that it protects. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> was committed to the hospital in 1982 after he was found innocent by reason of insanity in the March 30, 1981, shooting of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, White House press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent and a <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> policeman. The proposed outing would, except for court appearances, be <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s first trip off the hospital grounds since Dec. 28, 1986, when he received a 12-hour pass to have dinner with his parents. Hospital staffers escorted him. Dr. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, administrator of the forensic services division of the <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said a review board at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeths </ORGANIZATION> has approved <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s participation in an outing to a museum, park or other public place. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, who declined to say when or where the day trip might occur, said that such outings are routine for <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeths </ORGANIZATION> patients once physicians decide they are capable to participating in such activities. `` These activities are considered therapeutic and allow physicians to see how patients are able to handle themselves,'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said outings generally last from two to 12 hours and that there is always at least one staff member for every five patients on a trip. Federal prosecutors have asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> to hold a hearing on the proposed day trip. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who presided at <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s trial, was not consulted about the 1986 pass, and hospital officials agreed to inform him in advance of such activities. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said that <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeths </PERSON> does not inform the courts about impending day trips by other patients committed there as a result of criminal proceedings. `` Mr. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> will benefit therapeutically from participation in this activity,'' the hospital said in a letter to <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. `` It has also been clinically determined that he can participate in this activity without posing a danger to himself or to others.'' <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the agency disagrees. `` We do n't believe he should be released under any conditions,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` We believe him to be a threat to our protectees and will continue to believe that. There's nothing that's been shown to us to indicate he's any different.'' The last time <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeths </PERSON> sought permission for an off-grounds activity for <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> was for an Easter 1987 visit with his parents. The request was dropped after it was disclosed that <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> had corresponded with <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, a convicted serial killer.

 A Soviet newspaper said Saturday that the number of Soviet drug addicts soared from 1985 to 1987, while alcoholism declined. The labor daily <ORGANIZATION> Trud </ORGANIZATION> said that in the two-year period, the number of known alcoholics in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> dropped by 17 percent. However, the newspaper said that in the same period, known cases of drug addiction rose by 150 percent. It did not say exactly when the two-year period began, how many drug addicts the country has or what kind of drugs were being used.

 Welcome Wagon International says an off-color joke in the motion picture `` Big'' infringes on its trademark and casts aspersions on its hostesses. The company, founded and based in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, filed the federal suit Friday against the producers and distributors of the film, seeking an injunction against release of the movie for television or videotape distribution. The action also seeks removal of the reference to Welcome Wagon and payment of unspecified damages to the company. The film, which has already been released, stars <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> and tells the story of a boy who gets his wish to become an adult. `` During -LRB- <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON>' character's -RRB- first day at work, one of his co-workers points to a voluptuous woman who is dressed in red,'' the lawsuit says. The co-worker comments on the woman's sexual prowess, saying, `` She is what we call the company ` Welcome Wagon.''' Welcome Wagon says in the lawsuit that its name is a trademark and that the organization offers advertising to business sponsors via gifts distributed by paid hostesses who visit people in their homes. The reference in the movie conveys a false impression that a typical Welcome Wagon hostess is promiscuous, the lawsuit says. Among the defendants are 20th <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> Partnership II, L.P.; <ORGANIZATION> Gracie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Films </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A national conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> called Saturday for major changes in the nation's guardianship system, including expanded legal rights and representation for the old and disabled. Forty-four experts, including attorneys, psychiatrists, judges, researchers and government officials, also cautioned that judges and lawyers were often `` quantitatively and qualitatively inadequate'' in performing their guardianship duties and recommended greater awareness of flaws in the system. <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> officials attending the National Guardianship Symposium: A Response to The Associated Press Inquiry said the meeting was a result of growing concerns about the nation's guardianship system, including the findings of the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s 50-state investigation of abuses in court-ordered guardianships. `` It's the perception of many professionals that the guardianship system is not meeting the needs of some people and may be abusing the rights of others, as demonstrated by the information in the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> report,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevelowf </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubler </PERSON>, a commissioner with that <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s Commission on the Legal Problems of the Elderly. Last year's AP series found many of the 300,000 to 400,000 elderly under guardianship in this country are stripped of their rights and placed under the power of a guardian without the same court protections given those facing criminal charges. An AP review of 2,200 case files also found the courts often failed to do their job monitoring guardianships, leaving elderly wards prey to financial and physical abuse at the hands of their guardians. The three-day conference issued 36 recommendations for change in the system. Among them: _ Legal representation for all those facing guardianship. The group said attorneys should represent the wishes of clients. The AP investigation found lawyers often dismiss the rights of their clients facing guardianship. _ The elimination of age, economic status, medical diagnosis or `` eccentricity'' as sole reasons for placing someone under guardianship. While many state laws permit guardianships for reasons of age alone, the conference stressed that guardianship be used only when the person can no longer care of themselves. _ Greater efforts by judges, lawyers and court personnel to understand the problems of the elderly. The courts were urged to tailor proceedings for those with poor eyesight or hard of hearing. _ Attempts to find alternatives to guardianship in cases where it does not serve the interests of the proposed ward. The AP study found people are often placed under guardianship to assure payments to nursing homes or limit liability to hospitals. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wexler </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> law professor and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Mentally Disabled said the recommendations come at a time when the guardianship system is coming under greater scrutiny. `` As the population ages and a larger number of people has experience with this system it has to grow in importance,'' he said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, commission director, said the recommendations would go on to various <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> groups for review with hopes that state legislatures and individual courts would amend laws and practices. `` It's one of the first volleys being fired in this issue,'' he said. Since the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s series last fall, some 20 states have either passed or considered legislation to reform guardianship systems in their courts. Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., has drafted legislation setting federal guardianship standards for the courts Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON>, D-Wash., also has drafted recommended standards for the system The conference was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Mentally Disabled and <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Legal Problems of the Elderly and was hosted by the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A group of traditionalist priests and seminarians have broken with renegade Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and are setting up their own organization loyal to the papacy, according to a Roman Catholic magazine. In an interview with the monthly 30 <ORGANIZATION> Giorni </ORGANIZATION>, Abbe <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisig </PERSON> said 16 priests and 20 seminarians have joined the group and `` many others'' are expected. The interview, to appear in the magazine's August issue, was released to the media Saturday. <PERSON> Bisig </PERSON>, a former official in <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> X </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternity </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, said the new organization, called the Priestly Fraternity of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>, was being set up in <LOCATION> Hauterive </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, an 82-year-old Frenchman who heads an ultra-traditionalist movement opposed to modernizing the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, was excommunicated after he consecrated four bishops without papal approval on June 30. The consecration led to the first schism in the church in more than a century. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> warned <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s followers that they also will be excommunicated if they adhere to his movement. But Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> promised to meet their traditionalist needs, including wider use of the 16th century Latin Mass, if they remained loyal to the papacy. `` We want to be tied to the spiritual and liturgical tradition in the church, thus with <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bisig </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` We want to show our brothers that have created the rupture -LRB- with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> -RRB- that they can remain traditionalist Catholics within the church.'' <PERSON> Bisig </PERSON> said he met with the pope and other <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in early July to discuss the new traditionalist fraternity. He said he was promised by Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s guardian of orthodoxy, that the group would receive official <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> recognition `` by September at the latest. `` It is absolutely not our intention to fight with the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> X </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternity </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bisig </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` We are actually very grateful for everything -LRB- <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> -RRB- has done, apart from the schism. He fought against progressivism and modernisn. That is also our objective, but we want to do it within the church.''

 <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, a third-year student at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, was caring for a 10-year-old boy with cancer last year when she noticed his depression over being tutored while other youngsters were out playing. `` I thought, that's something medical students could do _ help kids with their school work while they're at the hospital undergoing chemotherapy,'' said <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> in an interview Saturday. Foster organized a group called Kids in Chemotherapy Support -LRB- KICS -RRB- and passed out a questionnaire to other students to find out how many might want to donate their time. She was amazed by the response _ more than 75 <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> medical students signed up. In order to link young cancer patients with medical students, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> contacted Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, assistant professor of pediatrics at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and chief of pediatric hematology-oncology at the New England Medical Center. So far, seven KICS students and patients have been matched. The program is similar to the Big Brother-Big Sister organization. But the medical students help the children through the kind of difficulties most kids fortunately do n't face. `` The older kids are really concerned about their appearance, such as hair loss or being too thin. Or their faces may be swollen from steroids,'' said Foster. Students learn to help the kids cope with their problems cautiously. `` You ca n't just come right out and ask them how they feel about losing their hair,'' she said. `` But after playing a board game with them four or five times, a lot of kids will confide in you and say they're afraid of cancer.'' Many children spend their eight hours of chemotherapy in the hospital alone, with family or friends. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said she is helping a 15-year-old Vietnamese girl who has Oriental cholangitis, a rare gastrointestinal disorder. The girl lives with her grandmother and other relatives, who attach a social stigman to her illness, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Aho </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the medical school, said school officials were surprised at the number of students who signed up for the program. `` Part of it is they're so anxious to be with patients,'' said <PERSON> Aho </PERSON>. `` They want to help so much. They're looking for that humanitarian aspect in people.'' The students and the children often go on group outings. Last spring, they attended a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> baseball game at Fenway Park. The highlight of the game, said <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, wsa watching seven-year-old <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a KICS child, enjoy the game. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> had a <PERSON> Wilms </PERSON>'s tumor on his kidney but following surgery and chemotherapy, he is cancer-free at this point. He was strong enough to play baseball this spring. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said many of the students have formed close bonds with their young friends and their families. `` When you are assigned to a child, you have that childthe whole time they are undergoing chemotherapy,'' said <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>. `` Some parents have even invited students over for dinner. The students involved in these programs just love it. They would n't give it up for anything.''

 Ne Win, a one-time military hero and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s undisputed ruler for 26 years, relinquished his grip on power in a country shaken by mounting political unrest and economic decline. Citing anti-government rioting and advancing age, Ne Win announced Saturday he was resigning as chairman of the country's sole political party, the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Ne Win, whose name means `` Brilliant as the Sun'' in <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION>, called for a referendum on ending one-party rule that could shake the very political foundations he established after seizing power in a 1962 military coup. Born <PERSON> Shu </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> on May 14, 1911 in the central Burmese town of <LOCATION> Paungbe </LOCATION>, he took the name Ne Win after entering revolutionary politics in what was then a British colony. Ne Win worked briefly as a postal clerk after failing in medical studies. He joined the anti-British movement and became one of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s `` Thirty Comrades,'' who traveled secretly to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for military training in the early days of World War II. Returning to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> and his comrades fought first alongside the Japanese against the British, but then turned against their teachers after realizing that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would also colonize rather than liberate the Burmese. Ne Win rose quickly in the military and became chief of staff of the Burmese armed forces in 1949, the year after <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> gained independence. He came to the political forefront in 1958 when the military pushed aside an ineffective prime minister and established a caretaker government in a country wracked by poverty and ethnic division. As promised, elections were held in 1960. Nu, soon to become Ne Win's archrival, won the post of prime minister. Ne Win, who had the makings of a popular leader, staged a coup in 1962, jailed Nu and vowed to lead his country on a neutralist, egalitarian and moralistic `` <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> to Socialism.'' Once known as a playboy and gambler, Ne Win banned gambling, closed nightclubs and preached strict, traditional morality. This did not stop him from enjoying horse racing or from marrying six times. He moved quickly toward socialism. Private businesses were nationalized, generally with little or no compensation, and the central government attempted to run everything from the vital rice trade to light manufacturing. Foreign private investment ceased, and foreigners were carefully screened before being allowed into the country. Some charged that <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> leaders, including Ne Win, could not shake a post-colonial syndrome that included xenophobia. Ne Win became president under a constitution written in 1974. Although he retired from the military in 1972, Ne Win maintained effective control of the capable, well-organized armed forces that served as his chief instrument of control. When anti-government riots erupted from time to time, Ne Win moved ruthlessly to suppress them. Thousands of dissenters were jailed. Although most were later releaed, there have been persistent allegations of human rights violations. Fearing assassination, Ne Win rarely appeared in public, traveled under tight security and never gave a press conference. He became a recluse and spent much of his time in a heavily-guarded lakeside villa on the edge of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. About the only time <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> residents could catch a glimpse of their leader was inside his heavily guarded limousine on the way to play golf. He also kept potential rivals at bay, by firing or jailing up-and-coming leaders and demanding loyalty from subordinates. Burmese say <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> is both a shrewd, calculating political tactician and a personality given to sudden outbursts of anger. His moves were rarely foreshadowed. His resignation from the presidency in 1981 was unexpected, as was Saturday's announcement that he would step down from his one remaining post, the chairmanship of the party. He cited poor health on the first occasion and advancing age on Saturday. There have been unconfirmed reports of heart, kidney and stomach problems. But after 1981, Ne Win gave no indication that declining health had lessened his grip on power.

 American tourists grumble about prices in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> even as they pitch coins into the Trevi Fountain. The symbolic gesture is supposed to guarantee a return to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, but that is something fewer Americans can afford to do. `` We've been traveling for a month and this is the most expensive place we've been,'' said <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Faris </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nice </ORGANIZATION> were cheaper, and that's surprising.'' Italian tour operators are n't surprised. They say <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is pricing itself out of the market with exorbitant rates and inferior service. The government predicts that compared to last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tourism will drop by more than 6 percent, or 112,000 people. Tourism from other countries is on the rise, and students and backpackers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still jam the streets of <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> and the ferries in the <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> lagoon. The drop-off is among the big spenders. `` We are one of the most expensive countries in the world for hotels and restaurants. And this comes with a very low level of service quality,'' said <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON> <PERSON> di </PERSON> <PERSON> Montezemolo </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> here. `` Our country is very rich in natural and historical beauty, but people are getting a bit tired of the services,'' she said. `` They feel they are being taken for a ride.'' `` Our tourist services are 30 years old. They are too old, too small and not competitive anymore,'' said <PERSON> Enzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Poli </PERSON>, the president of a federation of 2,700 Italian travel agents and tour operators. <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Colombo </PERSON>, the president of the Federation of Italian Hotels, said that compared to last year, the number of foreign tourists in Italian hotels has increased by 5 percent. Ms. <PERSON> di </PERSON> <PERSON> Montezmolo </PERSON> cited a 47 percent increase this year in Japanese tourism due to a favorable exchange rate. But industry officials are concerned about the drop in the number of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION>, who traditionally are among the biggest spenders. `` This year Americans wo n't be the big spenders and they will shorten their vacations in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesaretti </PERSON> of the Aviatur travel agency in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Paloscia </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said his government spent about $ 9.2 million over the past two years to promote <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s image. His office predicts Americans will account for 6 percent of foreign tourism this year and at least 10 percent of the revenue. In 1985, Americans made up about 7 percent of the tourists and 17 percent of the revenue. That was before the rise of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> terrorism in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the fallout from the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear plant accident in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent vacationing Americans elsewhere. The Italian tourism industry discounts the theory that recent acts of terrorism in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, such as the killing of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and an attack on a tourist ship there, are factors in the declining number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tourists. `` Terrorism is not scaring <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tourists anymore,'' said <PERSON> Paloscia </PERSON>. `` Terrorism, pollution, strikes are problems which tourists learn to live with.'' Ms. <PERSON> di </PERSON> <PERSON> Montemezelo </PERSON> agreed, blaming instead the weak position of the dollar. `` This is not connected to terrorism,'' she said. `` The decrease is due mainly to the dollar. Bookings are done mainly in November, and November was the lowest point reached by the dollar.'' The dollar has rebounded from a value of 1,208 lire in November to about 1,365 lire. But officials say that is not enough for people to change their plans. `` <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is extremely expensive, it is one of the most expensive countries in the world,'' said <PERSON> Cesaretti </PERSON> of the Aviatur travel agency. He said that in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, the average price of a night in a first-class hotel is $ 184 to $ 220, while in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> it is $ 95 to $ 110. An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, who asked not to be identified, said a 14-day holiday in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> at a three-star hotel with breakfasts, some dinners and sightseeing tours would cost $ 965 while a comparable tour in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> would cost $ 1,495.

 President <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> on Saturday accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of sending thousands of troops back into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to defend the capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> called it a `` sheer lie'' and said its pullout is continuing. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported meanwhile that Afghan rebels fired six rockets into residential areas of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> Saturday, killing two people, including a 3-year-old girl. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said six people were wounded and several homes destroyed in the third rocket attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in a week. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, the Pakistani army chief of staff, said the Soviets `` decided not only to stop their withdrawal but they have also brought in something like 10,000 troops back from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> was under threat.'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, speaking at a news conference, refused to reveal the source of his information other than to say it came from a `` very reliable source.'' The Soviets agreed in April to withdraw more than 100,000 troops backing the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government in its war with U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, chief of staff, as saying the pullout continues. He described the claims of bringing in 10,000 troops as a `` sheer lie.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said there were `` conflicting reports about a possible reintroduction of Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'' and cited <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>'s statement Saturday that the withdrawal is still in progress. `` The Geneva Accords are clear that the Soviets are to have half their forces out by Aug. 15 and the rest by Feb. 15, 1989. We expect them to comply with this obligation and their commitment to us,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement made available Saturday at the White House press office in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Earlier last week, Western diplomatic sources claimed Soviet troops were taking the lead in the defense of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> after a series of guerrilla attacks. Diplomats, speaking on the usual condition of anonymity, said unconfirmed reports from usually reliable sources claim 4,000 guerrillas have massed on the western edge of the capital and fighting is reported tense on all fronts. Rockets blasted the city Tuesday and Wednesday. Official Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said 15 people were killed Tuesday, and diplomats put the toll at 17. Casualty figures for Wednesday's attack were not available. On Friday, rebels shelled the Afghan city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, killing a woman, a child and two other people, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. The news agency, quoting its Afghan counterpart, <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION>, said nine people were wounded in the attack. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted the Afghan president, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, as calling in a televised speech Saturday for an end to the `` bloodshed and fractracide.'' The agency said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> blamed <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a guerrilla ally, for the increase in attacks. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the government fight the guerrillas. In the U.N.-brokered <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement signed in April, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> agreed in April to withdraw its troops but the rebels, who did not sign the agreement, vowed to fight on. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> denied <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has violated the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. The Afghan government has lodged almost 55 complaints with a U.N monitoring team, accusing <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of harboring guerrillas, supplying them with weapons and allowing a resistance government to establish itself on Pakistani soil.

 <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, tops this year's Money magazine survey of the 300 best areas in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to live, edging out last year's winner, <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION> moved from fifth place to the top of the list because of a lower crime rate, slightly better schools and its proximity to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s museums, theaters and top-flight hospitals, Money said in its August issue. <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, with 60,470 residents, is about 55 miles northeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think it's great. It makes us feel good,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is headquartered in <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>. But a shopper on <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>'s Main Street questioned the ranking. `` I do n't know why,'' said the woman, who identified herself only as <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. `` It's boring. When we want to do something, we go into the -LRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -RRB- city.'' The rating also was questioned in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which came in last. `` It's almost a laughing matter to me,'' said Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Usry </PERSON>. `` I think some of the data or statistics or research they used is faulty. I have made my home here and I'm proud of the progress being made here.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was rated 19th, up from 82nd last year. `` Naturally, we would still think it's too low _ because we think it's No. 1,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Conors </PERSON>, spokeswoman for Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. In order, the top 10 regions are <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>; central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Passaic </LOCATION> counties in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` Being top dog is always preferable to sixth place, but we do n't feel too bad nestled between <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Valuk </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Industry, which includes the <ORGANIZATION> Nashua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. The `` streaking stars'' included midwestern cities with growing economies _ such as <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, up from 83 last year to 22, and <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, up from 104 to 31. <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, inched up from the bottom of the list to 293. Flint residents were `` pretty steamed up'' about last year's survey _ some even burned copies of the magazine, noted Managing Editor <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Areas that plummeted this year tended to be relatively crime-free and inexpensive towns plagued by weak economies, such as <LOCATION> Houma-Thibodaux </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, down from 11 last year to 128; <LOCATION> Scranton-Wilkes-Barre </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, down from 9 to 114; and Wheeling, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, down from 3 to 45 `` I do n't think it's -LRB- the economy -RRB- any weaker than when we were named No. 3,'' said Wheeling Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baller </PERSON>. `` I do n't know how they come up with these figures.'' Money staffers sifted through government and private data on the nation's largest metropolitan statistical areas, ranking their crime, housing, health, economy, arts, education, transit, weather and leisure activities. They visited the top and bottom 10 regions. Even top-rated <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION> had its drawbacks. A three-bedroom house there typically costs $ 175,000 or more _ not unusual, considering each of the top 10 area scored poorly in the housing price category. By contrast, the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area _ No. 300 this year _ `` has a marvelous, five-mile stretch of boardwalk beachfront, stately houses in surrounding towns and an outstanding public library,'' the magazine said. The `` Bottom 10'' among the 300 are <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; Janesville-Beloit, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Search For Marcos' Wealth Hampered By Corruption Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The resignation of a top official, charges of corruption and internal squabbling are hampering efforts to recover billions of dollars that <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> allegedly stole during his 20 years in office. There are even calls for scuttling the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Good Government, or <ORGANIZATION> PCGG </ORGANIZATION>, which President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> created two years ago to recover up to $ 10 billion in assets that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates are accused of taking. The commission is fighting for control of bank accounts, stock and real estate scattered throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, including about $ 350 million in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate. But so far, the commission says it has gained control of only $ 300 million in various assets in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. All but $ 60 million worth are subject to lengthy litigation. One commission member, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Laureta </PERSON>, told reporters that at the current pace, it might take 100 years to retrieve the money `` if we're lucky.'' `` If we're unlucky, 300 years,'' he added. `` Only <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and -LRB- his wife <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> -RRB- are laughing ...,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Albano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacis </PERSON> in the Philippine Daily Inquirer. `` The present difficulties of the <ORGANIZATION> PCGG </ORGANIZATION> must have been the first good news the Marcoses have received since they arrived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>.'' The Marcoses have lived in exile there since his ouster from the presidency in February 1986. The crisis in the five-member commission reached a climax Tuesday when Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> announced the resignation of its chairman, <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, a former insurance executive with an untarnished reputation for personal honesty, quit in disgust after Solicitor-General <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> accused the commission of incompetence and a `` trail of corruption.'' <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> made his accusation in the wake of a graft charge against commission member <PERSON> Quintin </PERSON> <PERSON> Doromal </PERSON>, who allegedly used his influence to win a government contract for a firm owned by his family. <PERSON> Doromal </PERSON>, who denied the charge, is to be arraigned before an anti-graft court early next month. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said in a letter to his staff that he resented being `` toyed around.'' He also claimed that relatives of unnamed `` powers that be'' interfered with the commission to free assets seized by the commission. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>'s replacement, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuna </PERSON>, already has come under fire because he was a partner in a law firm once retained by <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Romualdez </PERSON>, younger brother of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, and former ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during his brother-in-law's administration <PERSON> Romualdez </PERSON>'s assets were among those seized by the commission. Following <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>'s resignation, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ordered an audit of all assets taken over by the commission. They range from businesses, stock, real estate, bank deposits, planes, automobiles and jewelry. Some of the last three have allegedly disappeared. Members of the House of Representatives have called for a separate probe. Speaker <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is to debate several bills calling for scuttling the commission or curbing its powers. The commission has long been accused of corruption in the handling of companies or shares of stock seized on suspicion they were illegally acquired by the Marcoses or their associates. The commission was responsible not only for tracking down and identifying companies controlled by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates but also with administering them. Critics say that has given corrupt officials the opportunity to rake off corporate funds. Commission officials have acknowledged corruption among some of the commission's 200 `` fiscal agents'' and have filed charges against six of them. In one case, members of a company board of directors appointed by the commission allegedly voted themselves car loans using corporate funds. Another case involves the disappearance of hundreds of head of cattle from a sequestered ranch. The current crisis complicates what was already an awesome task of unraveling a web of dummy companies, laundered funds and aliases allegedly used by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates to loot the treasury. Newspaper columnist <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunanan </PERSON> described the corruption charges against the commission as exaggerated. But she acknowledged its reputation had been so tarnished it deserves a `` mercy killing.'' `` Motives aside, I think <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should really abolish the <ORGANIZATION> PCGG </ORGANIZATION> at this stage,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cunanan </PERSON> said. `` The exit of <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> and his replacement, even on a temporary capacity, by presidential legal adviser <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuna </PERSON> ... just about shattered whatever credibility is left of the <ORGANIZATION> PCGG </ORGANIZATION>.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Iraqi troops backed by tanks, warplanes and chemical weapons pushed nearly 40 miles across the border Saturday and it called on all able-bodied fighters to rush to the front. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its aim was to capture a large number of prisoners before cease-fire talks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

A later report from the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces `` began withdrawing from freshly captured Iranian territory after moving captured Iranian war equipment and prisoners behind the lines.'' It gave no figures on the number of prisoners taken or casualties but said the Iraqis attacked a military camp in <LOCATION> Hamid </LOCATION> and `` inflicted huge losses in men and equipment.'' The agency said other Iraqi forces in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also would withdraw after achieving similar objectives. The reports of fighting came as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> teams prepared to visit the warring nations to work out implementation of a cease-fire in the nearly 8-year-old war. The military observers were expected to arrive in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the Iranian capital, Sunday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops crossed into southern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and headed toward the oil city of <LOCATION> Ahvaz </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian forces blocked another <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> advance 15 miles to the west. The heaviest battles were around the towns of <LOCATION> Hamid </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jofair </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khushk </PERSON> west of <LOCATION> Ahvaz </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Shalamcheh </LOCATION> a little farther north and the northern suburbs of the Iranian port city of <LOCATION> Khorramshahr </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. Iranian television broke into its regular newscast to announce that `` our Moslem combatants forced the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces to retreat'' from those towns. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iraqi troops had been pushed back in the <LOCATION> Shalamcheh </LOCATION> region, with the bodies of `` hundreds of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers scattered on the battlefield.'' It said the tank-led `` Iraqi invasion'' was backed by heavy artillery fire, chemical weapons, jet fighters and helicopter gunships and was aimed at occupying <LOCATION> Khorramshahr </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ahvaz </LOCATION>. The Iranian dispatch said 5,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed or wounded and 200 tanks or armored personnel carriers were captured. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the town of <LOCATION> Gilan-e </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gharb </LOCATION>, 20 miles inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and about 110 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, fell to <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops who used chemical weapons. `` The aggressors also captured Sar-e Pol Zahab garrison using the same dastardly tactic,'' the agency said. The towns are in a disputed border area claimed by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> under the terms of a 1975 agreement with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` All we want is to liberate our occupied areas,'' Iraqi Information Minister <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` We have no aggressive intentions against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON>, quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also aimed to take as many Iranian prisoners as possible `` to facilitate the achievement of a lasting and comprehensive peace.'' There were no Iraqi comments on the Iranian claims that it used chemical weapons in the fighting. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has in the past admitted using the outlawed weapons but said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> used them first. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> denied that. President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has said the capture of a large number of Iranians would help in negotiations on a cease-fire based on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolution 598. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced last week that it was accepting the resolution, adopted one year ago. On Friday, both countries accepted an invitation by <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, to send their foreign ministers to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this week for meetings on the resolution, which provides for a cease-fire, withdrawal to recognized borders, a prisoner exchange and peace talks. The resolution also calls for an investigation of which side started the war. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> captured 8,635 prisoners in fighting Friday. According to figures released last week by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> holds about 13,000 Iranian prisoners while <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> holds about 50,000 Iraqis. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, interrupted its regular programming to urge all able-bodied Iranians to rush to the front. `` Oh proud nation of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> ... make haste to courageously confront the savage onslaught of the enemy. Turn towards the fronts,'' the radio said. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian fighter-bombers flew 25 missions Saturday morning, heavily bombing Iraqi positions in the southern and central areas. It said an Iraqi jet fighter was hit by anti-aircraft fire over the southern front and `` the aircraft disintegrated in the air.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> denied one of its aircraft had been shot down.

 The rupture and explosion of two underground gas pipelines forced the temporary evacuation of 200 people and and left a crater 30 feet in diameter and 25 feet deep in a highway, authorities said Saturday.

<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> headed home to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Saturday, leaving town in a decidedly more low-key manner than he entered and maintaining that his failed presidential campaign made history at the Democratic National Convention. The civil rights leader refused to speculate on whether he would seek public office again, saying that his priority now is to work for the Democratic ticket in the fall presidential race. `` My focus now is on the fall campaign,'' he told reporters as he left a downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hotel. `` We'll be spending a lot of time organizing for voter registration, issue interpretation, involving people _ many for the first time _ and a big turnout for the fall campaign.'' Of his post-election plans, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` We'll have to determine what will happen, based on the outcome of the campaign. But we take this journey one phase at a time.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took members of his family, campaign staffers and journalists who covered his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination to <PERSON> Paschal </PERSON>'s, a well-known, black-owned hotel and restaurant for lunch. The entourage then headed for <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where a chartered jet took off shortly after 2 p.m. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, dressed in cuffed blue jeans, sandals and a red, white and blue shirt, appeared at ease, accepting well-wishers and posing for photographers. A few reporters and photographers covered his departure and about 10 people gathered at the airport to bid <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> farewell. The casual scene contrasted sharply with the thunderous entrance to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> made by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> one week earlier. A motorcade of buses brought the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> July 16, two days before the start of the Democratic convention. He addressed thousands of cheering supporters in <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, asserting that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, then assured of the nomination, must give <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a stronger voice in the party. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and vice presidential nominee Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> met on Monday and peace was made. Though <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s name was placed in nomination at the convention, he later pledged support for the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Saturday his campaign made great gains in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. He said blacks and others previously outside the party mainstream will have unprecedented involvement in the fall campaign. And he noted that several <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> platform positions were adopted. `` We can leave <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> with a real sense of inspiration because of the expansion of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, more inclusion, involvement in the campaign at all levels, vertically and horizontally. And also helping to determine the course, the priorities _ being in the room where poilicy is debated and priorities are set. `` This is a trmemendous moment for us,'' he said.

 As many as 10,000 Serbs rallied Saturday to demand constitutional changes that would give <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic, more control, <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio and witnesses said. The rally in <LOCATION> Pancevo </LOCATION> backed <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s communist leader, <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who wants the republic to be given greater authority over two of its provinces, <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. Those two provinces were granted wide autonomy by the Yugoslav Constitution adopted under the late President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>. The demonstrators, most Vojvodina Serbs, had expected to be joined by Serbs from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> for the rally in <LOCATION> Pancevo </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> town 12 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio said the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> Serbs decided against attending the demonstration to comply with a call by the <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> presidium Wednesday for an end to the protest rallies. Two weeks ago <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> Serbs held a rally in <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>'s capital of Novi Sad but received little support from <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> Serbs. <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>'s leadership last week claimed <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> was behind the Novi Sad demonstration.

 A pet piglet that led police on a three-hour chase was finally nabbed by a farm agent who got down on the ground and lured the animal with a handful of horse feed. `` It's easy _ you just have to be faster than the pig,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> `` Hi-Ho'' <PERSON> Hrabovsky </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Hillsborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Blackie </PERSON>, an 8-month-old, 40-pound pig, spent the night behind bars at the city's impoundment lot before being sent to the sheriff's farm for `` wayward'' animals in <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The pig's brush with the law began as owner <PERSON> David </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> carried him along a city street late Thursday night. Officer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> stopped to chat, and soon learned through a computer check that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was wanted for violating probation on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol.

About 2 a.m. Friday, they called <PERSON> Hrabovsky </PERSON>. `` I was asleep when they called and asked if I could come catch a pig,'' said <PERSON> Hrabovsky </PERSON>, who arrived to find police and the pig in a standoff. `` I got down on the ground with him and took a handful of horse feed and waited for him,'' he said. When the pig came to <PERSON> Hrabovsky </PERSON>, officers nabbed it. `` I tried to take <PERSON> Blackie </PERSON> with me, but the officers said they had to take him so I just put him in the back seat of their car,'' <PERSON> Hrabovsky </PERSON> said. `` I guess they did n't know the procedure ... being their first time and all that.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> remained in the <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> late Friday, and no hearing date or bail had been set. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Hrabovsky </PERSON> took <PERSON> Blackie </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The pig will be auctioned off if <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> does n't claim him in 40 days, but <PERSON> Hrabovsky </PERSON> said he'd try to place <PERSON> Blackie </PERSON> with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s family. `` This is one gentle pig,'' he said.

 Businesses in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> tried to make up for lost time Saturday after a crippling strike, but a walkout continues in a disputed Armenian region of a neighboring republic, Soviet news reports said. State-run television reported Saturday in its evening news program `` Vremya'' that 54,000 businesses in the Armenian capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, that normally stay closed on weekends had opened. The extra hours were aimed at catching up after a strike that began July 4 and tapered off last week, the program said. But the broadcast said a strike continued in the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> Saturday despite a televised appeal by the local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief for Armenians to return to work. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said the situation remains tense in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, where residents have been on strike since May 23 as they demand the incorporation of their district into <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. On Monday the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's top executive body, refused to alter the status of the district, which has a predominantly Armenian population but no common borders with the Armenian republic. In another development, the wife of <PERSON> Paruyr </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, a jailed Armenian activist the Presidium ordered expelled Wednesday, said she had learned he was taken from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, in a telephone interview, said it was not clear whether her husband would be sent out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agent reported the activist's transfer in a meeting Friday with a sister of <LOCATION> Ayrikyan </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, a leader of an Armenian nationalist group, was arrested March 25 on a charge of defaming the state and imprisoned in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. In ordering him exiled, the Presidium stripped <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> of his Soviet citizenship and pardoned him. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has said Soviet officials have contacted them about resettling <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he has relatives. Mrs. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said she had not been allowed to speak to her husband and did n't know whether he might be headed for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> claimed Saturday that <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> appealed to the Presidium June 1 to drop the criminal charges against him and allow him to emigrate to the West. It accused Ayrikyan of advocating more serious changes than annexing <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, Armenian activists called for a resumption of the general work stoppage to protest the Presidium's rejection of their annexation demand. But <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> residents and the state-run media have indicated people were generally ignoring the strike call.

 Thousands of Jews gathered at the Wailing Wall Saturday to pray amid tight security after Palestinians battled police in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Police fired rubber bullets and arrested 14 Palestinians during clashes in which one Israeli and a Palestinian were injured, according to broadcast reports. They said police used tear gas to break up an anti-Arab demonstration by Jewish militants. The fighting came as Jews and Moslems were beginning religious celebrations this weekend centering on the same site in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Such skirmishes have made this disputed city a part of the seven-month-old <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The Israelis seized control of Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. Israeli television reported that many rabbis throughout the country urged worshipers to attend prayer services at the Wailing Wall and not be frightened away by Palestinian violence. Hundreds of riot police patrolled east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as Jews began observing <PERSON> Tisha </PERSON> B ` Av, which marks the destruction of the Holy Temple by the Romans 2,000 years ago. Services were conducted at the Wailing Wall, a retaining wall of the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> and the only remnant of the ancient Jewish temple. Later this weekend Moslems begin celebrating the four-day Eid al-Adha festival that commemorates the story of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>'s planned sacrifice of his son on the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, which they call <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharif </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> instead sacrificed a sheep. With its importance to both faiths, the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> area has become one of the flashpoints of the Israeli-Arab conflict. Some people who have prayed at the Wailing Wall in previous years said there were fewer worshipers this year. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, a tourist from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said she would not `` let a little rock-throwing keep me from the holiest place in Judaism. I am here because if we do n't come, they'll win.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> suffered head injuries during a battle involving Arabs, police and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> students from a seminary in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Moslem quarter. It said the violence began after a memorial procession attended by hundreds of Palestinians for 15-year-old <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabadi </PERSON> who was fatally shot Tuesday on the northern outskirts of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Fighting spread to the <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> Gate, one of the main entrances to the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address, given this week by Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>: Good afternoon. This is Congressman <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON><PERSON> , </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, from the Fourth Congressional District in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. As chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, I'd like to visit with you about the renewed spirit within the Democratic party. As Democrats leave <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> where we held our national convention this week and scatter from one corner of our nation to the other, the enthusiasm for the Democratic party is spreading like wildfire across the prairie. It's a spirit we have n't felt since <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> filled us with hope and provided opportunities to all working men and women. In 1988, we have another Massachusetts-Texas team just as dedicated and just as capable of getting the country back on the right track. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, we nominated a presidential ticket of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Governor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Senator <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Today, the Dukakis-Bentsen team will carry its message of hope and opportunity to the valley of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and then, move on to the plains of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, Democrats recaptured a sense of party unity that has been missing for too long, and while we celebrated solidarity, we also debated. Democrats in 1988 can debate without becoming divided for a simple reason _ we share a deep commitment to fulfilling the needs and challenges of all Americans, not just our closest friends. After eight years of a Republican administration, fueled by selfish and sometimes unlawful motives, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are looking for a return to the basic values of common respect, compassion, and concern for all. And as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised, we are determined to forge a new era of greatness. This fall, the Republicans will brag about low unemployment, low inflation and sustained growth. But you and I know, we've paid a big price for their bragging rights. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> have paid dearly with plant shutdowns. In our heartland, it's a daily struggle for farmers to keep their farms. And if you brag about sustained growth in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, the folks there would laugh, or maybe cry. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was right eight years ago when he called <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policies `` voodoo economics.'' He seems to have forgotten that, and forgotten the needs of the working men and women of this country. Soon, Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may begin to feel like a voodoo doll, when he is stuck with explaining his administration's legacy of debts and deficits. Voters who supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are now disillusioned because this administration could n't keep its promises. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will pay the price as many of these supporters return home where they belong _ to the Democratic party. We're already hearing from these folks. From <LOCATION> Desha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, a farmer friend called me recently. He said: `` <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON>, I'm sorry I voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. I'll do it again. Now, I need your help.'' My reply was simple: `` There's no need to apologize Just remember how empty those promises were and that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will try to hoodwink the public again.'' Throughout most of the 1980s, Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were the safety net for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. We fought to protect your basic rights. It was difficult at times, but our efforts have paid off. It was Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who crusaded far and fast for catastrophic health insurance. It was Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who initiated in fast trade legislation to protect American jobs for opening more world markets. It was Democrats who said it's only fair and decent to give workers 60 days notice when they lose their jobs. And Democrats even cooperated with the President in strengthening our national defense. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took it too far to the point where crime corruption and greed set in. Clearly, the priorities of the last eight years served the interest of ambitious <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointees and the elite of our society. This administration favors missile systems over school systems and supports payments to international drug-traffickers, but does n't fund programs to stop drugs at our borders. I think you'll agree, it's time to straighten out our priorities National security is no longer simply a debate over missiles and troops _ it's a concern for the American family. It's a renewal of the dream that our children will have greater opportunities. Every American deserves the right to share the same hopes and dreams _ the hope that all of our children will receive quality education, that adequate health is available for all, that all our children will be able to afford to buy a house, and that all our children's children will have a better quality of life These hopes will remain just dreams if you, my fellow Americans, do n't get involved in the political process. The 1988 election will be one of the most important ones in our lifetime. It's the Democratic commitment to invest in our most precious natural resource _ the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people _ that will propel this nation into the next century. Do n't ever forget _ your vote is important. In November, vote Democratic. Our future depends on it. Thank you for listening.

<HEAD>Land Purchase Nearly Doubles State Parkland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' largest parkland acquisition in history, the massive Big Bend Ranch, is putting the state <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> into high gear. The $ 8.8 million purchase nearly doubles the state parks system. `` It's a bargain,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` This great property will provide a new and exciting opportunity for the citizens of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to enjoy one of the state's wildest and most beautiful places.'' The purchase of the 215,000-acre ranch in <LOCATION> Brewster </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> counties in western <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ends a 15-year struggle by former state Land Commissioner <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> to acquire the property. The parks system now has about 220,000 acres of land. `` It's really a unique area and we plan to keep it that way,'' said <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, now a commission member. `` It's unreal how many outstanding geological features the ranch has.'' The ranch includes the Solitario, an extinct volcano with an 8-mile diameter, and is known to provide habitats for at least 11 endangered species of plants and animals. The purchase, approved by the commission Thursday, is expected to be completed within three weeks. Title to the ranch is held by <ORGANIZATION> Humble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mischer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. As land commissioner in the late 1970s, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> negotiated a trade of state lands for the ranch. But the swap was opposed by several legislators and never completed. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> described the ranch as one of the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>'s most significant natural resources. Covering about 336 square miles, it is about one-third the size of nearby Big Bend National Park. The ranch is about 350 miles southeast of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report: Three Drunk Policemen Disrupt Mass</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three drunk policemen entered a church linked to the outlawed Solidarity union and disrupted a Mass before being evicted by worshipers, a Solidarity spokeswoman said Saturday. A scuffle broke out during the service Friday night at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojciechowicz </PERSON>, speaking from her home in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port city. She said one officer threw a knife and another used his truncheon to ward off angry worshipers but the policemen, all in uniform, were subdued and removed from the building. Police summoned by the parish priest, the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, later located the three officers and detained them, according to the spokeswoman. A duty officer at <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> police headquarters declined to comment about the incident. The church is a few blocks from the Lenin shipyard where Solidarity was founded in the fall of 1980 to become the only free union federation in the Soviet bloc. Solidarity was suspended by the communist government in December 1981 and subsequently outlawed. There have been frequent pro-Solidarity demonstrations at the church.

<HEAD>Man Cheered by Reinstatement of Lawsuit over Products Derived from
His Blood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A soft-drink distributor who maintains he should get some of the profits from commercial products derived from his blood and body tissues says he is pleased by a court ruling that may lead to that. `` To me, this -LRB- ruling -RRB- is the ultimate vindication of the rightness of what we're trying to do,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said Friday after learning the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> 2nd <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reinstated his suit against the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 43, claims Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Golde </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> never informed him of the value of his blood while using it to develop a product that scientists say offers considerable hope for treating cancer and AIDS. His attorney in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zackey </PERSON>, said the ruling was unprecedented. `` This is the first time an appellate court has ruled that a patient has an interest in the unique properties of his genetic material and that commercial exploitation without the patient's consent entitles the patient to sue for damages,'' <PERSON> Zackey </PERSON> said Private research companies paid <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> $ 500,000 for exclusive access to <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s cells, <PERSON> Zackey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Golde </PERSON> received benefits worth about $ 1.5 million, and trade sources have indicated the full line of treatments that could be developed from the cells might be worth more than $ 3 billion, the lawyer added. An attorney for <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, said he might seek reconsideration of the ruling or seek an appeal. Twelve years ago, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> learned he had a rare blood disease called hairy-cell leukemia, and in a relatively common treatment, <PERSON> Golde </PERSON> removed his spleen. From that organ, <PERSON> Golde </PERSON> discovered <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s blood possessed a previously unknown capacity for fighting disease, and for the next seven years he had the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> man frequently return to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to draw more blood. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he never was told that researchers used his blood and tissues to patent what they called the `` Mo-cell.'' The product was developed by copying a unique characteristic found in <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s cells, a property that boosts production of certain white blood cells which, in turn, stimulate the body's first line of defense against some diseases When patients consent to the removal of organs, they also consent to disposal of the organs, including their use in research, so <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> `` had abandoned any interests in the therapeutically removed tissue,'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. Since his spleen was removed, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has undergone no further treatment and says the disease appears to be in remission.

<HEAD>Vets Returning to Vietnam to Clear Mine Fields</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Spurred by reports that land mines are maiming and killing Vietnamese children, five veterans intend to return to <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to help clear mine fields they laid 20 years ago. `` I do n't consider myself a Rambo type, and I do n't consider myself a <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>,'' former Cpl. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Noe </PERSON> said Saturday. `` I did what I had to do, what I was told to do, during the war. `` And I'm doing what I feel is right to do now.'' <PERSON> Noe </PERSON>, a 39-year-old firefighter in <LOCATION> Stoughton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and four fellow veterans of the 11th Marine Combat Engineering Battalion have received the Vietnamese government's approval for a two-week humanitarian mission in January. They plan to point out the perimeters of the fields they laid, provide technical expertise on mines and, if necessary, comb the jungle with metal detectors and probe the dirt with knives. <PERSON> Noe </PERSON> said they realize their actions may be dangerous and have asked the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> to reduce the risk by turning over maps of the fields. But a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the maps either never reached the Pentagon or were tossed out long ago. `` If we kept everything back that far, this city would be buried under paper,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> public affairs office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. If that means the veterans have to rely on memories two decades old, so be it, said former <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Cpl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Genna </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` I wo n't remember all the fields, but I'll remember the ones I worked on,'' <PERSON> Genna </PERSON> said. `` You'd be surprised how well you recall when you had ears on the back of your head and eyes on your rear end.'' Plans for the trip emerged from a September 1987 reunion in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Genna </PERSON> showed his companions a newspaper article in which the Vietnamese government estimated 3,000 people _ many of them children _ died from grenades, bombs and land mines between 1975 and 1985. Former Sgt. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, who organized the reunion, said the news hit him hard. `` I turned to one former battalion commander and said, ` Sir, did you take the mine fields out?,' and he said, ` No.' `` So I turned to the other battalion commander who relieved him and I said, ` Did you?' And he said, ` No.' So I said, ` My God, all these years have gone by, and we're still killing people over there,'' recalled <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON>. After the reunion, <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON>, 40, contacted the Vietnamese mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, wrote to other veterans and found an anonymous donor willing to support the mine-clearing expedition, which the veterans estimate will cost $ 30,000. Besides <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Genna </PERSON>, the veterans who have volunteered are <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Langdon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>. All five served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> between 1967 and 1970 The group's translator and guide will be retired Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, who went to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> last fall to help plan the mission. `` I'm supporting them because it's a humanitarian effort I agree with,'' <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> said. `` I see this as an act of a reconciliation between two governments that have been at odds for a long time _ and who better to do it than the young men who were sent to fight the war in the first place.''

 A bomb blew up Saturday on a road near the Irish border and killed three members of a family headed home after a vacation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, police said. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, admitted it was their bomb but that it detonated prematurely and was meant for British soldiers, not civilians. The blast blew a crater in the road and left bodies and luggage scattered on the main road between <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, witnesses said. Killed in the explosion were <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>, both 44, and their son <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 6. They were driving to their home in <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION>, 12 miles south of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, when the explosion occurred at about 10 a.m. near <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION>, about a mile from the Irish border, police said. It was not immediately known where they vacationed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Three people in nearby cars were slightly injured. The explosion brought to 21 the number of people killed in explosions in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> this year, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to drive the British out of the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province and unite it with the Roman Catholic Irish Republic. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> issued conflicting statements explaining the bombing. In a statement issued to journalists in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armagh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Hannas </ORGANIZATION> were the `` unfortunate victims of mistaken identity.'' It said the attack was a carefully planned military operation that ended in `` tragic and unfortunate circumstances.'' A later <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statement said British scanning devices may have set off the device, which was planned for British soldiers. `` This bomb which was to be detonated by remote control exploded prematurely, tragically killing three civilians,'' it said. `` We are in a position to state that all volunteers in command of the explosives did not detonate the device. Without shirking responsibility for this tragedy, we are investigating the possibility that the explosion could have occurred as a result of British forces who were in the vicinity using electronic scanning devices,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said. Officials speculated the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> mistook the family's jeep for a Land Rover used by British security forces. Security forces regularly patrol the area. The Royal Ulster Constabulary denounced the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statement. Police described <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> as a company director. They said the couple had a 17-year-old son and an 19-year-old daughter who were not traveling with them. The <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> family, in a statement later Saturday, said they were `` stunned and hurt'' and wished to mourn in private. British security forces sealed off the area. `` When I came out from getting petrol, I saw parts of bodies lying all over the road,'' a witness said. `` A -LRB- jeep -RRB- was blown into a field and two other cars were damaged,'' another witness said. `` From what I could see there were a couple of cars lying in the crater. There was debris everywhere,'' said another witness. All spoke on condition of anonymity. A nearby abandoned house was demolished in the explosion. The blast occurred near the spot where a <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> judge and his wife were killed by an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb 15 months ago. Three years ago, four <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> officers were killed by a bomb at almost the same spot. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, a former legislator in the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> `` would react with another sickening apology for the deaths of three innocent people.'' On July 8, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> apologized for killing two civilians, who died along with a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldier and an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla during two bombings and two mortar attacks. An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statement said the operation went `` tragically wrong.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> of the non-sectarian <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> described the bombers Saturday as savages and said they could only be defeated `` if the community act against terrorism.''

<HEAD>Hungarian Intellectuals Fast in Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of intellectuals prayed and fasted Saturday to pressure authorities to ease travel restrictions, news reports said. The reports of the hunger strike followed an announcement by Premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> earlier last week that his communist government was preparing to lift such restrictions on people sentenced for participating in the 1956 anti-communist uprising. The rebellion was put down by Soviet tanks. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who became national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in a major reshuffle in May, began a 10-day <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit on Tuesday. The hunger strikers started Tuesday and reportedly intended to carry out their protest for the duration of his visit. The <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper carried an interview with the hunger strikers, and a popular Saturday afternoon radio news program allowed them to broadcast their grievances. The reports did not say how many people were taking part in the protest. <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> also quoted <PERSON> Ferenc </PERSON> <PERSON> Koeszeg </PERSON>, editor of the underground journal <PERSON> Beszeloe </PERSON>, as saying the strikers wanted to appeal to public opinion after repeated applications for passports were refused. The Saturday radio news magazine `` 168 hours'' reported that the hunger strikers had addressed a letter to the justice minister and intended to send another to the government asking that citizen's rights be better guaranteed The news media were taking advantage of a new government policy, initiated under <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, allowing greater dissent.

 Police were looking Saturday for a cream-colored pickup truck that may be linked to an explosion that damaged the east entrance to <ORGANIZATION> Loogootee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The Friday night blast created enough force to destroy a metal door and hurl pieces of the bomb up to 100 yards away, police said. No injuries were reported in the 9:45 p.m. explosion, which was heard over the entire town. Damage was estimated by police at $ 500. An older model pickup truck, which had a darker-colored stripe along the side, was seen near the school at the time of the explosion, state police dispatcher <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weintraut </PERSON> said. `` We're waiting on an <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> bomb investigator to come up this morning for further investigation,'' said <PERSON> Loogootee </PERSON> Chief of Police <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>. On July 5, 13 improperly wired time bombs were found in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, about 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Loogootee </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. There was no evidence the two incidents were related, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. The Salem incident involved dynamite improperly wired to timed fuses. None of those bombs exploded. The Loogootee bomb was a fused pipe bomb that was lit by someone shortly before it went off, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. The only similarities were that neither bomber knew how to wire a bomb correctly, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. `` Whoever made these bombs here did n't know what they were doing,'' he said. `` The state investigator said whoever made the bomb was real lucky it did n't explode while they were making it.'' Earlier this month, police discovered an unfinished pipe bomb in the center of an intersection about a block from the school. `` It looked like someone had made it and it fell out of a vehicle or something,'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. `` It looked like someone had been experimenting, trying to make something like a homemade bomb, but did n't get it finished. It did n't have any powder, was n't fused. `` The school teachers are starting to get worried,'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. `` They do n't know if they want to go back to school or not.'' Police talked to several teachers and neighbors Saturday, but none reported receiving any threats, he said. Said one local officer who spoke on condition he not be identified: `` What we are afraid of is that whoever is doing this is practicing and the bombs might get bigger and bigger. We hope it stops right now before someone gets hurt.''

<HEAD>New Dade County Teacher Contract Sets Top Pay At $64,000</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Teachers could earn up to $ 64,000 under a tentative contract agreement with <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> that a schools spokesman describes as one of the nation's `` most progressive'' and raises salaries 28 percent. The three-year contract, which the teachers' union and school board must still approve, sets average pay for the new academic year at $ 33,066, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school spokesman <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gollan </PERSON> said Saturday. Average pay nationally is $ 28,031, according to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> figures. `` We believe this is very far reaching, aside from salary considerations,'' <PERSON> Gollan </PERSON> said after negotiators reached a settlement. `` There's an increased voice for teachers in a number of areas, for example in the selection of principals. We believe this to be the most progressive teacher contract in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' With 255,000 students in 260 schools, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has the fourth-biggest school district in the nation, behind <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dade </PERSON>'s school system, with 15,000 teachers, received national attention earlier this year because of a program that gives local schools more autonomy and lets teachers' councils help make decisions. The program also aims to improve inner-city schools by involving various community organizations, offering Saturday classes and various professional growth initiatives. <PERSON> Gollan </PERSON> said the school system enthusiastically favors generous raises, so that overall salaries would average $ 33,066 in the first year of the contract, $ 36,042 in the second and $ 39,646 in the third. A new teacher would receive $ 23,000 yearly, and an educator with 14 years of experience and a doctorate, who teaches summer school, could earn up to $ 64,000 under the proposed pay scale, he said. `` It's a nationally recognized idea that teachers should be paid more for the work they do,'' <PERSON> Gollan </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared Saturday that he would win both the South and the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, despite concentrated efforts in the region by the new Democratic team and a shortage of campaign funds that he called troublesome. Standing on the bank of the drought-depressed <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president proclaimed, `` If we are successful in getting the truth out there, they -LRB- Democrats -RRB- will be unsuccessful in drawing the traditional <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> back into the fold.'' `` I have to help get the truth out there,'' he added. Both regions went solidly for the Reagan-Bush ticket in both 1980 and 1984. The `` truth'' the prospective <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee said he wants to spread would be his `` major philosophical differences with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' whom he called a `` traditional liberal.'' However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he does not see similar differences with Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He said he agrees with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> on most issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is on a two-day campaign swing through the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> to try to seek to regain momentum lost to the Democrats during their convention. Democrats are expected to make a major effort to win back the region, beginning with heavy campaigning by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, while campaigning in <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was asked to comment on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s characterization during his weekly radio address of the Democratic convention message as `` midnight in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The Democratic candidate said he had no response, but said, `` We want to stress a positive message. ... That's the idea ... They know we're going to have a chance.'' In their second day of campaigning together, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> attended a rally of several thousand people in <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION> and then moved on to <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, N.D. Addressing a law enforcement group in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated his call for stricter enforcement of drug laws and for the death penalty for drug `` kingpins.'' `` We've heard a lot of tough talk about drugs from the liberals in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but when are we going to see some tough action?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked. `` We need more money for prisons and prosecutors. And we need tougher penalties for criminals.'' At an airport news conference in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the bump in the polls <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got from the Democratic convention had served to keep him in the position of underdog. But, he said, `` I like being behind ... I like fighting back. I remember <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to his loss to Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses The vice president was scheduled to campaign in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, on Sunday. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has all but used up the entire $ 27 million it is permitted in pre-convention spending. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has only been able to travel in recent days by coupling campaign events with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising events _ such as a luncheon he attended here and another dinner scheduled for <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. The funds are being raised for the national party for the fall election, with some of the money channeled back to pay for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s current travel However, this limits his ability to take long trips, and most of his recent campaign appearances have been confined to day trips, with returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> most evenings. This has had an inhibiting effect on campaign travel, particularly to distant states, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded in a conversation with reporters traveling with him on Air Force Two. `` It is troublesome,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Once Republicans hold their convention in August, his campaign will be infused with more than $ 43 million in public funds. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was briefed on the condition of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, 20 feet lower than its usual height at this time of year, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was told that the river is expected to rise by about six feet in the next week or so. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he joined with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> in opposing a plan to divert more Great Lakes water into the river, claiming it would not help that much and could cause environmental problems. He told a news conference that he would soon begin screening potential <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidates, possibly as soon as next week, with financial disclosure forms to be sent to those he will put on `` a long list.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said his campaign would conduct private polls to determine the vote-drawing appeal of various candidates. But, he said, he would not conduct interviews or do anything else that would be demeaning or elevate hopes of the people he would be considering. Claiming he wanted to announce his choice at the GOP convention, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` I will not leak my decision to anybody. But if I talk in my sleep and my wife finds out about it, I'm in for serious trouble.'' `` I've told <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> this is to be a real personal decision.'' Asked about the declaration of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> on Friday that he wanted to take himself out of consideration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` I really have n't had time to sort that one out.'' `` I have enormously high regard for ` our Duke,''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. He also went out of his way to praise to Tennesseans who are frequently mentioned as possible running mates _ former Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and former Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> _ but again, said he currently had no short list of favorites. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside a profile of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the Soviet Communist party newspaper Pravda, which appeared to suggest that the Democratic nominee was more intelligent than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I'm going to send -LRB- Soviet Leader -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a photostat copy of my Phi Beta Kappa key,'' quipped the 1948 <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> graduate.

 The condition of a 2-year-old Ukrainian girl whose mother believes her brain tumor was caused by the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident was upgraded from critical, a hospital spokeswoman said Saturday. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrievna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sverstiuk </PERSON>, who had a brain tumor removed at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, was listed in stable condition in the intensive care unit, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Phan </PERSON>. `` She's doing real well,'' <PERSON> Phan </PERSON> said. Neurosurgeons removed the core of <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>'s brain tumor during a nearly six-hour operation Friday and awaited test results to determine whether the growth is benign or malignant. <PERSON> Phan </PERSON> said the results are expected by Monday. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sverstiuk </PERSON>, has said she believes the walnut-sized tumor that was at the base of the child's brain stem resulted from the radiation of the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster, 50 miles from <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> five days after the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire that killed at least 31 people and released a cloud of radioactive material that eventually circled the globe.

 The chairman of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday denied reports that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has illegally imported heavy water for its nuclear plants, a news agency said. M.R. <PERSON> Srinivasan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has been producing heavy water since the 1960s, and it `` has been self-sufficient for her needs,'' the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` There is no question of importing illegally. In fact, at one stage we had exported to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>.'' He spoke at a news conference at <LOCATION> Poona </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>. Newspaper reports in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> have said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> may have received the water in shipments secretly diverted from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. Opposition party members in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have charged that some of the Norwegian heavy water was diverted with the help of a West German firm. The shipments allegedly were diverted in the early 1980s. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has not signed the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nonproliferation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>, and reports have suggested the heavy water could have been used to produce plutonium for making nuclear weapons. Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, looks like ordinary water but has an extra neutron.

<TEXT>
 One of the country's two Roman Catholic cardinals called Saturday for peace negotiations at the regional level to end the 19-year-old communist insurgency. Cardinal <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> of <PERSON> Cebu </PERSON> released a statement urging the government and rebels to `` sit down and face each other once more.'' He added `` this can not be done if others stand up and fight. A dialogue demands an atmosphere of sincerity and of course safety. Firing has to cease in the meantime.'' In proposing regional talks, the cardinal said: `` Such dialogues are better held within a locality. The more familiar the personalities involved, the better the issues are identified and easier settled.'' President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government reached a two-month cease-fire agreement with the rebels in December 1986 and tried to negotiate a political solution. But the talks broke down in January and fighting resumed after the end of the cease-fire period the following month. Attempts to revive the talks have failed. In the fighting, communist guerillas attacked a power station in a southern town and raided a hospital in the northern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, military and news reports said Saturday. They gave these accounts: About 40 rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> attacked the power station in the town of Tudela Thursday night with rifle fire, destroying four transformers and 45 voltage regulators. Another power station had been attacked Wednesday and the two assaults blacked out seven towns in <LOCATION> Misamis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Occidental </LOCATION> province. In northern <LOCATION> Cagayan </LOCATION> province some 100 rebels raided a hospital in the town of <LOCATION> Tuao </LOCATION> a week ago and fled with the medical supplies. No casualties were reported in the attacks. An estimated 3,000 members of anti-communist groups held a `` prayer rally'' Saturday in a downtown <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> park. The rally was organized by the `` <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, Return to God'' movement that said the action was to `` awaken the people to the evils and godlessness of communism.''

The Neutrality Act prohibits American citizens from trying to overthrow a nation `` at peace'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But attorneys for the defendants scoffed at the notion that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is at peace with the Sandinista regime in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The original federal inquiry that started about two years ago in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> helped expose the Iran-Contra affair, but the seven indicted this month were not major players in the underground Contra aid network. Attorneys for the defendants have said their clients were singled out to silence those in the network who had become critics of the administration, while those who gave the orders were not prosecuted. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> _ which is appealing a $ 24 million civil lawsuit relating to Contra aid efforts, alleged guns-for-drugs deals and other covert activities _ said the light punishment for <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was no big surprise. `` This conforms with our experience that one can violate the law to aid the Contras in the southern district of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> without fear of punishment,'' Christic spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dykstra </PERSON> said Saturday. `` We are upset but our anger lies more with the impunity that's apparently afforded to those in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who gave the orders to violate the law That's why we intend to bring our case back through the appeals process.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> pleaded guilty to the main charge of the indictment _ that the defendants conspired to overthrow a foreign government while on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> could have faced three years in prison. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said, `` I indicated to the judge that I thought the sentence was fair.'' Before appearing in <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON>'s court, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> pleaded innocent before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate Lurana Snow. He was released on $ 25,000 bond. Minutes later, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> changed his plea to guilty and he and his lawyers stood before Roettger for sentencing. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, is a marksman and professional weight lifter as well as a former bodyguard for <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a Contra leader. He has said that he fought with the Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to overthrow the country's leftist Sandinista government. `` I think certainly the judge sees this case for what it is, and I think he recognizes how inappropriate the charges are,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON>, an assistant federal public defender who has criticized the July 13 indictment for going after the `` foot soldiers rather than the generals.'' Five men named in the indictment have pleaded innocent. `` The sentence is absolutely phenomenal,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the lawyer for <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> businessman named in the indictment. `` I am sure that Mr. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and his attorneys are very pleased.'' One of the accused, mercenary-turned-whistle-blower <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>, is expected to plead on Monday. Others indicted were <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, brother of <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>; <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Coutin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Cuban and former Civilian Materiel Assistance liaison here; <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a Cuban-American stockbroker; and <PERSON> Maco </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a former assistant state attorney general and state representative in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 The secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, met Saturday with local defense officials as he wrapped up a two-day visit to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> that was conducted under extraordinarily tight security. An aide to <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said his visit was a general overseas tour to `` see the troops.'' It was <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s first trip to the area since becoming <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary this year, and it was not announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in advance. During the visit, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> boarded the flagship <PERSON> Coronado </PERSON>, the destroyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> and the mine sweeper Conquest _ three of the approximately 16 American warships now in the gulf. The security included a bulletproof car. All Americans in the region have been cautioned about possible terrorist acts in the aftermath of the July 3 downing of an Iranian jetliner by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. All 290 aboard the plane were killed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials meanwhile said they recovered a letter, bearing 10,000 signatures and expressing support for the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' captain and crew, that was supposed to have been delivered to the warship two days ago. The signature campaign was organized last weekend in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' home port, by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowrey </PERSON>, R-Calif. The letter, which reportedly weighs about 50 pounds and is 1,000 feet long, had been mishandled on its way to the gulf through an express delivery service, said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Lowrey </PERSON> aide. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, said the letter was found in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> cargo terminal Saturday and was shipped to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said the letter would be delivered to the ship Sunday. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> sailed out of the gulf three days ago and is in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, according to a spokesman at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Command headquarters in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Although there has been speculation that the 9,600-ton cruiser might be withdrawn from the region as a gesture toward reducing tensions, military sources, who asked not to be identified, said they had seen nothing to indicate the ship would leave before its scheduled departure in late August. Ball's visit had been planned before <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s announced acceptance last week of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire plan for ending the 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Ball, accompanied by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakhem </PERSON> and Rear Adm. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Less </PERSON>, commander of the Joint Task Force <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, met with <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s defense minister, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON>. In keeping with the strict security, officials refused to disclose the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary's destination after the gulf, other than to say it was `` not in this area.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is expected to reduce its naval force in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> if the cease-fire is implemented. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials here and at the Pentagon say it is too soon to speculate on a timetable for a cutback. Naval sources, asking not to be further identified, said that neither <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s visit nor the departure on Saturday of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships was related to any reduction in force. The destroyer <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> and the missile frigate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sides </PERSON> left the port of <LOCATION> Manama </LOCATION> and headed toward the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> toward home after completing their three-month duty tours. The sources said both will be replaced by other warships now en route.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> on Saturday accused <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> of provoking ethnic violence in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s southern province of <LOCATION> Sind </LOCATION>. `` We have fundamental proof, evidence to show to our friends in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, that they have been interferring in <LOCATION> Sind </LOCATION> by trying to isolate <PERSON> Sind </PERSON> from the rest of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said in a statement. He did not elaborate. More than 40 people have been killed in ethnic fighting in <LOCATION> Sind </LOCATION> during the past two months. In the latest incident, on July 17, the mayor of <LOCATION> Hyderabad </LOCATION> was wounded in an assassination attempt and a <LOCATION> Hyderabad </LOCATION> city councilman was killed in the attack. The shootings were followed by riots in which seven people were killed. Much of the violence has involved Moslem immigrants who fled to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> from predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> in 1947 after the Indian subcontinent received independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and was partitioned into <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The immigrants are demanding recognition as a fifth ethnic group. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is ethnically divided into four major groups: Pathans in the northwest, Punjabis in the eastern province of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, Baluchis in the western province of <LOCATION> Baluchistan </LOCATION> and Sindhis in <LOCATION> Sind </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> noted the immigrants have been in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> more than 40 years and said: `` Why is it that now they have come all of a sudden as a group demanding its rights? Because it has been provoked as such, as a parochial element in order to advance political reasons.'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> denied Indian allegations that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is adding to the violence in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> province. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is aiding militant Sikhs who are demanding an independent homeland in that province bordering <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION> is an offshoot of the Hindu religion. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is mainly Moslem and <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> in mid-June invoked Islamic law, saying it took precedence over existing legislation, and that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> must become an Islamic nation. He said Saturday, `` Anyone who considers that this is going to be a secular state, or a state in which you can have Islam as a religion between man and God only, is wrong.''

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took his campaign to the nation's agricultural heartland on Saturday, emphasizing his support for the farm family he called `` the backbone of this country.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> at his side, appeared before a huge crowd at the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> and promised that as president he would invest in rural development. `` If there's one thing I believe in it's the farm family because it's the backbone of this country ... and our economy,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The stop in <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, in a state with the fewest electoral votes, followed a morning rally in the central valley of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for an early strike in the biggest battleground for electoral votes. `` Here I am the son of immigrants, running with the grandson of immigrants,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the cheering crowd of more than 5,000 overflowing from a park amphitheater in <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` This was a trip I wanted very much to make right after <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. To come out here, to the heartland of the country.'' he said. `` To be in a valley which is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, because you are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, all of you.'' Even the music was designed to rouse local immigrant pride. As the candidates entered and departed, the loudspeakers blared singer <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>'s song, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' about immigrants coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and being proud of their new country, from the movie `` The Jazz Singer.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor accepted gifts from children representing local communities, including those from his own Greek background. Wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> put a Scottish cap on her husband, which he showed off and then waved to the crowd. Kept off to the side was a noisy group of several dozen anti-abortion protesters. In his speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> threw in Greek, Spanish and Portuguese phrases and got cheers from those groups. But his main pitch was to economic issues and to what he called `` progressive values'' of thrift and hard work, combined with help from the government including expanded health insurance programs. He promised to find new uses for agricultural products and to fight what he said was 12 percent unemployment in the <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION> area. The economic expansion of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was built on a `` fiscal house of cards'' standing on the huge federal debt that more than doubled during the past eight years, he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his weekly radio address on Saturday, said the Democrats `` do n't want to level'' with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, trying to hide their liberal politics. `` To hear them talk, you would never have guessed we are in the biggest peacetime expansion in history,'' he said. When the Democrats last controlled the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> did a heck of a lot worse.'' The Democratic candidates were in the second day of a three-day post convention swing across the country, with a strong middle-America theme. On Friday, they campaigned in <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Sunday's plans included events in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and Erie, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, before returning to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' native <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The rally was in the congressional district of Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the third-ranking Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, who said the ticket of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> could wrest from the Republicans two central valley voting groups which had strayed to the Republican side in presidential elections. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appealed to the families of ethnic immigrants. Running mate <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, himself from a <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION> farm family, appealed to those who moved to the rich agricultural valley from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and other states hit by the dust bowl of the 1930's, he said. `` If we can win the central <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION>, we can win the state,'' said <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with 47 electoral votes, has more than any other state. The Democrats have not won it since 1964. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, former chairman of the Democrats' national congressional campaign committee, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would probably neutralize the appeal of the Democratic ticket in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> if he chose Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> as his running mate.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accused Democrats Saturday of ignoring the accomplishments of his Republican administration and `` singing the same sad song they sang four years ago.'' `` To them, it's midnight in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his first comment on the Democratic National Convention that ended Thursday in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` To listen to the rhetoric, you would never guess the American economy is the strongest it has been in a decade,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> commented in his weekly radio address, delivered from his mountaintop ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> north of here. The president and first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday after a week-long vacation. While campaigning in <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked if he had any response to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks. `` No,'' he said. `` We want to stress a positive message. ... That's the idea. ... They know we're going to have a chance.'' Later, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> thinks the way to win an election is basically to tear the other guy down day after day, believe me -LRB- running mate -RRB- <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I can respond and will respond.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he dislikes `` ugly'' campaigns, `` but I also know from painful experience that if the other side essentially runs a negative campaign ... you have to respond and, believe me, Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I will respond. We're tough campaigners,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. In his radio address, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` When their party left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> eight years ago, inflation was at one of the highest levels in American history. Now, it's under control. Do they want to turn that around?'' Saying that his administration has improved American competitiveness in world markets and improved American-Soviet relations, he repeated, `` Do they want to turn that around, too?'' `` They said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can do better,'' the president said. `` with that, I wholeheartedly agree. But the people also know that the last time our opponents were in charge, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> did a heck of a lot worse.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said the Democrats are `` covering their tracks'' this year because they have found that the liberal policies they have pursued in the past are unpopular. `` You will never hear that ` l' word ` liberal' from them,'' he said. `` They've put on political trench coats and dark glasses and slipped their platform into a plain brown wrapper.'' `` While they are saying that government needs to do more of this or more of that, will they also pledge not to raise taxes?'' he asked. The president challenged the Democrats also to go forward with the missile defense system known as the strategic defense initiative or `` Star Wars,'' which he called `` the one practical way of reducing the threat'' of nuclear weapons. `` And while they are talking about the war on drugs, will they also support the death penalty for drug kingpins?'' he asked. Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, delivering the Democrats' response to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s address, said the party's convention enthusiasm was `` spreading like wildfire across the prairie. `` After eight years of a Republican administration fueled by selfish and sometimes unlawful motives, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are looking for a return to the basic values of common respect, compassion and concern for all,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said. He cited the plight of workers whose plants have been shut down and farmers who have lost their farms and said Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have been `` the safety net for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> opened his radio address by saying that `` this week there was a certain meeting in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and maybe, like me, you just could n't help hearing a few things about it and shaking your head.'' `` Some people just do n't seem to learn,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want to hear straight talk about where our leaders plan to take the country, not personal attacks.'' `` To hear them talk, you would never have guessed that we are in the longest peacetime economic expansion on record,'' the president said. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> have been at their <ORGANIZATION> Rancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cielo </ORGANIZATION> since Sunday, enjoying generally sunny and pleasant weather. The White House said their son, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Doria </PERSON>, had dinner with the president and his wife on Friday and spent the night at the ranch.

 A woman faces child abuse charges because of the ways she punished two sons and a nephew, including taping one boy's toes `` because he's always wriggling them,'' police said. Arraignment was scheduled for Monday on three felony counts of child abuse against <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Evanovich </PERSON>, 31, said Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Evanovich </PERSON>, described as a transient with no known address, said she bound the eyes of her 8-year-old nephew, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, with clear plastic medical tape `` because he kept looking around,'' said police Detective <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Livera </PERSON>. The woman said she taped <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>'s hands in back and put a plastic bag over them because the child `` was n't a good eater,'' and also put a lit cigarette in the boy's nose and mouth, Ms. <PERSON> Livera </PERSON> said. The mother said she taped together the hands of her son, <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON>, 7, as if he were praying and put a lamp shade on his head because he `` likes to stay up at night,'' Ms. <PERSON> Livera </PERSON> said. She also taped <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>' toes, Ms. <PERSON> Livera </PERSON> added, while the hands of her 4-year-old son, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, were taped to his side for other infractions.

<TEXT>
 Two youngsters pulled a prank on their mom Saturday but it backfired and no one laughed _ especially not authorities who believed an 8-year-old had been kidnapped. The older of the boys, age 12, told their mother his younger brother was `` picked up by somebody in a red car who took off,'' said Constable <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Roxbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The 12-year-old and his mother approached <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>'s patrol car and `` both of them were crying,'' the officer said. `` The mother was hysterical. All the kid told me was that ` a car pulled up and took my little brother.''' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> alerted the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Department and the state police in <LOCATION> Oneonta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Margaretville </LOCATION> on his radio, then headed toward <LOCATION> Margaretville </LOCATION> _ `` because he -LRB- the boy -RRB- said they went that way.'' The sheriff's department, in turn, notified the local radio station in this small town about 80 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. `` They wanted us to tell listeners to be on the lookout for a red car headed to the <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Margaretville </LOCATION> area from Grand Gorge,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the disc jockey at station <ORGANIZATION> WDLA </ORGANIZATION>. The station interrupted programming and broadcast the warning on its AM and FM frequencies at least seven times, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Meanwhile, authorities set up roadblocks and <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> returned to question the children's mother. It was then he learned it was all a joke devised by the children, intended only to scare their mother. The 8-year-old child had been `` in the woods near the home the whole time and he'd come back -LRB- home -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said. His 12-year-old brother was crying. `` The kid realized what he did,'' the constable said. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> refused to release the names of the children or their mother. `` In a way it was sad, but I was glad it wound up being like that'cause nobody really was hurt,'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said. Then he speculated about what would happen to the 12-year-old boy, saying, `` I think maybe his mother will warm his bottom.''

 The Roman Catholic patriarch of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> called on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities Saturday to `` renounce repressive measures'' in dealing with the Palestinian uprising. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, a Palestinian, told <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>: `` Violent measures used by the Israeli authorities, repressive measures, will never lead to calm and even less to peace, because violence encourages violence and an ever stronger resistance.'' `` What should be done is to try to understand the desires of these people calling for their rights, to talk with them and above all to treat them like human beings.'' The patriarch is the spiritual leader of the 65,000 Latin-rite Catholics in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the Israeli-occupied territories, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON> was the first <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> named to the post.

More than 230 Palestinians and four Israelis have died in the violence. `` What can the church do?'' <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON> asked. `` I do n't think the authorities listen, I do n't think many others will listen. I address myself to the Israeli leaders and call on them to renounce repressive measures.''

 Mexican lawmen stalking drug traffickers mistakenly shot and killed a news anchorwoman, her mother-in-law and a family friend Saturday, authorities said. Police officers mistook the journalist's car for one spotted near a clandestine airstrip where a plane believed to have been carrying Colombian cocaine had crashed, the official government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said federal Attorney General <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> ordered an investigation and the detention of the four police officers involved in the shootings. XHIJ-TV said its anchorwoman, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON>, 28, was killed along with <PERSON> Lucresia </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, 58, and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 25. Ms. <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, said he was in the car with the other three when they were shot about 3:30 a.m. near downtown Juarez, but he was uninjured. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, a co-anchor at the station, told reporters later Saturday that the four were driving near downtown when a car carrying four men tried to pull them over. He said the men identified themselves as <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> officers, but that he did n't stop because he was afraid they would rob him. He said he was carrying about $ 12,000 in cash raised by the TV station at a circus. When <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> did n't stop, the men started shooting the car with machine guns. About 40 to 45 bullet holes were found in the car, officials said. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said he was taken in for questioning and then released. State Judicial Police Commander <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivas </PERSON> said a car similar in description was found later abandoned with 40 kilograms of cocaine. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> cowardly killed my wife and my mother,'' <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said, his voice shaking. `` I hope the police do n't hide and protect these men.'' <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> identified the four police officers responsible for the shootings as <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON>, a federal judicial police officer, and city police officers <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jilguero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Librado </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> officials told the TV station in this border city across from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, that the gunmen were `` madrinas'' _ uncommissioned officers who often carry guns and act as surveillance agents. <ORGANIZATION> XHIJ </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said police told him the officers were trying to track a similar car that supposedly was laden with 80 kilograms of cocaine when the shootings occurred. `` They said it was a mistake,'' <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said. `` That's all they say. They thought that they -LRB- the victims -RRB- were narcotics traffickers because the car was the same type they were looking for.'' <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Armendariz </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, said the four people involved in the shooting were arrested, and added: `` These are embarrassing, lamentable deeds that we're not going to permit, and those responsible will be punished.'' <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said he did not think the fact that <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON> was a journalist had anything to do with the incident. He said Ms. <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON> had not been covering any stories on alleged malfeasance in government. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, shift commander at <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, told Juarez daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexicano </ORGANIZATION> that several men drove up to the hospital about 6 a.m., identified themselves as <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> agents, left the three bodies on the parking lot and drove away. In addition to anchoring news shows, Ms. <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON> had her own Saturday evening news program called `` Columnas Semanal,'' Weekly Column. She taped the last show at 6 p.m. Friday, and before Saturday's airing, a woman on the brink of tears appeared on the television and read a letter from the management of the station. `` It's lamentable that she lost her life by mistake,'' the unidentified woman read, her voice trembling. `` We hope the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> seek justice ... We _ all of us at <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> 44 _ feel much pain tonight.'' She said Ms. <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON> was three months pregnant.

<HEAD>Panda Ling-Ling May Be Pregnant Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ling-Ling </PERSON>, the nation's famed female giant panda, may be pregnant again, a zoo spokesman said Saturday. Laboratory tests show the same hormonal pattern that was observed when <PERSON> Ling-Ling </PERSON> was pregnant last year, said zoo spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. `` A lot of people are feeling positive, but no one will say for certainty that <PERSON> Ling-Ling </PERSON> is pregnant,'' he said. `` There are reservations.'' If she is pregnant, she probably would give birth during the last couple of days of July or the first week of August, he said. She has given birth to four cubs at the zoo, all of which have died. <PERSON> Ling-Ling </PERSON> and her panda partner, <LOCATION> Hsing-Hsing </LOCATION>, the star attractions at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, mated three consecutive days during the second week of April, he said. A sophisticated lab analysis of her urine shows the same pattern of hormonal changes as scientists observed last year when she was pregnant, which `` has led a lot of people around the zoo to believe the panda is pregnant,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. `` But the people familiar with the analysis are telling people that although the pattern is there, there is a lot of room for error because we have only one accurate predecessor of this year's results'' and a false pregnancy could produce the same results, he said However, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said, `` We're proceeding like she is pregnant. We've installed a sophisticated TV monitoring system and have around-the-clock volunteers'' watching for any signs of impending birth. `` We do n't want to do anything to upset the panda,'' he said. `` We want business as usual as much as possible.''

 A 600-pound boulder slipped off a mountain outcrop, crashed 1,400 feet down a steep incline and smashed into a house Saturday, killing a sleeping child, state police said. `` It was out of the blue, an act of God,'' said state police Sgt. C.E. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, Jr. The 3-foot-wide rock crashed through the outside wall of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcum </PERSON>'s house and went through a closet and another wall and into the bedroom of <PERSON> Marcum </PERSON>'s sleeping 15-month-old child, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said. The rock hit the infant, whose name was not released, and continued through two more walls and another bedroom before rolling to a standstill, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said. `` If it was another four or five feet to one side, it would have missed the house and just rolled onto <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 52,'' he said. The child's parents were at home at the time of the 4:15 p.m. accident. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said there was no mine blasting in the area and no indication of anything that would have triggered the rockfall. `` It just came off the top of the mountain,'' he said.

 Producers and striking scriptwriters resumed talks Saturday for the first time in more than a month, and both sides immediately agreed to a news blackout.

He asked for the news blackout at the start of Saturday's meeting at alliance headquarters in <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON>, spokesman for the 9,000-member guild. The news blackout extends for the duration of the resumed negotiating sessions, <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON> said. `` Something historic is happening upstairs.

But alliance spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the producers had nothing new to offer. `` All of the ingredients for a deal are on the table and they have been for several weeks,'' said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. `` We are going to sit and listen. That is our posture for this meeting.'' Previous talks ended in June with scriptwriters overwhelmingly rejecting an offer from producers. The strike began March 7 over the issue of payments for reruns of one-hour domestic shows and a bigger share in the increased foreign market.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday it has begun allowing AIDS patients to import treatment drugs that have not been approved for sale in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Speaking to a hostile crowd at a conference on gay and lesbian health issues, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> unexpectedly announced that the government last Wednesday officially began allowing the import of some unapproved treatments for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. `` All of us are dealing with a time line that is fierce,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> told a crowd of about 300 people who heckled him throughout his speech. Under the terms of the new policy, AIDS patients can import drugs from other countries if the product is purchased for personal use and not for sale, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> maintains the right to deny any drug shipments into the country. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> was moved to change its policy in part to control the shipment of AIDS treatments because some drugs have been imported illegally. He said some of the drugs have been shown to have applications to help combat the disease, which is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. Young defended the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s record, saying the agency had worked hard to gain approval for the drug AZT, which federal government scientists consider the most promising treatment developed to date to prolong the lives of those with the virus. He said federal money and personnel devoted to AIDS have increased dramatically. Despite the announcement, protesters charged the government with failing to do enough to permit the use of drugs to help treat AIDS victims. `` He announced the policy because he heard there were going to be protests and he wanted to placate us,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> of the New York-based AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. `` But we're not going to be placated with just dribs and drabs.'' The demonstrators, most of the crowd attending the speech at the 10th National Lesbian and Gay Health Conference and AIDS Forum, held aloft watches with alarms ringing to illustrate that people with AIDS can not wait while drugs are put through years of testing before use. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said several drug treatments for AIDS being used in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and elsewhere have been proven to be effective and should be legalized in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We've had other epidemics such as toxic-shock syndrome and Legionnaires' disease which have been addressed swiftly,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ACT-UP </ORGANIZATION>. `` But after eight years, the commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is still talking about hope and we only have one drug -LRB- AZT -RRB-, which is highly toxic.'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said he wanted the meeting at the conference to mark the beginning of an effort to `` build bridges'' between federal regulators and AIDS activists. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> shares your concern for the individuals who are suffering from this devastating disease and -LRB- is -RRB- painfully aware of their desperate efforts to seek treatment,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said over protesters' shouts, which often drowned out his speech. `` No higher priority exists for us than to work together to alleviate their suffering,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> shares your frustration on the lack of effective therapies available, but we also know that research is providing many new candidates, some of which will be successful.'' As of June 15, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> had approved 178 applications for testing of drugs and other therapies to treat AIDS, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. Later Saturday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Reps. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, two <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrats who are openly gay, were presented awards from both the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> for their work on behalf of the gay community and to combat AIDS. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> urged conferees to vote in the upcoming election. `` We have a country that is not informed about AIDS and what we can do about it. Part of it is due to a failure of political will and partly it is due to the failure of the executive branch,'' he said. `` We would have more money for health issues if it were n't for increased defense spending,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who received three standing ovations. <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's response to AIDS. `` This president seems to think the answer to this disease is monogamy and marriage,'' he said. Other speakers included <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, the openly lesbian daughter of actress <PERSON> Lana </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, and Broadway actress <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Stritch </PERSON>. About 1,500 homosexual men and women are attending the weeklong conference, which ends Tuesday. Homosexual or bisexual males account for 62 percent of the 68,220 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AIDS cases counted by the government since June 1981. There have been 38,541 deaths, or 56 percent of the total cases, the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported last week. AIDS is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Delhi's Death Toll From Cholera Rises To 118</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Workers with spades, wheelbarrows and trucks began removing heaps of garbage from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s slum areas Saturday as officials reported 14 more deaths from cholera and intestinal infections. The death toll from this month's outbreak is now at least 118, and a city health spokesman said Saturday hospitals had admitted 70 more patients with cholera and other intestinal diseases. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who visited the affected districts Friday, has given the municipal sanitation department a deadline of three days to clean clogged drains and garbage dumps and spray pesticides over stagnant water. He accused city administrators and health officers of not doing enough to combat the epidemic. The health department spokesman, who spoke with the condition he not be identified, said 103,684 people have been inoculated in the disease-stricken zones. Trucks were collecting garbage and crews cleared the overworked drainage system. The onset of the monsoon rains in early July resulted in clogged drains in districts with inadequate sanitation facilities. Health officials blame the cholera outbreak on the contamination of wells by rainwater flowing through garbage and sewage. More than 9,140 people have sought treatment at hospitals this month for cholera and gastroenteritis, according to official figures. That is more than four times the number of such cases registered in all of July last year. Outbreaks of cholera and gastroenteritis also have occurred in northern <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> states claiming 62 lives, according to news reports.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> on Friday criticized as unfair a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to impose economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for refusing to recognize patents for foreign pharmaceutical products. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> started a process Friday that will lead to sanctions on $ 200 million worth of yet unspecified Brazilian goods. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the No. 1 market for Brazilian exports. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> issued a communique calling the decision `` unfair and discriminatory.'' He said it `` violates the most elementary principles of international law and the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>,'' referring to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based body that promotes fair trade practices. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was caving in to the special interests of the American pharmaceutical industry and warned the action `` tends to undermine bilateral trade relations.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claims American drug companies lose about $ 36 million a year because <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> permits unauthorized copies of pharmaceutical products and formulas. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> denied that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies were being jeopardized. He said 85 percent of the Brazilian drug industry is foreign-owned and that American companies were the market leaders with a 35 percent share. He added that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> may demand reparations under <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> provisions for damages caused by the sanctions. The sale of medical drugs in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> totaled $ 1.1 billion in 1987, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. About 73 percent of that total was by foreign-owned multinationals. Of the 500 pharmaceutical companies in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, 69 are foreign-owned, the association said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision had been expected by the drug industry in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Raimundo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Anglo-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION>. `` Only the government did n't see it coming. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has not shown any willingness to negotiate,'' <PERSON> Raimundo </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Raimundo </PERSON>, who also is an executive of the Brazilian subsidiary of the British-owned <ORGANIZATION> Glaxo </ORGANIZATION> drug company, said the sanctions would immediately hurt Brazilian exports. `` It already is having an effect. The American importer and the Brazilian exporter do n't know what products will be on the list, so trade stalls,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> came close to slapping $ 105 million in trade sanctions on <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> earlier this year, but backed away in March when that country responded to complaints about its policies regarding importation of software products.

They argued that they were placed in an impossible position _ if they refused an order, they could be court-martialed and if convicted sent to prison; if they did not refuse, the public would lose confidence in the secrecy of discussions among judges. The appeals court on Friday ordered that one of its members, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a former member of judicial investigation commissions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, to serve as a special master, to supervise the investigation, ruling on all requests for interviews or documents from the inspector general. <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> also `` shall have full power and authority to receive, consider and independently investigate any allegations of judicial misconduct'' if he finds good cause to do so, making recommendations to the full appeals court on what he finds. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Carome </PERSON>, appointed by the appeals court to represent the reviewing judges, said that was `` an invitation to the inspector general'' to detail her evidence, if any, to Cox.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge listened to more than two hours of legal arguments Friday, then delayed ruling on a news media request to unseal documents in a major investigation of suspected fraud in military contracts. `` It seems to me there is just no way to properly render a decision from the bench,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> said. He said he had not received complete copies of the documents sought until Friday and wanted to study them before ruling and added: `` I'm not at all sure what decision will be rendered.'' The request pending in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is one of a number of similar efforts by news organizations to see affidavits related to the coast-to-coast probe of the relationship between defense industry consultants, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials and weapons manufacturers. Before leaving the bench, <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> asked government prosecutors how long they planned to keep the material sealed if he ruled in their favor. Prosecutors had asked <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> to overturn a decision by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON>, who ruled last week that the public has a right to see the documents now. `` I ca n't give you a date, but I hope it would be reasonably soon,'' responded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>. He said it would be released when the government no longer feared harm to its investigation. But attorney <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Heincke </PERSON>, representing the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, argued the government failed to show that any harm could come from documents in an investigation that is already in headlines. `` Anyone who is going to destroy evidence has done it by now,'' he said. Attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Copley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> sought release of the documents detailing searches at the offices of <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> home of consultant <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>. The most vehement opposition to unsealing the documents came from a battery of attorneys representing unnamed employees of companies mentioned as targets of the probe. They argued that the reputations of these clients, referred to as `` Mr. X,'' would be harmed by a mention in the documents, even if they are never charged with a crime. `` It would be totally destructive of these individuals to unseal the affidavits,'' said attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>. Among the newspapers seek release of similar documents are The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Post-Dispatch </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>, published in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> -RRB- Pioneer Press Dispatch; the Star Tribune of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>; and The <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> -RRB- Courant. In <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> on Friday, a federal magistrate took under advisement a request to see documents allowing a search of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiltz </PERSON>, lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cudd </ORGANIZATION> that keeping the search warrants and affidavits sealed is pointless because `` any reasonably informed observer'' could make a good guess as to what is involved in the investigation, simply by reading newspapers. But Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> told the magistrate the fact the information was printed in newspapers `` does n't make it accurate.'' On Thursday, The <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION> filed a motion seeking documents related to the search of <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> offices in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. Earlier in the week, the newspaper had asked a federal judge to unseal affidavits related to the search of three <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> offices of <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> and the home of a <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> vice president. Both <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> are divisions of Hartford-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s largest private employer.

 A Canadian provincial court in a landmark ruling on Friday rejected an <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> man's bid to prevent his former girlfriend from having an abortion. But Justice <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Viet </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Alberta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bench </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged the rights of a father of an unborn child by ruling that <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, 25, could sue 18-year-old <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandanburg </PERSON> for damages. Mock obtained a temporary injunction to prevent Ms. <PERSON> Brandanburg </PERSON> from proceeding with the abortion, but that injunction expired on Thursday. When it did, Ms. <PERSON> Brandanburg </PERSON>'s lawyer told reporters, her client went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and got an abortion. `` It's devastating,'' said <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, who had claimed father's rights and wanted to raise the child on his own. He said he would pursue the case for damages. `` I've come this far ... I've just lost my child and it's not going to die in vain.'' The decision came as <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> wrestled with the abortion issue following a controversial <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision last January, striking down <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s restrictive abortion law. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s Conservative government said debate will begin next week on compromise legislation that would permit easy access to abortions early in a pregnancy but impose restrictions in later stages. Anti-abortion and pro-choice groups had used the <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> case to back their arguments, and both sides claimed victory. `` Every step along the way in cases like this are important for women,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyck </PERSON>, who represented Ms. <PERSON> Brandanburg </PERSON> and argued that a woman should have control of her own body. Mock's lawyer, <PERSON> Rosanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Saccomani </PERSON>, said the judge acknowledged the merits of her client's case by saying he had the right to sue for damages. Ms. <PERSON> Saccomani </PERSON> told the court the couple lived together 18 months and had a verbal agreement as a common-law couple last February to stop using contraceptives so they could have a child. `` There was an intention to create a child ... that was what the parties wanted. She should continue with her obligations.'' She said the relationship broke up in June because of opposition from Ms. <PERSON> Brandanburg </PERSON>'s family. By then, Ms. <PERSON> Brandanburg </PERSON> was pregnant. Her lawyer argued that <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>'s request for a permanent injunction to prevent the abortion was `` ludicrous'' since he had no rights as the father of an unborn child.

 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> offered prayers and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> talked politics Friday as 1,000 Americans gathered in this land of fog and bog on a pilgrimage for peace in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` I hope to do nothing but be a pilgrim. I hope to do nothing but pray,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said at an airport ceremony, explaining why he would not delve into political specifics. The cardinal, the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he was visiting <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in `` a totally non-political, non-ambassadorial position. ... The only contact we want to make is with God.'' The allusion was to his lack of meetings over the issue of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, a self-described `` Jewish soldier in the cardinal's army,'' was less reticent He repeated his belief that the British should eventually leave <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and said the British should release a government report on police violence against nationalists in the province. The mayor said that by not releasing the report, compiled by veteran investigator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalker </PERSON>, the British government `` loses any credibility for the future ... and that means that there's even more bitterness.'' At <LOCATION> Knock </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> joined the pilgrims and embraced <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who kidded him, `` You're all over the papers'' _ a reference to a photograph of <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> pouring a pint of ale in a <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> pub. The pilgrims gathered at the Shrine of <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knock </LOCATION>, which commemorates the evening of Aug. 21, 1879, when 15 people said they saw a vision of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, mother of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. The apparition was a rare sign of hope in a region that had been devastated by famine and emigration. The shrine's success as a tourist destination was ensured when Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> visited it in 1979. Knock is still a village of less than 400 people, but now it boasts three hotels and as many policemen, more than a dozen pubs, and an airport with an 8,000-foot-long runway. Despite a turnout that was lower than expected _ the basilica in <LOCATION> Knock </LOCATION> was only half filled for his first Mass in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he was not concerned. `` Not only am I not disappointed, I am overjoyed by the number that did come,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. In a conclusion to his sermon, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said: `` This is the beginning of a series of pilgrimages that will captivate the world. ... All hearts, all minds will turn toward the sufferings in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.'' The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to push the British out of Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, join it with the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and set up an all-Ireland socialist state. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is outlawed on both sides of the border. Its legal political wing is <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Friday that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s alliance with the West blocks return of four disputed islands, a Japanese official said. The Soviet leader reiterated the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s long-standing position on the islands, under Soviet control since World War II. His stance allowed no progress on what <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> considers the main obstacle to improved relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the Japanese official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> occupied four islands off northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> at the end of World War II. The dispute over ownership of the territory has prevented the two nations from concluding a peace treaty for 43 years. <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> some of the area was occupied illegally by former dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> argued that, as part of the current Soviet drive to acknowledge and correct past wrongs committed by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, the territory should be returned to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the Japanese official said. In a 1956 joint declaration between the two nations, the Soviet government announced its willingness to return two of the islands upon conclusion of a peace treaty to officially note the end of World War II. However, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reminded <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> amended that position in 1960 `` because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> decided to conclude a new security arrangement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the official said, paraphrasing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He reported that despite the impasse on the issue, <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> was pleased with the visit that began here Wednesday. <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> was due to leave Monday and return directly to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We did n't find anything particularly new in the messages sent by the Soviet side,'' said the government official, who was present at the meeting between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>. `` But what was more interesting was the extent to which we were able to get our message across to the Soviet side.'' <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> left the office of prime minister late last year but has been considered during the Soviet visit as an envoy of his successor, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> officially considers <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s visit private, though he belongs to the Diet, or Parliament. The Japanese official contrasted what he described as a new Soviet receptiveness with conditions four years ago, when all mention of the disputed islands was censored from Japanese speeches carried by Soviet media. The official said <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> expressed mutual interest in improving relations between their countries but that no specific agreements were concluded during the visit.

 A heat wave and a drought that is ravaging much of central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is drying rivers, destroying crops and threatening the water supply of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s biggest city, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, newspapers reported Friday. The Liberation Daily -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Jiefang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ribao </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- said water consumption in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> has been near an all-time high since the beginning of July.

<HEAD>British Shipworkers Blow Stacks Over QE2's Foreign Repairs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 British union leaders fumed Friday as the famed luxury liner Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> was shipped back abroad to be made shipshape. `` This could have been avoided if the work had gone to a British shipyard in the first place,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferry </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>. The ocean liner, also known as the QE2, will get a new propeller system in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where it underwent a costly refitting last year. <ORGANIZATION> Cunard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steam-Ship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, the liner's owner, faced protests last year when it gave the $ 190 million refit contract to the <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Werft </ORGANIZATION> shipyard in <LOCATION> Bremerhaven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> The shipping firm said no British shipyard would accept the six-month deadline with penalties reported at $ 1.7 million a day. A <ORGANIZATION> Cunard </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Friday the work performed by <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Werft </PERSON>, primarily to install new diesel engines, had been excellent. However, he said problems arose involving a fuel-saving type of propeller installed at the company's request. He said the device had never been tried before on a passenger ship. The propeller will be replaced with a traditional type at a cost of $ 3.4 million, under a guarantee by <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Werft </PERSON>, the spokesman said. However, Ferry laid the problems to cost-cutting wars. `` Countries are undercutting each other because of the market, and this has led directly to work being done to time and price at the expense of good quality workmanship,'' he said. Passengers paying up to $ 5,950 for the first post-refit cruise raised a host of complaints, including flooding in cabins and bathrooms, sweltering rooms and faulty water taps, showers, telephones and television sets. Some of these problems were linked to vibration by the propeller shaft. The 19-year-old vessel was used as a troop ship during <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 1982 war with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> It was due back in its home port of <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> Aug. 1 to take passengers on a trans-Atlantic trip.

<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 8,000 people rallied Friday to support four Slovenians on trial for allegedly disclosing a military secret, the state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The meeting was organized in a park near <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>, the Slovenian capital, by an unofficial committee formed to defend journalists <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tasic </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franci </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavrl </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Borstner </PERSON>, a non-commissioned army officer. The four were charged by the military court in <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> with possessing a classified document allegedly dealing with the deployment of army units in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most developed republic. Protesters said the closed-door trial, which started Monday, was seen as an attempt to crack down on democratic tendencies in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. Several speakers, including intellectuals and war veterans, criticized the military and <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> federal authorities for wanting to `` usurp the sovereign rights of the Slovenian people,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Zavrl </PERSON>, the only defendent not in custody, also addressed the meeting, describing the trial a `` shameful, humiliating court proceeding,'' the report said. All three journalists have in the past sharply criticized the army and particularly former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamula </PERSON>, accusing him of promoting sales of <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> arms to Third World countries and of misappropriating public funds. Earlier Friday, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s presidency rejected an appeal by the Slovenian leadership that the trial be conducted in the Slovenian language instead of Serbo-Croatian. The republic's leadership has earlier demanded that the trial be conducted openly, that the accused be defended by civilian lawyers and that they be released from custody. The army rejected the requests, citing what they called the sensitive nature of the classified documents.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said Saturday the idea of a meeting with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to discuss how to bring peace to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is still under discussion. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> was replying to reports out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qizhen </PERSON> and his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON>, would meet in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in August to work out a peace settlement on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was informed of the planned meeting during a visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> a week ago. The Cambodian question has been taken up in recent sessions of Chinese-Soviet political normalization talks held twice a year, but the August meeting would be the first devoted solely to the subject. The Foreign Ministry called such a meeting `` still under consultation.'' It did not elaborate. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is the main obstacle to normalizing relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Relations have been strained since the two Communist giants split over ideological and strategic differences in the early 1960s. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which backs the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and other forces fighting Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, financial supporter for the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> government, must use its influence to end <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s nine-year occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The main factions in the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict _ the three-party resistance coalition, the Vietnam-backed <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> _ are scheduled to gather in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> next week to set an agenda for peace negotiations. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, battered by economic crisis and natural disasters at home, has pledged to withdraw 50,000 troops this year and remove its total force of about 120,000 by 1990. But prospects for peace are clouded by squabbling within the resistance coalition, the resignation of coalition leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and the future role of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 to 1978. Under <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule, hundreds of thousands of Cambodians were killed. Soviet and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> involvement is considered crucial if peace is to last in the Southeast Asian nation. A settlement to the Cambodian question would also set the stage for the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years. Chinese senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have expressed interest in a summit, but <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has stressed that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> must first remove what <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> calls the `` three obstacles,'' particularly the problem of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

 The weak dollar is not keeping hordes of Americans from traveling abroad this summer, but it has prompted many to seek cheaper destinations, travel consultants and tour operators report. Although some foreign countries are getting more American tourists than a year ago, overall foreign travel is running at about the same level as last summer, the travel professionals say. That was around 2.3 million Americans, up sharply from the 1.8 million in the summer of 1986, when the dollar's steep slide and terrorist incidents kept many at home. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> still accounts for about half of all vacation travel overseas by Americans, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> remain the most popular destinations, with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> the leader by far.

 In the dusty days of summer, when temperatures hover above 100 degrees for days on end, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> rejoices at the coming of the monsoon and its cooling rains. `` In the West, the rains are depressing. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> they are a time of great joy, release, beauty and romance,'' says <PERSON> Khushwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a noted author and journalist. As the rains come, the dust settles. Parched gardens suddenly turn green. Temperatures come soothingly down and so do tempers. But the monsoon has its sad side. The rains that started early in July ended two years of drought in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, promising good crops at last, but they also unleashed floods that three weeks later had left at least 370 people dead around the country of drowning or disease spread by contaminated water. The death toll in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> from contaminated water approached 100. A city official said more than 7,100 others had been treated in hospitals for cholera or gastroenteritis. For <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the downpour broke the stifling heat, but telephones went dead, potholes multiplied or grew deeper, and disease became a danger as tainted water seeped into pipes and wells. At the first delicious moment of the monsoon, though, the nourishing rain kept such troubles distant. `` The monsoon ... for most Indians ... is not only the source of life, but also their most exciting contact with nature,'' says author-journalist <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. When the clouds first burst open over <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, dozens of half-naked children danced gleefully in the downpour and splashed in puddles in one impoverished neighborhood along the <LOCATION> Yamuna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` It's always like this,'' said <PERSON> Gulab </PERSON>, an elderly woman watching the fun. `` The children love to play in the rain, but they invariably get sick.'' More than 5,300 people have been treated this year for gastro-enteritis and cholera in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. At least 75 have died, most of them children. <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON>, a university teacher who has lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> for many years, described <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s monsoon this way: `` There is muck and mud all over, mosquitoes attack you in hordes, diseases spread like vice. It's impossible to get to places on time, given the state of the roads, and calling people on the phone is such a nuisance _ half the phones are dead.'' Then, she added, there's the humidity. `` The moment the rain stops, you sweat to death.'' Even so, Ms. <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> went on, she ca n't imagine life without the monsoon. `` What could be more delightful than eating ` bhutta' -LRB- roasted corn-on-the-cob -RRB- on your terrace as the grey-purple skies melt into rain?'' One city official, who insisted on anonymity, said he could do no work during the monsoon. `` It's too beautiful just to relax, sit and watch the rain,'' he said, as he sat watching the rain stream down his office window.

 When they hear talk that corporate `` insiders'' are bullish on the stock market these days, many investors take the message skeptically. After all, this supposedly savvy group of chief executives, directors and major shareholders gave no warning whatsoever last year that the market was headed for a crash. Nevertheless, since that debacle insiders have been buying stocks of their companies at a furious pace. And the market has recovered some of the ground it lost last fall. `` The rally has now progressed for more than half a year,'' observed <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON>, editor of the investment advisory letter The Insiders, which defines its subjects as `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most knowledgeable investors.'' `` Throughout this recovery,'' <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON> adds, `` the insiders have correctly been flashing bright and clear signals that the market outlook was bullish.'' Insiders tend to acquire much of the stock they hold in their companies through private arrangements such as corporate incentive plans. Thus, their activity in the open market, which they must publicly report, is skewed toward sales rather than purchases. By <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON>'s `` insider indicator,'' the normal level of insiders' buying is 35 percent of their total open market transactions. A particularly bullish reading occurs whenever the percentage gets to 50 or more. Immediately after the crash, it surged above 90 percent, and at the end of 1987 it stood at 79. `` Since those on-the-money buy signals, the insider barometers have gradually eased'' to around 50 percent, <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON> says. `` But an objective reading shows that they now stand very close to the levels that signaled many a major market rally in the 1970s and early 1980s. The outlook today, in other words, is bullish.'' Most headlines about insider trading focus on stories of illegal buying or selling based on information that has n't yet been made public. The activity <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON> and other analysts track, however, is legal, and presumably reflects the special sensitivity insiders have to their companies' prospects. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Feigen </PERSON>, who publishes a newsletter known as The Insider Outlook, adds that insiders are forced to look beyond short-term market fluctuations. `` Insiders are the only group of investors who are required by law to be long-term investors,'' he says. `` Government regulations dictate that insiders must hold their purchases for at least six months before selling them for a profit. `` Because of this regulation, insiders can not take into consideration the current mood or direction of the market. Instead, when they buy they are focused on the ` special situations' at their companies. `` They expect to make substantial future capital gains _ more than they could get elsewhere and with more certainty. And they have an excellent track record for doing this successfully.'' If any outsiders want to base their investment strategies on what insiders are doing, <PERSON> Feigen </PERSON> suggests, they need to be prepared to be patient, for an indeterminate and sometimes very long time. `` Although you can be certain that the insider is investing in anticipation of a profitable return at some time in the future, you ca n't tell what timetable he has in mind for achieving his profits,'' <PERSON> Feigen </PERSON> says. `` There is no pattern that narrowly defines the length of time that all insiders follow when accumulating their stock. `` In many cases, the insider buying is concentrated within a relatively short time period _ a year or less. But other times it can go on for years.''

<HEAD>Bill Kirchenbauer Went From Class Clown to Standup Comic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With his name and a birthplace like <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, you might expect comedian <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirchenbauer </PERSON> to talk like <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON>. On request, <PERSON> Kirchenbauer </PERSON> does a pretty fair <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON>, but his otherwise unaccented speech reflects his peripatetic upbringing as an Army brat. `` I went to 13 schools in 12 years,'' he said. `` In just one year I went to four schools. I was always the new kid. I was also the class clown. They ca n't get mad at you if you're funny.'' <PERSON> Kirchenbauer </PERSON> is still funny, both as a standup comedian and as the star of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> comedy show `` Just the 10 of Us.'' The show, a spinoff of `` Growing Pains,'' made its debut in the spring and will return in the fall. He had originally auditioned for another role on `` Growing Pains,'' which he did n't get. But they liked him so much they offered him the role of Coach. He plays Coach <PERSON> Lubbock </PERSON>, who loses his job at <ORGANIZATION> Dewey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on `` Growing Pains'' and is forced to uproot his large family and take a new job at an all-boys prep school in a small town. He and his wife, played by <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, have five daughters, two sons, and one child on the way. `` Coach <PERSON> Lubbock </PERSON> was probably named after the city in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kirchenbauer </PERSON>. `` I lived there, too, when <PERSON> Dad </PERSON> was in the Army. I was born in <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>, then I lived just about everywhere, from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. I think that had a lot to do with my becoming a standup comedian. I moved so much I became the class clown to get along. I began to look at each class as an audience. I said if you squint it does look like an audience. `` My father was a sergeant-major, although he's now retired. The first place I can remember was <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benning </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. We lived on <LOCATION> Ingersol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loop </LOCATION> My mother called me <PERSON> Billiker </PERSON> <PERSON> Boop </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Ingersol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loop </LOCATION>. I've never been in the Army myself. I do n't take orders very well, except from a director.'' He said he had been an entertainer for as long as he could remember. `` When I was 5 I began working with puppets,'' he said. `` I always put on a show before Christmas. I had a <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> puppet my parents gave me. Then around 12 they started looking like dolls so I quit. `` In my teens I started doing impressions. I did shows at the American Legion and places like that. But doing impressions is very limited. All you can do is take people out of context. And so many people did impressions better than me. Then I began to do impressions of things. Like garbage trucks and typewriters and roller deodorant.'' He had a job selling video editing equipment, but about 10 years ago he quit and worked full-time as a comedian. <PERSON> Kirchenbauer </PERSON> had previously worked with <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thicke </PERSON> when he produced `` Fernwood 2-Night'' and `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> 2-Night.'' <PERSON> Kirchenbauer </PERSON> played egotistical singer <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Roletti </PERSON>. He said he sees Coach as a man who's idealistic about the way he raises his family. `` He just wants the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream for them,'' he said. `` My wife says he's like me: a bossy know-it-all, but a sweet kind of guy who would return a wallet if he found it.'' <PERSON> Kirchenbauer </PERSON> said the thing he likes most about the show is that he does n't have to travel as much. `` I enjoy doing the standup, but the travel gets you down,'' he said. `` Some people get rowdy in the clubs. I had to knock out a guy in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. I was using a big flashlight in my act and I hit him over the head with it. People think it's a game. You yell at the comedian and he yells back at you.'' <PERSON> Kirchenbauer </PERSON> has been appearing on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Tonight Show'' for eight years. The first time he was asked to be on the show he turned it down. He'd won a competition in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> for standup comics and he got the call after his picture ran in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. His manager told him he should n't go on `` The Tonight Show'' on a gimmick. `` I played the coach for six weeks on ` Just the 10 of Us' and now people think that's all I can do,'' he said. `` I've been doing comedy for more than 10 years.''

 Unfortunately for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's competitors, regulators are beginning to loosen their grip on the phone giant.

 Wall Street traders and brokers have been treated lately to a smorgasbord of just about everything that can go wrong in the investment game. Bond traders have been pinched by an erratic rise in interest rates. Fanciers of high-technology stocks have seen their holdings take a drubbing. Sluggish activity has left a big hole in brokers' commission income. And even the bears who thrive on weak markets got stung by selling short American depositary shares of Japanese stocks that they thought were poised for a fall, but went the other way instead. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, publisher of the Professional Tape Reader investment advisory service, summarized it as `` a neutral trading range market that has a serious case of the ` blahs.''' Heading into July, many stock analysts were counting on earnings reports for the second quarter to give the market a lift. True to expectations, results achieved by many companies for the April-June period have been impressive. Case in point: <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> profits, up 54 percent from the comparable period last year. But the market chose to concentrate its attention on disappointing earnings at a succession of high-technology companies like <ORGANIZATION> Seagate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tandem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computers </ORGANIZATION> and Data General. And rather than just dumping the shares of the company announcing the discouraging news, investors have responded each time by selling stocks throughout the high-tech sector. The state of the overall stock market, meanwhile, received eloquent testimony from the second-quarter reports of brokerage firms themselves. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, operator of the nation's largest discount brokerage firm and thus considered a good gauge of activity by individual investors, said its volume of business was off 42 percent from the second quarter last year. <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>, a full-service firm that handles a lot of trading for the public, said its commission revenues fell 32 percent. It barely cleared a profit for the quarter. With all that to set the tone, the stock market took its sharpest drop in more than three months this past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 68.46 to 2,060.99, for its biggest decline since it tumbled 76.26 points the week of April 11-15. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index dropped 4.10 to 149.55; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market lost 7.24 to 387.35; and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was down 3.20 at 306.11. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 150.13 million shares a day, against 175.20 million the week before. Normally in declining markets, at least the bears get a chance to feast by reaping profits on short sales. This time-honored strategy calls for borrowing stock from a broker, selling it, and then buying it back later at a lower price for return to the broker. The difference, minus commissions, goes into the short-seller's pocket. But it has n't worked out that way lately for one recent favorite target of short-sellers, the Japanese stocks traded in this country in the form of American depositary receipts. Many of these familiar names, such as <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, rebounded from the 1987 crash this year to new highs. Lately, they have been much discussed on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> as a way to `` play'' a break in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market, which by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standards has returned to very inflated levels. However, it looks now as though the shorts were caught in a squeeze when the stocks failed to decline and they scrambled to buy stock to cut their losses. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, which closed the previous Friday at 141, soared as high as 179 by Thursday. Somewhere on Wall Street, there is presumably someone who safely traversed this minefield by owning the Japanese stocks and shorting the technology issues. But otherwise, few have happy tales to tell right now.

<HEAD>Banks Weathering Drought Well</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Major farm-lending banks are weathering the drought of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and South remarkably well. The big debt-rating services say the protracted drought conditions that have dried up the profits of some farmers have left virtually no wrinkles on the quality of these banks' credit. The reason: Savvy bankers left nothing to chance following the farm crisis of the early 1980s. Most already had reduced their exposure to agriculture loans by paring down their portfolios and increasing reserves to cover possible losses, noted recent studies by <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The previous farm crisis also weeded out inefficient and highly indebted operations, while those that remained emerged stronger, more disciplined, with the help of farm insurance and government intervention, including price supports and disaster relief, the reports said. `` If anyone is feeling any pain it's likely to be smaller, unrated institutions,'' which normally do n't rely on the credit markets for additional capital, said <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s analyst and co-author of its drought-bank report. Both S & amp; P and <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s recently reaffirmed the credit ratings of bank holding companies with the largest exposures to agriculture loans, since the possibility of a drought or other problems already had been factored into their ratings. But they warned that if the same hot, dry weather conditions persisted next year, credit quality could suffer. A good credit rating translates into cheaper borrowing costs in the public sector. `` Their -LRB- banks' -RRB- access to the credit market helps them on an ongoing basis to expand in a diversified and less expensive manner,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroker </PERSON>, co-author of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's report. These days, credit raters are more concerned with broader problems facing banks, such as their exposure to loans to less developed countries and for real estate, Ms. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said. Banks with over 50 percent of their equity tied up in farm loans are most vulnerable, although only a handful of institutions fall into that category, according to S & amp; <ORGANIZATION> P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amarillo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, whose senior debt has been rated non-investment grade, had the biggest exposure in relationship to its size, with its $ 167 million in agriculture loans representing a whopping 871 percent of its equity, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P said. The banks with the largest overall farm-loan exposure, according to S & amp; P, were the large Western banks: <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has about $ 950 million in agriculture loans; <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 850 million; <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 630 million; and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION>, $ 596 million. <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, with $ 440 million in loans, is the largest agriculture lender in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. All of these big banks' loans are manageable because they represent under a third of their equity base, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P said.

<HEAD>Orange Juice Squeeze Coming To An End</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: An ADD containing weekly commodity price trends will follow
later in the cycle.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The orange juice supply squeeze that has raised retail prices and propelled futures prices to record highs should ease next month as shipments of frozen concentrate from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> resume, experts say. But consumers may not see a drop in retail prices of frozen concentrate until next year, after the new <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> orange crop has been harvested and processed. `` Once we get into the end of the year you get concerns about <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> freezes, so it might be a while before consumers begin to see orange juice prices fall,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON>, orange juice market analyst for the New York-based investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We're not looking for a substantial break to occur until the end of the winter,'' she said. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports of frozen Brazilian juice have declined steadily as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s citrus groves have recovered from a string of freezes in the early 1980s, imports from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> still account for about 40 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption, Ms. <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> says it exported the frozen equivalent of about 77 million gallons of orange juice to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from last July through this past May, about 40 percent less than in the same period a year ago. The declining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on Brazilian imports has been offset to some degree by rising Brazilian exports to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> virtually sold out of orange juice during its latest July-June marketing year. The new <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> orange crop wo n't be ready for processing until late fall or early winter. So <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> orange juice packers, caught between two harvests, were forced to dig deeper into their frozen stocks and raise their prices. Processing of the rapidly maturing new Brazilian crop will begin in two weeks or so, and shipments to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should resume before the end of August, analysts said. The resumption of imports should bring down prices for future delivery of frozen concentrated orange juice, which rose to a record $ 2.04 a pound July 18 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Orange juice for September delivery settled Friday at about $ 1.88 a pound. Wholesale orange juice prices generally lag behind futures prices by two or three months, Ms. <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON> said. So retailers, who are now paying about $ 1.65 a pound for frozen concentrated orange juice compared with about $ 1.30 a pound a year ago, may see even higher prices this fall. Consumers may not see significantly lower prices until next year, but competition among producers and retailers may keep a lid on prices at the retail level, she said.

Here is what happened in a rapid-fire week for the long-distance business: _ <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> blamed spiraling expenses for a 0.3 percent decrease in its second-quarter profits and announced a companywide hiring freeze, the first since the 1984 breakup of the Bell System It said it was moving 3,000 managers into sales and marketing. _ <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> reported a surprising nine-fold quarterly profit increase, setting records for both profit and revenue, less than a week after revealing it would buy back the 16.2 percent stake held by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> lost another $ 112 million before taxes in the latest quarter, its parents <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it would reduce its stake to 19.9 percent early next year, leaving the rest in the hands of the smaller <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` You put these events together and you really have a snapshot of the long-distance industry,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnum </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> had 72 percent of the long-distance market last year, followed by <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> with 9.3 percent and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> with 5.6 percent, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a Boston-based consulting firm From here, the battle of the long-distance carriers is expected to focus on big corporate accounts _ traditionally a stronghold for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, but an area where the newcomers can build a track record that carries over to other businesses, analysts said. The biggest question at week's end was <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint. If the company fulfills its promises of profitability, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> will look foolish for having backed out and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> will have the look of genius. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON>, its new 48-year-old chief, is coming to work at 6 a.m. and staying into the evening. Analysts call him intelligent and committed to the goal of turning <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint around. On the other hand, analysts say some corporate customers are reluctant to use <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint for other than secondary service because of questions about whether it can blot its red ink. Losses total $ 1.76 billion since the company was formed on July 1, 1986. Investors seemed willing to give <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> the benefit of the doubt. The stock ended the week at $ 33.25 a share, scarcely below the $ 33.62 -LCB- that prevailed before it announced plans to pay <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> about $ 600 million for 30.1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> has lately lost some of the big jobs that it once routinely won, a sign that it is losing its aura of invincibility among major customers. Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> has nailed down contracts from <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> has gotten work from the state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> SmithKline </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s drive to hold costs down while putting more salespeople on the road seems to be at least partly a response to concerns about long distance _ even though long distance remains highly profitable for the company, covering losses in the computer business. One analyst compared <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION>: loaded with talent, but possibly lacking in desire. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>, in contrast, is looking hot lately after hundreds of millions of dollars in losses in 1986. Its stock has doubled in the past year; its founder, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON>, is back on the job after a heart transplant last year; its recent earnings report reflects inroads into corporate accounts as well as 800 service and worldwide direct dialing, all <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T strongholds. <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sprint </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, has some obvious advantages, including a high-quality, nationwide fiber network that will eventually cost roughly $ 3 billion, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, an analyst with Link Resources in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Its problems include two years of billing snafus, which it is only now getting under control. Also, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint lacks some of the expertise in assembling networks that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> has and <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> is quickly gaining. <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint is trying to prove its mettle in that area by taking more advantage of the expertise at <ORGANIZATION> Telenet </ORGANIZATION>, a unit that is the nation's biggest network for data transmission. <ORGANIZATION> Telenet </ORGANIZATION>, about the only profitable part of <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>, has pretty much gone its own way for the past two years, a situation that <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s new chief vows to change. `` I do n't think we've done as good a job as we ought to there,'' said <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON>, who is chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION>, and took on the added role of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> chief executive when <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Snedaker </PERSON> abruptly retired this past week. <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON> predicted <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> would be profitable `` in the not-too-distant future.'' But after steadily pushing back its timetable for profitability, he has stopped naming dates.

 Energy futures prices were little changed after falling in early trading and then recovering on technical factors. The September contract for the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, fell 1 cent to $ 16.38 a 42-gallon barrel Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, the contract rose 34 cents. Among refined products traded on the exchange, the contract for August delivery of unleaded gasoline slipped 0.03 cent to 52.07 cents a gallon, while August home heating oil fell 0.58 cent to 44.95 cents a gallon. `` It was a mixed-bag session,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Azarow </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Early trading was dominated by events in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Azarow </PERSON> said. Traders became pessimistic about the impact the proposed cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> could have on already abundant world oil supplies, <PERSON> Azarow </PERSON> said. Both countries could step up oil production, adding to the glut, as they try to repair their economies following the war, he said. Traders were thinking, `` Maybe the outbreak of peace is not that good for prices after all,'' <PERSON> Azarow </PERSON> said. Contracts then fell to their lows _ with the September <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate contract sinking to $ 16.12 _ after reports of an Iraqi attack on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Azarow </PERSON> said. But when prices did not fall further, the session turned around on technical factors, <PERSON> Azarow </PERSON> said. `` New buyers felt confident because the market showed some support,'' he said.

<HEAD>Consumer Prices Up 0.3 Percent in June; Wall Street Finishes Down
Week</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The stock market failed to shake its recent slump despite an encouraging government report that consumer prices rose a modest 0.3 percent in June. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 25.60 points Friday to 2,060.99, stretching its loss for the week to 68.46 points. That marked the biggest weekly decline for the closely watched average since it dropped 76.26 points April 11-15. Despite the favorable consumer price report and a modest decline in interest rates, investors still showed little enthusiasm for stocks, analysts said. In another dose of good economic news, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said a surge in quarterly income tax payments by companies and individuals gave the federal government a rare $ 9.5 billion surplus in June. That left the cumulative red ink for the first nine months of the fiscal year below last year's levels. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, uncertainty about the weather outlook for the weekend and beyond in the drought-parched Farm Belt pushed most crop futures prices lower. Soybean prices for near-term delivery fell for the fifth straight day, bringing the August contract to just over $ 8.30 a bushel, the lowest price for near-month delivery since June 2. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report said the 0.3 percent June rise in consumer prices worked out to a moderate annual rate of 4.2 percent, with the effects of the drought showing up clearly only in poultry and egg prices. Food price rises held to a 0.6 percent gain despite the biggest surge in poultry and egg prices since August 1986, when the nation was in the midst of another drought. Offsetting increases on grocery shelves were a 0.2 percent decline in energy prices and a 0.3 percent drop in clothing costs. `` I'd say the report is good news. It clearly shows that inflation is not getting out of hand. It has accelerated over the last year or so, but very gradually and very unevenly,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm.
