<HEAD>Police: Palestinian Killed Jewish Teen Who Dreamed Of Co-Existence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> teen-ager who dreamed of Jewish-Arab co-existence and befriended many Arabs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was slain by a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> acquaintance after she refused to get him a gun, police said Wednesday. The Palestinian, whose name was not released, confessed to the slaying of 18-year-old <PERSON> Ziva </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldovsky </PERSON> and reconstructed the crime for police, said investigator <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisskoop </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Goldovsky </PERSON>'s charred remains were found Aug. 15 in a field near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weisskoop </PERSON> said her assailant choked her from behind and struck her repeatedly with a large stone before he and an accomplice set the corpse on fire. Ms. <PERSON> Goldovsky </PERSON> became the fifth Israeli to die in the 9-month-old Palestinian uprising. The Palestinian death toll has reached 259. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio described Ms. <PERSON> Goldovsky </PERSON>, an immigrant from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as an activist in the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Mapam </ORGANIZATION> party `` who could be found at most pro-Palestinian demonstrations.'' Ms. <PERSON> Goldovsky </PERSON>, a resident of the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of Holon, was engaged to a Palestinian from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, friends of the victim told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last month. Ms. <PERSON> Goldovsky </PERSON>'s fiance, who has a police record, is in custody on robbery charges but is not a suspect in the slaying, police said. On Aug. 13, Ms. <PERSON> Goldovsky </PERSON> and a Palestinian acquaintance went for a walk near <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION> and began to argue, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. The man started hitting her and shouted: `` Why do you dress so immodestly?'' the report said. `` Do n't hit me,'' she said. `` Even my parents do n't beat me.'' The man then accused her of being an informer for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> security service. When she denied this, he said: `` Prove it, get me a pistol.'' She refused, saying: `` I should get you a gun so you can kill young Jewish boys and girls?'' The man again slapped Ms. <PERSON> Goldovsky </PERSON> and then choked her. `` He took us to the place where he killed her,'' <PERSON> Weisskoop </PERSON> was quoted as telling the radio. `` He approached her from behind, choked her and laid her on the ground. `` Then he hit her with a large stone. About 50 yards from the site of the killing he and a friend burned the body and this is how she was found.'' One of Ms. <PERSON> Goldovsky </PERSON>'s Jewish friends, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last month she often hitchhiked to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and formed friendships with many Palestinians. The friend said Ms. <PERSON> Goldovsky </PERSON> dreamed of Jewish-Arab co-existence. `` <PERSON> Ziva </PERSON> would have continued her road of co-existence even if she knew what her end would be,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said on Thursday that it has appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to `` act immediately to stop the massacre of Kurdish civilians by Iraqi forces.'' Meanwhile, the leader of the Kurdish rebels said that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government troops are still attacking guerrillas and civilians in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> despite the government's amnesty offer. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights organization, said in a statement that it made its first direct appeal on Wednesday night to the 15-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> body in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> because the `` systematic and deliberate'' killings `` call out for immediate action by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.'' The statement charged <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wants to punish the Kurds for their political sympathies and in retaliation for opposition Kurdish activities. More than 100,000 Iraqi Kurds fled across the border to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and many of them gave consistent accounts of the use of chemical weapons, the statement said. Amnesty last week accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of killing hundreds of Kurdish villagers with chemical weapons in mountainous northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and of employing helicopter gunships, tanks and artillery in <LOCATION> Duhok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arbil </LOCATION> provinces. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadiq </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Mashat </PERSON>, denied chemical weapons were used. He was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Tuesday and was told of British concern over the large numbers of Kurdish refugees and the reports of chemical weapons use. The latest <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> statement gave a qualified welcome to the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> amnesty for Kurds, saying it received reports in the past of Kurds being imprisoned and executed after responding to previous amnesties. <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telex sent to The Associated Press office in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> on Wednesday that the Kurds will not accept the general amnesty offered by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> the day before. `` The Kurds have not struggled to be pardoned but to acheive their national and democratic rights within autonomy,'' <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON> said. `` Our struggle will continue until these goals are fulfilled.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> launched the offensive against the Kurdish rebels after a cease-fire in its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> went into effect Aug. 20. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Kurds have been struggling on and off for 50 years for an autonomous homeland. The <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has said that nearly 2,000 civilians have been killed and another 5,000 injured, many by chemical weapons. In his statement Wednesday, <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON> said the amnesty offer was an attempt by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to deflect attention from its use of chemical weapons.

<TEXT>
 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stunned an American Legion convention Wednesday by mistakenly saying Sept. 7 marked the anniversary of the attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> that led <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> into World War II. The gaffe _ which he corrected after prompting from the audience _ overshadowed a campaign day in which the vice president also stumped for Jewish votes at a B'nai B'rith convention in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, Md. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he opposes creation of an independent Palestinian state in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but also cautioned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> against annexation of the occupied territories or exercising permanent control by military occupation. In another matter signaling a departure from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> newspapers Wednesday he will soon outline a proposal calling for `` some adjustment'' in the minimum wage. The administration opposes raising the minimum wage, which is now $ 3.35 an hour. But campaign sources told <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expected to link a raise in the minimum wage to a sub-minimum wage `` training differential'' for teen-agers and other new hires. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has opposed such a differential in the past. `` We ought to maintain a minimum wage differential for training people,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been criticized by his opponents as insensitive to the needs of working people. The vice president received encouraging news from the latest <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll which found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by an eight-point margin. The survey of 1,104 likely voters found that 51 percent favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> while 43 percent prefer <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The poll, conducted Aug. 31 to Sept. 6, had a margin of error of 3.5 percent. On the question of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sharply criticized Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, although he did n't mention him by name. `` Anyone who has trouble making up his mind on this issue, or who proposes to leave it open, just does n't understand the dangers to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; just does n't understand the very real threats that continue to exist,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opened the day in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> with a speech before about 6,000 veterans at their 70th annual meeting. Departing from his prepared remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I wonder how many Americans remember today is Pearl Harbor Day. Forty-seven years ago to this very day we were hit and hit hard at <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and we were not ready. `` In a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration that lesson would not be forgotten,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> flyer decorated for combat missions during the war. `` It would guide my defense and foreign policy.'' The words were barely out of his mouth before the crowd turned uneasy. A buzz of mumurs rose among the audience as legionnaires began whispering about it. `` I thought nobody would forget that date,'' one veteran commented to another. A minute after his mistake, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped dead in his speech, alerted by the stir in the audience and people waving at him over his error. `` Did I say Sept. 7th? Sorry about that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, adding quickly that the correct date of the attack was Dec. 7, 1941. The audience applauded his correction and generally gave him a warm, polite reception. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters later, `` I just got messed up. I wanted to work <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in and just got carried away.'' It was the second rocky day in a row for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign, following a booing, jeering reception from shipyard workers in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, said the vice president had ad libbed his <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> remark, perhaps because it was 44 years ago this week that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a decorated <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> flyer in the war, was shot down on over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The gaffe marred <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attempt to highlight differences with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of trying to `` cancel and delay our strategic modernization with what amounts to an undeclared unilateral freeze.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes the MX and Midgetman missiles, the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> and has called for cancellation of two aircraft carrier task forces. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has opposed the Stealth bomber in the past `` although this may be changing.'' `` Let me be clear,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I do not question his patriotism. But patriotism is not the issue. The issue is how best to deter war, to keep the peace, to fulfill our country's special responsibility as leader of the free world.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> wants tough, tested, experienced leadership ... I am proud of having served my country in combat. I believe I have the fiber and the experience to lead this country.'' Later, in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> underscored the closeness of U.S.-Israeli relations. `` No threat, no stone thrown, is strong enough to divide us. No wedge will be driven between us,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged. In warning against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> annexation of the occupied territories, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` There has got to be another way, and that's what the peace process is all about.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he opposes creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state on grounds it would be a threat to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as well as to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, which he said is crucial to any lasting peace settlement. Moreover, he said, `` it would be contrary to American interests.'' On the flight from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that anti-abortion protestors who disrupted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speech Tuesday in a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb `` in my view went too far.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who opposes abortion in most instances, said, `` I would ask any supporter of mine to resist carrying their right to demonstrate to an extreme.'' Explaining his gaffe, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> explained: `` I just got messed up. I wanted to work <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in and just got carried away, and then I looked up and saw incredulity on the face of one particular guy down to my left and I thought, ` Whoops ... My Heavens! I've done it!' So I was glad to correct it.''

<HEAD>Calif. County Moves To Save Fairy Shrimp's Skunk Hollow Swimming
Hole</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MURRIETA HOT SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tiny Riverside fairy shrimps can keep splashing around in their swimming hole thanks to county supervisors who ordered developers to help save the recently discovered fresh-water crustacean. Developers planned to bulldoze a low-lying pond and build more than 2,500 homes, unaware that the species, whose ancestors date back millions of years, occupied the seasonal pool. <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> supervisors on Tuesday ordered <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tolman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> to preserve the threatened habitat after they were alerted by biologists who discovered the fairy shrimp species two years ago. The 22-legged fairy shrimp is about as wide as a pencil and 1 -LCB- inches long. It has been described by biologists as the most primitive crustacean living in fresh water. A group of biologists named the species the Riverside fairy shrimp after finding them in 15-acre Skunk Hollow pond and five smaller ponds in southern <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 80 miles southeast of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The fairy shrimp population survives dry summer months by burying eggs in the clay soil of the seasonal pools. The eggs of some desert species have been known to survive for as long as 25 years between adequate rains. The Board of Supervisors gave the developer and the biologists until Sept. 27 to come up with a proposal that would permit the survival of the fairy shrimp and <PERSON> Tolman </PERSON>'s proposed 2,571-unit housing project.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> parlayed $ 500 and frugality into a quarter-million-dollar estate, but after eight decades of tending his finances' growth, his harvest is heartache. At age 103, his yield is unhappiness. A family feud has grown up over who should handle his money and how his estate should be divided. As a result, the courts have declared him incompetent and placed him and his personal wealth under guardianships. Advocates for the elderly say proposed reforms in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s guardianship law might have spared him anguish and indignities in old age, including three medical examinations and the loss of many of his rights On the one side are <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> and his two sons, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 60, and <PERSON> William </PERSON>, 54. On the other side are his two daughters, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> McAleer </PERSON>, 62, and <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaborn </PERSON>, 50, who successfully petitioned a judge to declare him incompetent and to appoint guardians to make his personal and financial decisions. It was in the midst of the incompetency hearings in April that <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON>'s wife of 63 years, <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON>, died at age 89, and his mourning for her mixes with bitterness toward his daughters, with whom he no longer speaks. `` Both daughters wanted to take everything over that I worked all my life for,'' <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> contends, even though an audit found no impropriety when Mrs. <PERSON> McAleer </PERSON> was handling his day-to-day finances. `` I ca n't even spend my money after saving it,'' complains <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON>, who started work at age 15 for a dollar-and-a-half a week. `` When you think you got money, you ai n't got nothin'.'' He never earned more than $ 4,200 a year in 57 years of work as a machinist and maintenance engineer. He retired at age 72. He started saving when he was 29 by putting $ 500 from his share of the family house, sold upon his father's death, into five banks. Shopping for bargains and rarely traveling, <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> saved and saved. His will provided that each of his children would receive one-fourth of the accumulated wealth. After he and his wife entered a nursing home, he asked his elder daughter in late 1986 to help with his bill-paying and other accounts and gave her legal authority under a power of attorney. Still, he continued to monitor his finances, and at one point their figures conflicted. Father accused daughter of being unable to explain how $ 20,000 was spent. Last October, <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> transferred his power of attorney to his sons. He also changed his will to make the sons executors instead of the daughters. `` I cried the whole day,'' Mrs. <PERSON> McAleer </PERSON> testified. `` My heart was broken that my father would do this to me without telling me.'' Mrs. <PERSON> McAleer </PERSON> and her sister filed the incompetency petition 2 -LCB- weeks later, and an Orphans Court judge declared <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> incompetent on June 1, naming the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> as his financial guardian and a lawyer as his personal guardian. The incompetency petition upset <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> so much that he rewrote his will in March. Now, the daughters are to receive 10 percent each, the sons 40 percent each. The daughters declined to be interviewed, but their lawyer, <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wozman </PERSON>, said they apparently `` wanted protection'' after Mrs. <PERSON> McAleer </PERSON> was accused. `` I do n't think they particularly thought the sons were going to take his money. They did n't think the sons were the proper people to take care of it. They did n't think they were either. No matter who controls the money, someone is going to complain they're not doing something right,'' <PERSON> Wozman </PERSON> said. Explaining why the guardianship was sought, the lawyer said the old man was not `` rational in terms of financial affairs.'' A psychiatrist testifying for the daughters said <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> was incompetent `` due to the infirmities of old age.'' Another psychiatrist testified for the sons that while <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> needed help managing his finances, he found no evidence of incompetency. A third psychiatrist, appointed by the court, examined <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> seven weeks after he was declared incompetent and concluded that he is `` suffering from some mild cognitive impairment.'' When the guardianship was declared, <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> lost the right to vote, to make decisions about his own health care and to travel without approval from his guardian. Against his wishes, he was initially ordered back into a nursing home. Later, the judge allowed him to continue to live with son <PERSON> William </PERSON> in suburban <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> Tree </PERSON>, where he had moved after his wife's death The elder <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> is permitted to keep his monthly $ 537 Social Security check and his $ 210 pension check for expenses and for spending money. `` I think the <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> case provides an example of flaws in our current state law,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, secretary of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Department of Aging. Among proposed legal changes now before the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> is a provision to authorize limited guardianships for people who are only `` partially incapacitated,'' as two doctors found <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> to be. A number of states already allow such guardianships, which tailor assistance to specific areas, such as managing a person's income and assets, while leaving most rights intact Current <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law does not recognize partial incompetence and allows only for a blanket guardianship, under which virtually all decision-making is turned over to someone else. `` Here's an individual who could use some assistance in financial planning but certainly he can make choices we all make every day,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON>. At a Department of Aging hearing last month, <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> himself testified in favor of the reform bill, which would also eliminate `` infirmities of old age'' as a reason for a finding of incompetency. An individual's faculties, not birth date, should be the deciding factor, department officials have argued. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Wilke </PERSON> is challenging the incompetency finding. A hearing is set before an Orphans Court panel Sept. 12. As he sits in a rocking chair, watching the news or the <ORGANIZATION> Pirates </ORGANIZATION> ballgames, the white-haired man ponders what he'll do if he's declared competent and gets control of his money again He'll pay off some bills, he says, and visit his son <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> says his father also feels he should pay him and his wife, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, for his care and shelter, no more than $ 1,000 But reconciliation with his daughters is not in the cards. `` They're looking out for themselves, not me,'' he said. `` It hurt me a lot. I just ca n't forget.''

 <LOCATION> GA-RANKUWA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A creation of apartheid politics, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black medical school is producing 70 badly needed doctors a year, and even those who oppose it concede it is advancing black medicine in the country. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has 26 million blacks but only about 800 black doctors, as opposed to more than 21,000 white doctors among its 5 million whites. When the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> was established 11 years ago in the homeland of <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>, however, many activists rejected the school as an inferior institution built to keep medical training segregated. However, modern facilities and a qualified staff have helped the university graduate 273 doctors who work in some of the country's best hospitals as well as remote rural areas where health workers are in severely short supply `` The students reject the idea of segregated education, but we accept that we are getting good training,'' said a 26-year-old student asking to be identified only as <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON>. The school's new buildings and landscaped grounds sit behind a barbed-wire fence 20 miles outside <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, the capital. The pristine campus appears out of place in dusty, run-down Ga-Rankuwa, a sprawling collection of dirt roads and squatter shacks. Many of the prospective doctors come from similarly impoverished communities. Some students arriving for the six-year program live with electricity for the first time, and most have little or no experience in laboratories. `` When students come here, they face tremendous adjustments,'' said the vice principal, <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlsson </PERSON>, who is white, as are all the top administrators. `` The pace and the intensity of the program is unlike anything they've experienced previously.'' He said black public high schools do not adequately prepare students for the rigors of medical school, and therefore the university often selects older students with some practical medical experience. About half the students are at least 25 years old and most have worked in the health care field before enrolling, said <PERSON> Karlsson </PERSON>. The university offers remedial courses in most basic subjects, but the failure rate remains high. About 40 percent of the 120 first-year students fail, although they are given the chance to repeat. The university is expanding its entering class annually and is one of the largest medical schools in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with about 1,500 students including its denistry, veterinary, nursing and post-graduate programs. The school, referred to by the acronym <LOCATION> MEDUNSA </LOCATION>, produces half of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 140 new black physicians each year. The rest come from schools that are predominantly white, such as the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. `` MEDUNSA is producing some outstanding doctors,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Nthato </PERSON> <PERSON> Motlana </PERSON>, a prominent anti-apartheid activist who runs a clinic in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the black township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Motlana </PERSON> and other activists initially opposed MEDUNSA, calling it a `` racist plan to build black medical school out in the <PERSON> bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Motlana </PERSON> still opposes segregated schools, but says <ORGANIZATION> MEDUNSA </ORGANIZATION> has served to increase the meager supply of black doctors. Health services remain segregated, and the shortage of doctors and facilities is acute in most black areas. <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s main white hospitals are about 50 percent empty, while an average of more than 200 patients sleep on the floor each night at <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>'s 2,700-bed <ORGANIZATION> Baragwanath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, the only full-service health facility for the township's 2.5 million residents. Despite the overcrowding at black hospitals in urban areas, the quality of care is much higher than in rural areas where the doctors are far too few and the facilities often inadequate or non-existent, <PERSON> Motlana </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> MEDUNSA </ORGANIZATION> encourages graduates who want to work in rural areas, but most students are from the cities and see no incentive to relocate, school officials and students said. To combat the dearth of rural doctors, black homeland governments provide scholarships for MEDUNSA students, who then are required to return to work in the territories for several years after graduation. `` Until its becomes attrative for doctors to practice in rural areas most blacks will have trouble getting adequate health care,'' said <PERSON> Motlana </PERSON>. `` MEDUNSA has helped the situation, but it is not enough by itself.'' The university is financially supported by the South African government, but students are required to pay a tuition the equivalent of about $ 2,500 a year. Virturally every student receives some form of financial aid, however. School officials say <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies were generous with scholarship money, but many of them have pulled out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because of its apartheid policies and no longer donate funds.

 Buddhists in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> kill each other while saffron-robed monks shake fists against the government, violating a 2,500-year-old rule against taking life and a tradition of <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> clergy shunning politics. <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> societies from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> have proved as prone to violence as others in recent times despite the precepts of Lord <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>, the great religious teacher of the 5th century B.C. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, once a land of 90,000 monks in scores of quiet temples, was turned into a killing field by the savage <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The current government says 3 million died in the 1975-78 reign of terror. In wartime <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, protesting monks set themselves afire. More recently, conflict between the majority <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buddhists </ORGANIZATION> and Hindu Tamils have left more than 8,000 dead in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. A monk in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> told an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> visitor: `` If the government does n't change, the only way to prevent shedding the people's blood is to fight them to the death.'' The image of Buddhist gentleness persists, however. Proponents like to say Buddhists have not waged crusades or burned heretics at the stake, as Christians did, or established anything akin to today's strident Islamic states. <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s Theravada Buddhism, one of the religion's two major branches, places special emphasis on tolerance, equanimity and non-confrontation. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Klausner </PERSON>, an American expert on Thai culture, says Buddhists try to avoid the confrontational behavior _ a sharp word, a push, a slap _ others might employ in a situation of conflict. `` Violence is the last resort,'' he said, `` but when the eruption comes it's going to be more dramatic. The Thais say there is little maneuvering room between the smile and the knife.'' <PERSON> Chatsumarn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabilsingh </PERSON>, a religion professor at <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Thammasat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, believes Buddhism to a large extent explains why the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> put up with 26 years of authoritarian misrule before rising up last month Demonstrating along with students and workers were monks who, at least in Theravada tradition, are enjoined to restrict their activities to the sprititual. But monks marched, gave fiery speeches and were said to have largely replaced the government in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s second-largest city and a great religious cener. <PERSON> Klausner </PERSON> said in an interview that monks in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and to some degree <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> had `` legitimized a politial role for themselves.'' When <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was the colonial power in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, it reduced the power of the monkhood, or `` sangha,'' and the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> clergy assumed a political role, helping expel the alien, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> conquerors. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> became independent in 1948. Some analysts say many monks similarly regarded the socialism of military strongman Ne Win as an alien ideology and resented his efforts to co-opt and control clergy after he seized power in 1962. A strain of aggressiveness is a long-standing characteristic of <ORGANIZATION> Mahayana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buddhism </ORGANIZATION>, practiced in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. Buddhist-backed groups in 16th century <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would band together to overthrow feudal lords, and the monks of the Shaolin Temple in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were noted for truculence and their skill as warriors. The Shaolin Temple remains a center for the study of martial arts. About 70 people have been injured in recent fueding between the main <LOCATION> Chokey </LOCATION> sect in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and its rivals. The antagonists, including monks, have attacked one another with clubs, iron pipes and knives. Although <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s exiled religious leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, urges non-violent resistance to Chinese rule, young <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks led riots last year and in March. They were involved in throwing rocks, burning vehicles and the death of a policeman who was beaten and flung from a monastery window. In a little-publicized conflict, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> rebels called Chakmas raid villages and battle authorities in eastern <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> to halt government efforts to settle Moslems on land traditionally held by Buddhists. At least 4,000 people have been killed, by official count. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, which calls itself the `` Land of Smiles,'' has one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s highest homicide rates periodic outbursts of brutality. Faced with mounting evidence in the early 1980s that <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> pirates were killing and raping Vietnamese `` boat people,'' several officials said the equivalent of: `` They ca n't be Thais. Thais are Buddhists and Buddhists would n't act like that.'' <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> scholars say much of this violence, and political activism by the clergy, results from rapid modernization, economic inequalities and political repression. Chatsumarn, the <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> professor, said in an interview: `` Buddhism molds the mentality to be tolerant, to bear all, but even good Buddhists ca n't live solely on religion. Basic needs must be met and stomachs filled.''

<HEAD>Neighbors Remember Slain IRA Man As `Friendly Lad'</HEAD>

 The elderly manager of a hardware store in this farming village remembered <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON> as `` a friendly lad,'' a bricklayer who often dropped by for supplies. `` He just got caught up in the troubles because he knew nothing else,'' the manager said. `` He's only one of hundreds of young men in the area who have been harassed every day by the security forces.'' <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON>, 25, and two other local <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> men died in a British army ambush Aug. 30 as they drove along a country road near <LOCATION> Drumnakilly </LOCATION>, 5 miles north of here. Their funerals over the weekend drew mourners from all around the area and hundreds of riot police. The mourners, mostly Catholic, and the police, mostly Protestant, faced each other in stony silence. Physically, they were inches apart. Mentally, a gulf separated them. Police said the three dead men were armed and dressed in ski masks when they died. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspapers called them terrorists, murderers and `` IRA rats.'' But in the countryside of <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>, many residents knew these part-time guerrillas or their families and spoke of them in sympathetic terms. Their deaths helped exacerbate the divisions between local Catholics and the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s most frequent targets in rural districts _ the police and the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's a majority of Protestants with nothing wrong with them,'' said a 28-year-old decorator sitting on a grassy bank outside <ORGANIZATION> Dunmoyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday waiting for <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON>'s hearse to pass `` It's those that join the security forces we ca n't live with,'' he said, glancing at policemen searching mourners at a crossroads at the start of a two-mile trek to <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON>'s family farm outside <PERSON> Sixmilecross </PERSON>. Like the store manager, he spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation for criticizing the police. `` If you come up this road at 2 or 3 in the morning, and you're stopped by them, you're sure to get a kicking because of who you are,'' he said `` The police force would be welcome, surely, if they were 50-50 -LRB- Catholic-Protestant -RRB- and they were fair.'' The police and army say they ca n't get <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> recruits because the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> would kill them as collaborators. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Strabane </LOCATION> in neighboring <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fermanagh </LOCATION>, said he was a `` political activist'' with two sons serving lengthy prison sentences for <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombings. `` The British never listen to anything except a gun,'' he said. `` You could n't name three countries the British have not been at war with.'' The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite it with the 95 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Like many <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> recruits in rural districts alongside the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s border, the slain men led double lives, their <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> activities camouflaged by ordinary civilian pursuits. <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON>, who were buried Friday in their nearby home village of <LOCATION> Loughmacrory </LOCATION>, were leading players in the local Gaelic football team. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON>, a 29-year-old architect, designed his own grandiose house overlooking the village. His 21-year-old brother was a carpenter. Both were married, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> to <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON>'s sister, and each had an infant son Police said <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> was the commander of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s mid-Tyrone unit and that his brother was responsible for selecting <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> targets from police and <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> ranks <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON>, whose elder brother <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> is serving a life sentence for the 1977 <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> murder of a bus driver, was questioned after a bomb killed eight British soldiers Aug. 20 in a bus in nearby <LOCATION> Ballygawley </LOCATION>. He was released without charge after five days. News reports said the trio were on their way to kill an off-duty member of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION> when soldiers ambushed their stolen car. The government says the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> men fired first. At <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON>'s funeral, riot squads massed to block any repetition of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gun salutes that have sparked clashes with police at previous burials. The 2,000 mourners inched along narrow country lanes, flanked by long lines of police in helmets, guns and riot shields. They trudged through rain-sodden fields, climbing over ditches and hedges and scattering cows and sheep. When one policeman fell over a barbed-wire fence, the crowd roared approval. Police ringed the church walls during the Mass, sometimes banging batons against shields in what sounded like a tribal beat. Three officers videotaped the crowd, and a helicopter clattered overhead, almost drowning out the graveside prayers. When the service ended, the crowd quickly dispersed. The weather switched from driving rain to warm sunshine, and the tensions from the 3 -LCB- - hour service lifted

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> made it 11 in a row in the weekly <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings, but as summer reruns dragged into September, not that many people were watching. Reruns of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Full House'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Designing Women'' turned up in the top 10, but they were behind five <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> comedies. `` Full House'' is being broadcast two nights a week. A Tuesday episode came in sixth, but the episode on Friday, the regular time period, was 40th. The top 10 shows last week were: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Different World,'' `` Cheers,'' `` The Cosby Show,'' `` Night Court'' and `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Full House,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' and `` Amen''; and a tie between <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Blood and Orchids, Part Two'' and `` Designing Women'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> finished the week with an average, prime-time rating of 11.6; CBS 10.8; and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 9.3. The network averages for the season that began 50 weeks ago are: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 14.5, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> 12.3 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 12.1. The three-network share of the total viewing audience was 60, up somewhat from the the previous week's 56. The all-time low, set this summer, was 47. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million homes with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The `` CBS Evening News'' regained the lead in the news race with an average rating of 9.8 and a 21 share. `` ABC World News Tonight'' had a 9.4 and 20; `` NBC Nightly News'' an 8.8 and 19.

 Four decades after its founding, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> remains an isolated, secretive state with an enigmatic leader who shows no signs of handing over power to his designated heir _ his son. The Democratic People's Republic of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> celebrates its 40th anniversary Friday with praise for President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, 76, the communist strongman. The country plans a huge celebration, with senior foreign emissaries including President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> representing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s two major allies. No political figures or journalists from the West have been invited, and requests from Western news agencies to cover the anniversary have gone unanswered. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> rarely allows <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> journalists into the country. The ceremonies Friday will include a mass rally, a sports competition and cultural performances in praise of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>. `` Koreans respect <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> as a prominent leader in anti-Japanese warfare and hero of the Korean revolution,'' said <PERSON> Choe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ick </PERSON>, an official of the pro-North <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Residents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Chongryon </LOCATION> -RRB-. `` He goes to every corner of the country, among farmers and workers, to solve problems they face. The people respect this, and that is why he has remained in power so long.'' A 1986 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report called <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> `` the object of an intensive and far-reaching personality cult, probably unequalled in the rest of today's world.'' Huge statues of the Great Leader, as <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> is known, stand throughout the country and almost all <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> wear badges with his picture. Similar public loyalty to <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, 46, is encouraged. The elder <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> plans to hand power over to his son in what may be the world's first communist dynasty. It has been a troubling year for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. World attention has focused on rival <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and on the upcoming Olympic Games, which begin in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Sept. 17. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has stressed security preparations against a possible terrorist attack from the north. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> finally stated this week that it would not use military or other means to interrupt the Olympics. `` As for ` terrorism,' it is utterly alien to us and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> itself is the chieftain of state terrorism as already exposed to the world,'' the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. Tension remains high along the Demilitarized Zone with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s deployment of Soviet-made missiles and jet fighters, including MiG-23s and MiG-29s. The North has an estimated 850,000 troops _ the world's fifth largest army _ against 650,000 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> and 42,000 American soldiers. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> failed in its attempt to share in the glory of the Olympics, and is now watching allies <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and probably <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> establish trade relations with <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Eclipsed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in industry and foreign trade, the country faces two formidable tasks: ensuring a smooth transfer of power and modernizing its economy. The country has a foreign debt of about $ 4.2 billion against foreign trade of only $ 3.5 billion annually, according to Western estimates. Last year, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was declared in default on its foreign loans. Trade is modest, amounting to only $ 1.7 billion annually with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s largest trading partner and main economic benefactor. `` They -LRB- <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> -RRB- import machinery and vehicles, but lack parts and skill and ca n't get them repaired,'' a Japanese intelligence official said. To earn badly needed foreign currency, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is on a building spree of luxury hotels and sports and cultural facilities, but `` they're building everything literally by hand, with shovels and wheelbarrows,'' the official said. `` It reminds me of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the 1950s,'' said <PERSON> Masaru </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishida </PERSON>, a literature professor at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hosei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who has visited the country three times. Strapped for cash, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been shifting some of the 20 percent of its GNP currently spent on the military to joint ventures with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, according to the Japanese official. The products include household goods, clothing, shoes and are sold in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> wants to cut down military expenditures because they're a waste of money,'' said <PERSON> Choe </PERSON>. Authorities have demobilized 200,000 soldiers in the last two years and shifted them to economic reconstruction, he said. How to solidify the political position of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s son is a more delicate issue. Little is known about <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, but he clearly lacks the charisma of his father, the Japanese official said. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, 34, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>'s half-brother, has been posted as ambassador to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in an apparent move to avoid a challenge to <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, the official said. A major question is when <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> will abdicate in favor of his son _ or be forced to for health reasons. During a visit to <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> in July, he had difficulty climbing slopes and once abandoned an attempt to enter a pavillion because he could not negotiate the stairs, the Japanese official said. `` <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> wants quickly to give reins to his son,'' the official said. `` But the domestic situation does n't allow that right now.'' He said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had been pressuring <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> not to put his son in power yet because they do not have complete confidence in him.

 Do n't try to tell <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Camerada </PERSON> about <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> or <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>. He's got his own idol: <PERSON> Barnaby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` I just like his easygoing style,'' <PERSON> Camerada </PERSON> says. Camerada is not alone. He is one of more than 800 members of the <PERSON> Barnaby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Fan </PERSON> <PERSON> Club </PERSON>, dedicated to the memory of the venerable detective who ambled across the nation's television screens from 1973 to 1980, and in countless reruns. Unlike most fan clubs, the members of this one actually get to meet their idol regularly. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebsen </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, is a frequent guest at the club's weekly meetings at a restaurant off Times Square. `` It's a cult now,'' says <PERSON> Ebsen </PERSON>, 80. `` I love them. They're great guys. The great guys are mostly retired executives, men of <PERSON> Ebsen </PERSON>'s own generation. They include former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, a fan of the show who joined the club at <LOCATION> Ebsen </LOCATION>'s suggestion. This fan club collects no dues, sells nothing, follows no rules and only loosely organizes an occasional golf outing. `` It is instantaneous. You walk in and you're a member,'' said member <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Desimone </PERSON>, 57. `` It really was a sincere, grass-roots germination,'' <PERSON> Ebsen </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberti </PERSON> said the club started some years ago when a retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> colonel was hospitalized for an operation. Each day, the patient watched <PERSON> Barnaby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> reruns, and soon he and his visitors were hooked. Thereafter, they met for lunch or drinks each week. They would send <PERSON> Ebsen </PERSON> birthday cards each year. His curiosity was piqued, and one day he dropped in to La Vert-Galant, official meeting place of the <ORGANIZATION> BJFC </ORGANIZATION>. Now, whenever he's in town, <LOCATION> Ebsen </LOCATION> is a regular. And when he shows up, the bartender whips up an alcoholic drink that looks like the favored drink of the club's favorite detective _ a glass of milk. The meetings are not like Trekkie conventions _ there are no trivia contests, with questions of what color tie <PERSON> Barnaby </PERSON> wore in episode 33; there is no swap meet of <PERSON> Barnaby </PERSON> memorabilia. Mostly, the guys talk about sex, fights, baseball and dirty jokes. `` It's like a family,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, 60. The club has attracted Ebsen lookalikes and a Scottish man who, like <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, drank only milk. There are members in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Then there was the visit from <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ebsen </PERSON>, who is on the board of directors of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s library, said he recruited <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> into the club when <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> asked him why the <PERSON> Barnaby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> private detective show was taken off the air in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and how he could help get it back on. Now, said <PERSON> Ebsen </PERSON>, `` He's a card-carrying member.'' When <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> stopped by, more than 40 members gathered at the restaurant and listened to plenty of behind-the-scenes stuff, as <PERSON> Lamberti </PERSON> recalls. `` He was going to stay a half hour but he stayed two hours,'' he said. `` He told us things about <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that I ca n't tell you. He said of all the clubs he ever went to this was the greatest because there was no ulterior motive.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> also figured in another big moment in club history _ the time members rented a yacht and followed <PERSON> Ebsen </PERSON> in a race around <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` I had a <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> mask on,'' <PERSON> Lamberti </PERSON> said, with a chuckle. <PERSON> Ebsen </PERSON> said he recalls racing in the Liberty Regatta. There, tagging along behind him, was a yacht bearing a large banner. `` Go Barnaby,'' the sign said.

 A visiting-card case made from the skin of executed 19th century mass murderer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> was bought at auction for $ 1,785 by a man whose business takes tourists to the scenes of notorious crimes. `` The price was much more than <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, his accomplice, received for all the bodies of their victims, which they sold to anatomists,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who bought the relic in a sale at <LOCATION> Knowle </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, who began as grave-robbers, went on to murder at least 15 people in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> in 1827 and 1828, a time when medical professors could not get enough bodies for demonstrations to their students. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> was hanged in 1829 on the evidence of <LOCATION> Hare </LOCATION>, who fled the city and disappeared. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s body was flayed after dissection by <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>'s medical authorities and part of his skin was used by one of those surgeons to make the ornate case with gold tooling which passed to his descendant _ who sold it Wednesday.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> man with more than 20 years experience in nuclear energy, was hired Wednesday to succeed <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. White as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear program. White, 59, has run <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear program since January 1986, five months after the federal utility shut down its five-reactor system because of safety and management concerns. Since then, Unit 2 at <ORGANIZATION> Sequoyah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION> has returned to operation and Unit 1 is scheduled for restart later this month. <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> 2 is expected to be back on line by next spring. <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON>, vice president of nuclear operations for <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, will join <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 1 and assume command of the nuclear program a month later. <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> revealed <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON>'s appointment and <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s resignation during a TVA board meeting in <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>, Miss. `` <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> has done an excellent job of starting the <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> nuclear program on its way to complete recovery,'' <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>. `` His assignment is essentially complete and he has stated several times that he wants to return home to his farm in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> appreciates the work he has done in making our nuclear program safer,'' <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> said. White indicated in recent weeks that he would probably leave the $ 355,200-a-year job in January 1989 when his contract expires to be with his family in <LOCATION> Charlottsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The retired admiral who once headed the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear submarine program has also been under fire from congressional staffers critical of <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear program. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> is still investigating claims by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that White lied in March 1986 when he told the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s unlicensed Watts Bar Nuclear Plant near <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, met certain safety standards. White has denied the charges, and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Charnoff </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>, said he expects the investigation to be dismissed soon. Like White, <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> is an ex-Navy officer, retiring in 1971 to join <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as senior engineer in nuclear production. Unlike him, he will be paid as a <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> employee, not a contractor, and his $ 77,200 salary will be governed by a federal pay cap. He also will receive a $ 100,000 cash relocation incentive and $ 40,000 in retirement benefits.

At least 17 buildings were destroyed as the big North Fork fire moved into the outskirts of the complex Wednesday afternoon when 40-mph winds shifted, creating a wall of flame that forced 40 firefighters to retreat from the lines. `` When that firestorm went through there, we had to move our people out of there,'' said <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON>, fire incident commander. `` When you can feel the heat inside your car, it's time to move.'' Embers rained down on firefighters who wetted roofs inside the complex and activated a sprinkler atop the historic Old Faithful Inn to protect the 84-year-old log building, a national historic landmark since 1987. Two cabins in the employee housing area were destroyed by the wall of flame and winds gusting to 50 mph showered sparks into the complex, igniting the roofs of 14 other guest cabins and a utility shed, <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said. As winds died down late Wednesday night, authorities began to hope that the fire threat near the park's most popular attraction again was over. `` I would consider it over,'' <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said. `` The main fire front passed through here. It really fireproofed this area.'' Wednesday's evacuation of the geyser complex was the first in the 116-year history of the oldest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national park, ordered as the fire burned to within a half-mile of the park's most popular attraction. About 800 visitors calmly left the 320-room inn, which park officials decided to close for the season more than a month early. Later, however, park officials decided to allow day visitors in the area. Inside the complex, firefighters hosed down buildings to protect them from flames as a handful of tourists sightseeing when the flames erupted, were held in the area until fire activity slowed. `` It's the safest place to be in spite of what it feels like,'' <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said. `` I've been coming up here a long time,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a visitor from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` Thank God I've got a lot of pictures of the way the park was, because I'll never see it like that again.'' <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said he expected winds to subside by midnight and weather to remain calm Thursday and Friday, but he added forecasts called for a return of high winds by the weekend. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said a storm front could bring significant precipitation to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> by Sunday or Monday. Forecaster <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Oard </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, said the storm was `` looking more likely all the time.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> to declare their state a disaster area, eligible for relief because of the forest blazes in and around <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. The two Republicans also called for the resignation of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> for his service's policy of letting naturally-sparked fires burn unless they threaten manmade structures or people. However, in the last month <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> officials have tried to suppress all new fires, whether caused by man or nature, but unusually dry conditions and gusting winds thwarted efforts by thousands of firefighters. Fires in the <LOCATION> Greater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area, which includes nearby national parks in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, have charred close to 1 million acres, park spokeswoman <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Karle </PERSON> said. On Yellowstone's northern border, a river of fire flowed within feet of two small tourist towns, and firefighters hoped winds would continue to shepherd the Storm Creek fire past <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Silver Gate, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. Nearly 550 firefighters and a fleet of bulldozers were moved to the <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> area, across the state line in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, to keep the North Fork fire from spreading there. Forest fires also burned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Officials expected winds of 30 to 40 mph from midday to midnight, he said. <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said the 13 fires in the <LOCATION> Greater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area had advanced a total of about 80,000 acres on Tuesday. The fires burning in the park, which has a total of 2.2 million acres, are the worst by far in the park's history. In no year has the acreage consumed by fire exceeded 30,000 acres, park naturalists say. Elsewhere in the Greater Yellowstone complex: _ The 260,000-acre Clover Mist fire made a 10-mile run toward the east entrance of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. Fire information officer <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Damron </PERSON> said the fire grew 20,000 acres Tuesday night and endangered the Pahashka Tepee, which was <PERSON> Buffalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>'s original hunting lodge. The east and northeast gates to the park were both closed Wednesday. Two fires in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> have cut off access to the roads leading to the northeast entrance. _ The 224,600 Mink fire, 15 miles northeast of Moran Junction in the <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilderness </LOCATION>, continued to burn to the northeast near the boundary of the Bridger-Teton and Shoshone national forests. _ The 53,275-acre <PERSON> Huck </PERSON> fire spread to the southeast into the <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilderness </LOCATION> in the Bridger-Teton. _ The 22,195-acre <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION> fire, five miles east of <LOCATION> Pinedale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, continued to burn. In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, firefighters extinguished the last in a series of wildfires that blackened more than 25,000 acres. A shift in winds and weather and the use of irrigation systems spared central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s orchard belt from a 30,000-acre fire. The fire, 50 percent contained on Wednesday, was not expected to be completely contained before Friday, officials said. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, residents of more than 60 canyon homes were allowed to return home as firefighters neared containment of a 5,600-acre fire east of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, officials said. Fire bosses hoped to contain the fire by late Thursday. A fire in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> spread from 25,900 acres Monday to 36,780 by Tuesday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the coordinating office for firefighting in the West, said fires this year have charred 3.65 million acres, an area larger than <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. Slightly more than 2 million of the acres are in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. During the last big fire season, 1985, 2.8 million acres burned. The fire center has called this the worst fire season in 30 years.

<HEAD>US Share of World Wheat Market Falling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An expected 11 percent drop in wheat exports in 1988-89 will cut into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the world wheat trade, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts. `` World market share may fall from 43 percent in 1987-88 to about 40 percent,'' says the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Reduced sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are expected to account for most of the decline in volume.'' The drought-battered <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, which produces most of the spring-planted durum wheat used in spaghetti and other pasta products, suffered low yields this year. The report said tighter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> durum supplies may result in some market loss in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Some renewed activity in wheat sales resulted from the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, which provides subsidized sales to selected foreign countries, the report said. New offerings were made this summer to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. A rise in world grain prices has resulted in a reduction in <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> subsidies, the report said. The subsidies, or bonuses, are paid to exporters in the form of government-owned surplus commodities so the companies can sell wheat at reduced prices to meet foreign competition. Bonus levels have declined, averaging $ 17.80 per metric ton of wheat between Aug. 1 and Aug. 22, only about half that of a year earlier. `` The rising export price for wheat and the smaller <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> bonuses imply that <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> importers are picking up a greater share of the total cost,'' the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to produce a bumper wheat crop this year, is expected to be the major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitor in many export markets. However, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> was said to have limited exports through this month due to budget constraints and relatively tight wheat supplies. `` Other major competitors will not have the supplies to compete effectively with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in many markets,'' the report said. `` <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s carrying -LRB- beginning inventory -RRB- stocks are low and the drought is expected to leave <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with only 16 million tons of exportable supplies. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s exports at this level would be 32 percent below the 1987-88 record and the lowest since 1979-80.'' <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> were also said to have reduced or below-average wheat availability for export in the coming year. But higher wheat prices are expected to encourage minor exporters, such as Eastern European countries and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, particularly for durum wheat, the report said. Primary markets for these exporters will be <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

More than 2 million tons of corn have been sold in the last week, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announcements. All have been for delivery in the 1988-89 which began on Sept. 1. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 300,000 tons of corn would be about 11.8 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.72 per bushel at the farm level, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, meaning that the latest sale, announced Wednesday, could have a farm value of around $ 32 million. As with the other recent sales, no indication was given whether the new sales of corn would count under the current long-term grain supply agreement between the two countries or be carried forward separately in case a new pact is forthcoming. The current five-year pact is set to expire Sept. 30 and negotiators are trying to work out a new one, or at least an extension of the current agreement, to take effect Oct. 1.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Urban Air Cleanup Efforts May Be Missing Mark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Urban air cleanup programs are neglecting sources of pollution that might be killing trees in rural areas, according to an environmental researcher. By concentrating on efforts to limit emissions of hydrocarbons, rather than nitrogen oxides, the urban programs could be allowing nitric acids to form ozone in other areas, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON>, one of the authors of a report released today by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Emisson </PERSON>, said the agency's latest computer models showed no such result, at least for the Northeast. Ozone, which damages the lungs, is believed by many researchers to be helping to kill high-altitude red spruce in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and several species in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. It is formed from the reaction in sunlight of volatile hydrocarbons such as gasoline and the nitrogen oxides emitted in all combustion. Quite small concentrations of nitrogen oxides, in contact with hydrocarbon compounds from trees, can form ozone, according to research completed within the past year. The hydrocarbons from trees, mainly terpene or isoprene, `` in the presence of almost trace amounts of nitrogen oxides, about 1 part per billion, can produce fairly large amounts of ozone,'' noted a report authored by <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> and institute Vice President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Ashry </PERSON>. In trying to bring 68 cities and other areas into compliance with federal clean air standards for ozone, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> seeks lower emissions of compounds such as gasoline. In polluted urban areas, reductions in nitrogen oxides can increase ozone at first before eventually reducing it. `` All that -LRB- nitrogen oxide emitted in urban areas -RRB- is going to go somewhere. It's going to increase ozone in rural areas,'' <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I think -LRB- EPA's policy -RRB- is a mistake. ... In urban areas you have to reduce both'' hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, he said. <PERSON> Emisson </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards at Research Triangle Park, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said that with computer models, `` when we have looked at the Northeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a very crude scale, we do n't see big ozone concentrations taking place if you do n't control nitrogen oxides ... Very tentative results do not lead us to say there's a big problem in the forests.'' The institute surveyed the latest research on the effects of ozone and acid rain on crops and forests. Like many other environmental groups and several proposals in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, it called for a 50 percent reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide from industrial and utility fossil fuel burning, a major precursor of acid rain, and a 25 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides, which become nitric acid and increase rainfall acidity. Today's typical rural concentrations of ozone are roughly twice normal background. They probably reduce overall crop yields by 5 percent to 10 percent, resulting in the loss of about $ 5 billion a year, the report said. Ozone on rural mountain peaks in the east can approach levels <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has defined as unhealthy, and the frequent clouds shrouding the peaks can be 100 times more acidic than rainfall, the report noted. The report itself did not examine <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s urban-air strategies. Heavy doses of ozone have long been known to kill trees directly. The report outlined theories by which the acids and ozone in combination could be killing trees by leaching out nutrients or leaving them too ill to resist drought or insects. A 1987 scientific paper cited in the report said, `` In the absence of -LRB- man-made nitrogen oxide -RRB- emissions, isoprene contributes little to ozone formation.'' A simultaneous reduction of both nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons still might initially increase ozone in some urban areas, said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, an atmospheric chemist at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Emisson </PERSON> agreed, noting that no one knows yet which cities might reduce nitrogen oxides without increasing ozone locally. `` An approach that helps ozone in urban areas might not do a lot of good in rural areas,'' Ms. <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. `` It's important to recognize that this is being actively investigated and people are only beginning to grasp the science,'' but policymakers could find themselves forced to favor trees or people, she said. `` In a lot of the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION>, it does n't make a lot of difference'' to ozone formation whether urban nitrogen oxides are reduced, `` but if you get into the more forested areas it can make a difference,'' Ms. <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said.

 The stage is set for a showdown over a bill guaranteeing job-protected leave to new parents, with supporters urging politicians to `` put your votes where your mouths are'' or risk being turned out of office. `` If politicians truly want to capture women's votes, they must go beyond pro-family rhetoric and photo opportunities with children,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtman </PERSON>, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund. `` It's really quite simple: Put your votes where your mouths are.'' Added <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON>, chairman of the National Women's Political Caucus: `` We need a response beyond window dressing. The caucus is among more than two dozen women's groups, ranging from <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, mounting an intensive lobbying drive for the Family and Medical Leave Act. It is scheduled for a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote next Wednesday. The bill has 151 co-sponsors, but only 16 of them are Republicans. Compromises are being discussed with conservative lawmakers, many of them southern Democrats, as supporters attempt to secure a majority for the bill before the floor vote. The act would require businesses employing more than 50 people to offer unpaid job-protected leave of at least 10 weeks to parents of newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill children. At least 15 weeks would have to be available to employees suffering a serious illness themselves. An `` elder care'' provision would permit leaves to care for seriously ill parents. The elder care section is likely to die either in the House or later in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, supporters acknowledge, and the bill may ultimately guarantee workers a single 12-week leave for either illness or parental responsibilities. <PERSON> Lichtman </PERSON> cited several cases that illustrate why the legislation is needed. She described a baker who lost his job because he took off a day to be with his daughter during her heart operation; a postal worker denied a week of unpaid leave after his wife had twins, and a hospital supply technician who returned from an approved maternity leave to be told her job was gone. Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has endorsed the family leave bill. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes it but one women's group official said Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, was re-evaluating his position late last week. `` We think the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is showing some very good signs,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorian </PERSON>, executive director of the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> and Professional Women. `` There is room for some productive dialogue on this.'' Small businesses are planning a major lobbying effort next week against the family leave measure. `` What plant closings was to large business, this is to small business,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavenner </PERSON>, a founder of the 160-member Concerned Alliance of Responsible Employers. `` It's even more dangerous. ... They're telling <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s employers, ` We do n't care who needs it and who does n't, this is what you've got to do, whether or not you can afford it.'''

<HEAD>Bigger Cars Safer, but a Few Smaller Models Above Average Too</HEAD>

 The likelihood of injury from a car accident ranges widely among different car models, but for the most part safety increases with automobile size, according to an insurance industry report. The report on injury claims involving 207 popular models shows that small cars have by far the highest injury loss records, while station wagons and large cars often afford the greatest protection. According to the insurance group, the <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> SDL-SEL sedan, which is equipped with a driver-side airbag, had the best safety record with injury losses that were 58 percent lower than the average for all cars. Close behind was the Pontiac Safari station wagon. The least safe car was the 4-door Chevrolet Spectrum which had injury losses that were 78 percent above average, followed by the 4-door <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> and 4-door <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excel </ORGANIZATION>, both of which had losses 67 percent above average, the report said. Of the 10 cars with the best injury loss record, nine were categorized as `` large'' cars including five station wagons and vans. The Saab 9000 was the only `` mid-size'' car in the top 10 vehicles, ranking fifth best with injury losses 51 percent lower than average. The 10 vehicles with the worst injury loss record were all in the small sedan or small sports car category. Exceptions to the general trend that small cars afford the least protection include another <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> model, the Saab 900, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanagon </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> van, Porsche 944 coupe and <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> 380-560 SL convertible. All are in the `` small'' category but had better than average injury loss records. But except for the Saab 900, all 60 of the `` small'' sedan models had higher injury losses than average. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an insurance industry research group, covered 1985-87 model cars, but spokesmen said the findings can be used as a guide for later model vehicles as well. `` The loss experience of most cars is consistent from one model year to another,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, the institute's president. The report said the results were adjusted to take into account various `` non-vehicle factors'' such as types and ages of drivers that might be associated with particular vehicles. The 2-door Chevrolet Cavalier was the only mid-size car to have `` substantially worse than average'' injury losses _ 36 percent worse than average for all vehicles. All but two of the 35 `` large'' cars, station wagons, vans and speciality cars had lower than average injury losses. The 4-door <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 88 and <PERSON> Cadillac </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleetwood-Deville </PERSON> were the exceptions, ranked as average. Of the 207 cars and vans included in the study, 40 had safety records that were characterized as `` substantially better'' than average, while 32 were `` substantially worse.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has decided not to contest a <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> fine of $ 1.25 million for failing to prevent control room workers from sleeping on duty at <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s Peach Bottom nuclear plant, officials said. The fine is the largest ever imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>. The utility is expected to announce later this week or Monday that it intends to pay its share of the fine, which amounts to about $ 531,000, according to <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> officials who spoke Wednesday on condition of anonymity. Three other utilities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> are liable for portions of the fine because they are part owners of the plant at <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania-Maryland </LOCATION> border, according to <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, the plant operator. The fine was assessed on Aug. 11 `` for failing to detect, report and deal with inattentive operators, and supervisors who condoned it.'' Thirty-three present and former Peach Bottom reactor operators have been fined between $ 500 and $ 1,000 by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> for `` sleeping and-or other acts of inattention to duty.'' Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> called the levy a `` proposed fine,'' explaining that the utility had 30 days either to admit or deny the proposed violations. If it admits the allegations, <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> is required to list any corrective actions. <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Wednesday that a decision had been made, `` but obviously I'm not at liberty to say what it is.'' However, two officials said the company had decided to pay the fine in the interest of putting the issue behind it and focusing on getting the plant restarted. If it admits the allegations, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> will be liable for about $ 531,000, or 42.49 percent of the fine. That is the percentage share of <ORGANIZATION> Peach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottom </ORGANIZATION> held by <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the plant. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, also owns 42.49 percent of the plant. Other co-owners are <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Delmarva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, both with 7.51 percent. The Peach Bottom fine is the largest since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> authority to issue civil penalties in 1969. But it pales in comparison to the $ 100 million that <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> has already lost because of the cost of purchasing replacement power. Peach Bottom, which is capable of producing 1 million kilowatts of electric power, was ordered shut down by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> on March 31, 1987, because operators sleeping on duty were said to pose a safety threat. Since then, <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> has shuffled management at the plant and ordered reactor operators retrained.

<HEAD>Senate Acts to Force Vote on Textile Import Curbs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is preparing to act on proposed new limits on textile, apparel and shoe imports, giving little heed to complaints that it is reverting to protectionism. `` The textile and apparel industries will be extinct in a few years unless the flooding of our markets is stopped,'' Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 68-29 to force action on the longstanding issue. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted to limit debate, giving opponents of the proposed restrictions no more than 30 hours to express their objections. As a result, action on the bill is expected by Friday at the latest. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> allies of the textile and apparel industries were in command of the debate at all times. Critics, who say <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers are exaggerating their problems to win special treatment, were reduced to giving their adversaries a futile, daylong tongue-lashing. `` You are being absolutely shameless,'' declared Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, who opposes the measure. Under the bill, this year's textile and apparel imports would be frozen at 1987 levels and growth would be limited to 1 percent annually in succeeding years. Non-rubber footwear imports would be capped at 1987 levels. The president would be authorized to compensate countries hurt by the restrictions by negotiating tariff cuts. Textile-state lawmakers and their free-trade critics butted heads over just how much the industry is earning. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that before-taxes earnings of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> textile companies zoomed 26 percent last year That brought <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> rushing to the floor with figures suggesting a 12 percent drop in profits thus far this year. Prospects for the bill remain clouded despite the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s action The House has passed a differing version and it is unclear whether compromise can be reached in the month remaining before lawmakers adjourn. A veto also is a possibility. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed a similar bill in 1985 and the administration is suggesting that the same fate may await the latest version. A wave of Asian textile and apparel imports jolted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers in the early 1980s and they have been seeking congressional import curbs ever since. Textile and apparel companies as well as their allies in the shoe industry and a variety of labor unions say such restrictions are needed to salvage jobs in an industry whose very existence they claim is threatened by foreign competition. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and lawmakers from export-minded states, however, have been pointing to an upturn in textile industry earnings. They say a steep fall in employment represents a shakeout traceable largely to increased productivity and efficiency. Layoffs came at the same time as a modernization of many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> textile plants with automated equipment. The upgrading came in large part as a response to increased competition from overseas manufacturers, mainly in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. But apparel manufacturing has not been able to automate to anything near the same extent. As a result, labor-intensive, low-wage companies in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> have enjoyed a substantial advantage in many cases.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who stunned Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a barrage of tough attacks on the presidential campaign trail last month, is trying for a different image in his opening television ads. `` I want a kinder and gentler nation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in his convention acceptance speech. That moment and others like it are now being replayed for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> audiences in two 30-second spots. The `` kinder and gentler'' pitch was designed in large part to increase <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lagging support among women voters. It is being replayed in an ad called `` The Future,'' in which domestic images of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cooking at the stove, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> eating at a picnic and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kissing a grandchild are mixed in with excerpts from his speech. `` I'm a quiet man but I hear the quiet people others do n't. ... I hear them and I am moved,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continues. `` The president,'' intones a honey-voiced narrator. `` The heart, the soul, the conscience of the nation.'' A second <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ad, also running in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, features another moment in his acceptance speech. After describing his years serving `` a great president,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says it all comes down to `` the man at the desk, and who should sit at that desk.'' Cheers break out on the convention floor as he declares, `` My friends, I am that man.'' Scenes of the convention alternate with shots of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, strikingly lit in the dark of night. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is competing with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on both the compassion and competence fronts, mostly in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ like <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, another critical battleground. A <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spot running in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> shows a padlocked plant gate as a narrator asks, `` Should n't there be a law to give you and your community 60 days' notice? <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says no and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> led the fight in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> against making it a law.'' The ad says the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had one of the first such laws in the country passed and touts <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, his running mate, as `` the man who won the fight to make 60-day notification law.'' The two are shown in their shirtsleeves, chatting genially with a group of workers at a plant. `` Who cares about your life?'' a narrator asks in closing. `` The choice is clear.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also has revived an ad called `` New Era,'' which ran in a limited fashion during the Republican convention and started up Wednesday on national network television. The spot features excerpts from his acceptance speech and a list of his accomplishments as governor. Neither campaign is using negative ads yet, but the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> unveiled one Wednesday and said it would start airing late this week. Called `` Hey Pal,'' the spot charges that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> is responsible for tripling the federal deficit from $ 900 billion in 1980 to $ 2.6 trillion this year. `` We ca n't afford the Republicans,'' it concludes. The generic ad was scheduled to play in several battleground states, but the campaign declined to specify which ones. A group called Americans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, not associated with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, has prepared two ads slamming <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record on crime and plans to show them on several national cable networks. The ads were to be shown at a news conference today.

 It was an ambush. More than a dozen youths waited menacingly outside the entrance in <LOCATION> Blacksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where, in a few minutes, an older, wealthy man was expected to emerge. Would he give them what they wanted? What the fraternity brothers from <ORGANIZATION> Sigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nu </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> wanted, it seems, was a secret handshake. And they wanted it from Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee who had just addressed a rally at their school. More than 40 years ago, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was the president of his Sigma Nu chapter at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>. And the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> students wanted to give him a proper send-off. A handful of reporters waited in suspense to see if he remembered. Exactly what he was supposed to remember could not be determined. A conversation with one of the sweat-shirted frat members went something like this: What does your secret handshake look like? `` You ca n't see it.'' How will you know when he does it? `` We'll know.'' Do you think he'll remember it? `` He'll know.'' The media watched anxiously as <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> emerged. He started shaking hands, moving toward the gathering between him and his car. Suddenly, there was a puzzled look in his face. A moment of hesitation. Then a smile. And the Sigma Nus cheered. They posed gleefully for pictures with their older frat brother, who beamed. Later, on his campaign plane, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> confirmed what reporters could not see. He had remembered. `` Yes _ thank the Lord,'' he said, with an exaggerated sigh of relief. What was it exactly that he did, he was asked. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> just smiled _ the secret's good with him. Evidently some other secrets are safe as well. When a reporter asked for some stories about life back at <LOCATION> Sigma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> scolded, `` Get back to the back of the plane.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s wife, B.A., was monitoring that exchange.

 By far the most frequent non-political topic of conversation among reporters covering the campaigns this year is airplanes. Several times campaign jets have been grounded because of malfunctions and safety concerns, earning planes nicknames such as `` Sky Pig.'' Pilots have been dubbed `` Captain Crash.'' But when campaigning with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> it's clear he still sees romance in the air despite surviving a couple of crash landings in his life. In his political rhetoric, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> talks about the Republican opposition being on `` auto-pilot'' and says <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs to `` set its sights'' on something, recalling his World War II days as a bomber pilot. After his big <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 campaign jet was grounded in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, last month, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was forced to travel to <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, in a fleet of three small twin-engine propeller planes. Along the way, he reminisced about flying his own small plane with <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to retrieve Lady Bird one time when the LBJ Ranch was flooded. And he recalled how <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had forty years ago campaigned for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by helicopter _ when those craft were so rare that excited crowds would form at the pulsing sound of the rotors arriving in town. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> would throw his cowboy hat from the chopper, and then greet the gatherings when he went to retrieve it. Well, modern campaign jets certainly did n't have the same panache. But what about a fleet of those smaller planes, barnstorming around the country. A <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> air force? `` We could fly down the runways in formation, and then peel off one at a time,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, demonstrating with his hands.

 For four days before Labor Day, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> disappeared from the campaign trail for some relaxation at a friend's ranch in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Responding to reporters' questions on his first outing on Labor Day, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he played a lot of tennis, rested, and went fishing with what he claimed was great success. `` Hold up your hand,'' he told a reporter a few rows back on the plane.

<HEAD>Bacteria Found To Pass On Acquired Characteristics To Offspring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Bacteria can pass on to their offspring characteristics they acquire during their lifetimes, according to a discovery that challenges one of the central tenets of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON>'s theory of evolution. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cairns </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> reported today that bacteria threatened with starvation can size up their troubles and mutate in ways that enable them to survive. <PERSON> Cairns </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the inheritance of acquired characteristics can probably occur in other single-celled organisms like algae and fungi but is unlikely to occur in higher animals. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>, a professor of molecular genetics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, said of <PERSON> Cairns </PERSON>' finding, `` It will be very interesting to a lot of biologists. Whether it's important _ it wo n't do anything to reduce the national debt.'' The idea that acquired characteristics could be passed on to succeeding generations was proposed early in the 19th century by <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamarck </PERSON>. But Lamarckism, as the theory was called, was generally discarded early in this century, said <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>. If Lamarckism is correct, it would mean that a blacksmith, for example, who developed strong muscles during his lifetime, would be destined to have children with stronger-than-average muscles, said <PERSON> Cairns </PERSON>. The idea fell out of favor, <PERSON> Cairns </PERSON> said, because biologists could never explain how changes in muscles could lead to changes in sperm and eggs _ which would be necessary if the blacksmith's acquired characteristics were to be passed on to his children <PERSON> Cairns </PERSON> and his colleagues, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Overbaugh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, report their findings in Nature magazine. In an accompanying article, <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> said the job of biologists now is to explain how bacteria can do this. Natural selection, <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON>'s theory that stands in opposition to Lamarckism, says that mutations arise spontaneously in organisms, and by chance some of those mutations may allow an organism to survive better than others of its kind. <PERSON> Cairns </PERSON> showed that the life-saving mutations in the bacteria he studied were produced in response to the stressful situation _ they were not naturally occurring variations that simply turned out to be advantageous.

<HEAD>Commercial Bank Profits Soaring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Profits at the nation's commercial banks are soaring toward record levels this year after hitting bottom in 1987 when big banks wrote off billions in Third World loans, the government says. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that 13,403 banks reported $ 10.5 billion in earnings for the six months ending June 30. That is the biggest six-month profit since the agency began keeping track in 1934, topping the $ 9.7 billion in net income for the second and third quarters of 1985. `` We think ... we will see record profits for the year if the economy continues on its current level,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, whose agency insures commercial bank deposits up to $ 100,000. The most profitable year for banking was 1985, when the industry posted earnings of $ 18.1 billion. In the first half of 1987, banks lost $ 5.4 billion and went on for the full year to post the weakest earnings since the Depression, $ 3.7 billion. The poor performance was almost entirely attributable to huge reserves set aside by the largest banks for expected losses on loans to Third World countries. Banks have n't seen the need to build those reserves further this year and are thus earning strong profits. They set aside only $ 916 million on foreign loans in the first six months of this year, compared with $ 16.4 billion in the same period a year ago. But even as industrywide earnings are climbing, the number of bank failures also seems certain to set a post-Depression record. More than half of the failures have been in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a state still reeling from the worldwide depression in the oil industry and the resulting slump in Southwestern real estate prices. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks lost $ 2.9 billion in the first half, with $ 2.3 billion of that attributable to a single institution: <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, which has since been rescued with $ 4 billion in federal money. Elsewhere in the oil-dependent <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, banks earned modest profits. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said he hoped that the condition of banks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> would improve now that so many have been closed or merged with healthier institutions. At the end of August, 173 banks had failed or required government assistance to stay open. Ninety-seven of those _ including 42 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries _ were in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said failures would continue at the same rate this year, setting a post-Depression record, but then decline next year. In the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, battered earlier in the decade by farm bank failures, the profitability of most banks has been restored. In the first half, just 7 percent of banks in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> lost money, compared with nearly double that amount a year ago. Farm losses caused by this year' drought may check the improvement in banks in the region, but <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> banks should be able to weather any difficulties because they've lent more carefully than in the past and because of government aid to farmers Other figures cited by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> include: _ The number of unprofitable banks has dropped from 2,243 in the first six months of 1987 to 1,729 this year _ Banks on the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s problem list dropped from a peak of 1,601 at midyear 1987 to 1,455 on June 30 of this year _ Bad loans, those on which payments are not being made, totaled $ 73.4 billion in the second quarter, 3 percent less than a year ago _ Bank lending in real estate and to consumers grew at the expense of traditional commercial loans to business Much of the expansion in real estate loans was to build commercial projects such as offices and shopping centers. Much of the growth in consumer lending was in home equity loans. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> also noted that growth in commercial bank deposits barely matches inflation and is not keeping up with growth in the economy. Meanwhile, deposits at savings and loan institutions have grown twice as fast, he said. Many insolvent S & amp; Ls, which have not yet been closed by regulators, are paying high interest rates in order to attract depositors.

<HEAD>U.N.'s Dilemma: Going Broke, But Holding $7.2 Billion</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials are caught in a maddening situation, sitting on a $ 7.2 billion nest egg they ca n't touch while planning to close the world body next month for lack of cash. Members countries owe the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> $ 602 million in dues. Two-thirds of it is owed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has been withholding funds to try to force the world body to implement fiscal reforms. Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, says the organization will be unable to meet its payroll and other fixed expenses by late October if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does n't pay some of its $ 467 million debt. Meanwhile, the untouchable pension fund managed by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> since 1949 has grown to a gross value of $ 7.2 billion, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> manages the pension fund for its employees and those of 16 related agencies such as <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. About 43 percent of the fund is invested in stocks; 34 percent in bonds; 11 percent in real estate funds, but not in any actual property; and 12 percent is in short-term investments, said the official. The investments are spread among 27 different currencies in 44 nations, so the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> pension fund wo n't be sapped by currency fluctuations. The fund grew at an average rate of 22.3 percent each year for five years while riding the stock market boom, a cycle that went bust last October when the markets crashed. Because of the diversity of the fund, it lost only about 5 percent of its value in the crash, the official said. About 54,000 participants are paying into the fund, and about 27,000 people are receiving benefits, he said. While the pension fund is solvent, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget is about to go bust. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is assessed one-fourth of the regular <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget, which in 1988 was $ 876 million. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated $ 144 million this year toward <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> dues but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has paid only $ 60 million. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began withholding a portion of its dues early in the 1980s due to displeasure over anti-U.S. and anti-Israel rhetoric in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, and to save funds at a time when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit was growing rapidly. More recently, funds have been withheld in an effort to force the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to cut its staff by 15 percent, reduce expenses and make personnel changes. In particular, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants Soviet <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> staffers converted from temporary contracts to permanent international civil servant status, thus making them independent of the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s policy goals _ at least in theory The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has said it will transfer some of its <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> staff to the international civil service, but so far none of its <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> employees has been reassigned. Trimming spending in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s regular budget is an ongoing battle currently being fought in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s key budget committee, the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> and Coordination. That committee consists of 34 nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the other large contributors. They began meeting on Tuesday for two weeks to consider the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s budgets for 1990 and 1991. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials hope the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be satisfied enough with the proposals presented to the committee to release more than $ 100 million in back dues. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> opens Sept. 20, the day after the committee finishes its work. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may face a chilly reception when he addresses the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 26 if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is still as deep in arrears, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> staff and diplomats say.

 An election-year bookkeeping change pushed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration will cause official estimates of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit to drop $ 1.5 billion a month, even though the actual imbalance wo n't have changed at all. The change is being made two months before a presidential election in which <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has repeatedly attacked soaring trade deficits, calling them examples of failed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration economic policies. <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> defended the change at a briefing Wednesday, telling reporters it was not an effort to manipulate government statistics for political purposes. `` It does n't change the basic story,'' he said. `` Either way the trade deficit is still large, but it is now improving substantially.'' The monthly merchandise trade report due out next week will be the first to reflect the new accounting procedure. It will show that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is importing about $ 1.5 billion less each month even though the total amount of color televisions, cars and other foreign products purchased by Americans will not have changed at all. Since the official import figure will be on average $ 1.5 billion lower, the closely watched monthly trade deficit, the difference between imports and exports, also will be $ 1.5 billion lower. Since 1979, the government has included the costs paid to foreigners to ship and insure their products as part of the country's total import bill. Before then, the monthly merchandise trade figures did not include shipping and insurance costs for imports. These payments were classified as a service and were added to a quarterly trade report known as the current account, which reflects <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> transactions in both goods and services. Former Sen. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., sponsored an amendment in 1979 that changed the merchandise trade report to include the insurance and shipping costs, arguing that without these costs, the monthly trade report did not properly reflect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> obligations to foreigners The Long amendment prohibited the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from releasing any trade figures stripped of insurance and shipping costs until 48 hours after release of the initial trade report. The government continued to release the lower import figures, but they received little notice compared to the initial trade report, with its larger deficit. The administration has now changed that process by getting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve an amendment removing the 48-hour delay requirement. The change, which attracted little notice, was part of the 1,000-page omnibus trade bill. Beginning with next Wednesday's release of the July merchandise trade report, the government will release both sets of import statistics. Beginning next year, only the trade data minus shipping costs will be released, <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> said. He said the other figure will still be compiled and will be available to those who request it. <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> said the new accounting process would put service payments for shipping and insurance where they belong in the services category of the current account, the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade. `` This will give a slightly rosier tint to the numbers, but from an economists' point of view it makes sense to have exports and imports on the same basis. I do n't object to the method at all,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm. But <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said political motivations almost certainly played a role in the action. `` There were politics involved on both sides. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> wanted to embarrass the administration with higher trade deficits and this move is political as well,'' he said. `` If politics did n't enter in, then they would have waited until next year to introduce the new system. However, <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> said that by publishing both import figures, it would be up to the news media to decide which one to emphasize. The merchandise trade deficit for 1987 under the old system was $ 170.3 billion. With shipping removed, the deficit would have been a lower $ 152.1 billion. But that would still be a record, up 10 percent from a $ 138.3 billion 1986 deficit as calculated with the revised accounting procedure.

 A 63-year-old real estate broker, saying she was middle class `` and the middle class always needs money,'' stepped forward Wednesday to claim a record world lottery prize of $ 55 million. The winner, <PERSON> Sheelah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Winter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, said she watched Saturday's drawing on television and realized then that she had the winning ticket. `` I just kept saying ` Oh, my God,'' she told a room packed with journalists as she was introduced at the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said she did n't know what she'd do with her winnings, but did n't think that finding things to do with the wealth would be a problem. `` I've always been middle class and the middle class always needs money,'' she said. The first of 20 annual installments of $ 2,767,361 _ less 20 percent withheld for the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> _ is due to be paid to Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> next week. She said she did n't know if she'd quit her job. The native New Yorker, a single woman with no children who said her hobbies were tennis and music, moved to central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1975. She said her relatives include a brother and nephews in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She said her Wednesday flight to <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> to present the winning ticket was her first plane ride. `` I've had three firsts today,'' she said. `` It has been my first plane ride. ... No. 2, this is my first press conference. No. 3, this is the first time I've ever won $ 55 million.'' It was Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s third winning ticket in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 8-month-old lottery _ the other two prizes were for $ 4 each. She picked the first six numbers she came across in various stories on the front page of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> last week and bought the winning ticket Friday at a grocery store in <LOCATION> Longwood </LOCATION>, like <LOCATION> Winter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> a suburb of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. The winning combo was 3, 5, 19, 20, 27, and 35. `` These numbers were driving me crazy,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said she had been buying four tickets a week until <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> offered a $ 23 million jackpot in early August. Since then, she's been buying five tickets. Before Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> claimed her prize, several dozen other people claimed they had the winning ticket. It's not a crime to claim a winning lottery ticket, but it's a felony to present an altered lottery ticket for payment. One of the claimants was <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, an elementary school janitor in the tiny hamlet of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, about 280 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Longwood </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s claim was enough to get him a $ 23,000 Chevrolet van with no cash down, but Wednesday morning in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, he submitted only a photostat copy of a ticket, saying the original had been damaged in the laundry. `` We have denied Mr. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s claim based on the fact he does not have the original of his ticket,'' said a statement by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Lottery's verification procedures on the copy provided by Mr. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> indicate that he does not have the winning ticket. It was not immediately clear whether officials would pursue charges against <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, based on his submissal of the photostat lottery ticket. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> was in a meeting Wednesday afternoon and not available for comment, his office said. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, owner of a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chevrolet </LOCATION> dealership, said he let <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> drive away in a brand new mauve van after Liberty County Sheriff <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> told his credit manager that <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s ticket was genuine. `` We're sorry for him, but we're not too shook up about it,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said Wednesday afternoon upon learning that <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was n't a winner. He said he expects to get the van back, and joked that `` maybe we'll raffle it off.'' Several dozen people called the department claiming to have the winning ticket, according to Lottery Secretary <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. The jackpot's final value was put at $ 55.16 million. Earlier estimates put the jackpot at $ 54 million. It was the largest single lottery jackpot in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Previously, the largest single jackpot in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history was the $ 46 million that went to <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON> Sr. and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Despot </PERSON>, a couple, of <LOCATION> Hollidaysburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, last October. Two individual ticket-buyers divided a $ 51.4 million <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lottery jackpot in June. Two other large lottery drawings that were held Saturday night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> totaled $ 44 million, bringing the night's take for the three states to nearly $ 100 million In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, $ 23 million winner <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>, 29, of <PERSON> Port </PERSON> <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> said he would quit his job as a truck driver and his wife, <PERSON> Connie </PERSON>, said, `` I'd like to see <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. All of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, four ticket-buyers split a $ 21 million jackpot. As of Wednesday afternoon, only one of the four had come forward. Lottery officials identified them as the <PERSON> Kole </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a machine operator, her four children and a cousin, who asked officials not to give out their full names.

 The Senate has voted unanimously to ratify two international conventions that were prompted largely by the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear plant disaster in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The accords, approved by a 97-0 vote Wednesday, were negotiated under auspices of the Vienna-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. In the wake of the April 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> accident, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> came under heavy criticism for delaying release of information on the reactor explosion to the outside world until large amounts of airborne radioactivity were detected in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Representatives of more than 60 countries met in the summer of 1986 to negotiate the two pacts: the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency. The notification convention has been signed by 72 countries, while the assistance convention has 70 signatories. In urging ratification, Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called the two conventions `` positive international achievements'' that could prove invaluable in case of another Chernobyl-scale nuclear accident. Under the early notification convention, each signatory nation pledges prompt notification of other affected countries and the atomic energy agency in case of a nuclear accident that is likely to result in the spread of radioactivity beyond its borders. Information to be provided includes: _ The time, exact location and nature of the accident _ The nuclear facility or activity involved _ The assumed or established cause and foreseeable further development of the accident _ Characteristics of the radioactivity released by the accident _ Weather conditions _ Environmental monitoring and protective measures taken or planned in the vicinity of the accident The second convention establishes an international legal framework for assistance by other nations in case it is requested by the government of a country hit by a major nuclear accident. It seeks to encourage such help, while not obligating any nation to provide assistance.

<TEXT>
 The Cabinet voted to cut the pay of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and other top officials because of a cash shortage caused in part by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions. A Cabinet resolution passed Tuesday mandates pay cuts of 12.5 percent to 30 percent for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> and heads of state-owned companies. The government did not provide the individuals' salaries, but it said they make more than $ 3,000 a month. Salaries will return to normal `` when public finances allow,'' a government communique said. It acknowledged a `` deterioration'' in state income and said the pay cuts will save the government $ 230,000 a month. Business sources say the size of the economy is about half what it was in early 1987, before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions in an attempt to drive <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of the Defense Forces and the real power behind the civilian government, is reputed to have become independently wealthy during his military career. He is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies the drug trafficking charges and says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to undermine the Panamanian government as part of a plan to renege on the 1977 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties. Under the treaties, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> must cede control of the canal at the turn of the century. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday marked the 11th anniversary of the treaties, saying it would respect the accords but that relations with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> could improve only with a democratic government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` Panamanians and North Americans have worked together to implement the treaties and to ensure the continued and efficient operation of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. We promise that this will continue,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. It said, however, that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government `` continues believing that relations between our two peoples will be stronger when democracy is restored in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Amnesty Urges Brazil To End Land-Related Killings, Abuse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 1,000 people have died since 1980 in land disputes in northern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, where landowners hire gunmen to abuse or kill peasants, Indians, church workers and trade unionists, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said today. The London-based human rights group chastised <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> authorities for not enforcing laws to stem the violence and said it has evidence public servants were themselves involved in some incidents. Land reform is a deeply divisive issue in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, where 4 percent of the population of 141 million own almost half the arable land. Amnesty said the report that although it takes no position on land issues, it was `` alarmed at systematic and widespread failure to enforce the rule of law which has led to serious human rights violations in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.'' The report accuses authorities of allowing abuses to go virtually unpunished and speaks of `` overwhelming evidence that the intimidation and violence of landowners and land speculators is not only sanctioned, but frequently assisted by state authorities.'' In an example of official indifference, the report said, a police chief at <LOCATION> Goianesiua </LOCATION> police station in <LOCATION> Para </LOCATION> state allegedly told one woman whose husband and son were shot dead in October 1987 that he could not register the crime because he had no pen and paper. In addition to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in land disputes since 1980, hundreds more were tortured or ill-treated and countless others were forced off their land, the group said. It said it sent its report to <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> authorities in April and discussed its concerns with senior federal government officials in the capital city of <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> in June. The officials acknowleged state action had been inadequate `` but did not accept that this called for direct federal intervention,'' <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. The group said evidence suggested most of the killings were carried out by gunmen hired by landowners to terrorize and evict those considered a threat to their interests. Most victims were peasants, native Indians, priests, nuns, church workers, lawyers and trade unionists, it said. The report quotes the <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> as saying killings can allegedly be contracted through a `` death syndicate'' with offices in <LOCATION> Imperatriz </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Maranhao </LOCATION> state. It says police are reported to have been recruited by such syndicates. `` Local police treat these killings so lightly that they often do not bother to register the crimes,'' the report says. `` Even when crimes are recorded, police have failed to collect evidence and ignored routine procedures such as visiting the scene of the crime and interviewing suspects,'' it says. Convictions or punishments were imposed only in two land-related killings, the report says. It says police routinely carry out arbitrary arrests of peasants, mistreat and sometimes torture them and evict them from their land illegally, apparently to discourage them from pursuing political activities. It says hired gunmen sometimes accompany police. In February 1987, military police are reported to have illegally rounded up 50 peasants, including children, in the vicinity of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Geraldo </LOCATION> do <LOCATION> Araguaia </LOCATION>, south <LOCATION> Para </LOCATION>, and marched them at gunpoint to a landowner's ranch house, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. `` They are alleged to have raped two women, savagely beaten the peasants with rifle butts and sticks, compelled some to eat excrement, thorns and lighted cigarettes and forced bottles down the throats of others,'' it said. `` None of the peasants returned to their land afterward.'' Peasants arrested after gunmen or landowners were killed were held incommunicado without judicial order and mistreated or even tortured to obtain confessions or statements that would incriminate others, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Poet's Son Denies Wrong Bones Were Reburied in Ireland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The son of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> says he has the documentation to disprove a biographer's claim that the poet's bones are in a pauper's grave in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, not in <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>' grave in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> English biographer <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Souhami </PERSON> says <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> was buried in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in a mass paupers' grave and that when the bones were dug up for transfer to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in 1948, there was no way of telling whose bones they were. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> accused Ms. <PERSON> Souhami </PERSON> of `` whipping up cheap publicity out of a great man's death,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. He called her claims `` the greatest nonsense'' and said, `` It is absolutely certain that my father is buried in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION>. I have the documentation to prove it,'' the newspaper said. Ms. <PERSON> Souhami </PERSON> based her claim Tuesday on a mix-up she said she found in the papers of <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>' friend, the painter <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gluck </PERSON>. She is working on a biography of the painter, who she said tried for years to convince <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>' friends of the mistake. She cited correspondence between <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>' friends and the keeper of the cemetery in <LOCATION> Roquebrun </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, saying it was impossible to establish that the remains were the poet's. The younger <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> was quoted as saying when his father died in 1939, the body was not put in a pauper's grave but placed in a temporary grave, and its transfer to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> was delayed by World War II. Nine years later, the poet was exhumed, his bones measured and the remains placed in a casket for transfer to <LOCATION> Drumcliffe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION>, where he had asked to be buried, <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> as saying his mother oversaw the whole operation to transfer the bones and that he had documents from various officials who witnessed the procedure. Ms. <PERSON> Souhami </PERSON> said she never sought the kind of publicity to which <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> referred, and `` offending people certainly was n't my intention.'' `` I'm sure he -LRB- <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> -RRB- believes that story, but unfortunately the letters among <PERSON> Gluck </PERSON>'s papers do n't confirm his account,'' she told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unfortunately I have the letters from the priest in <LOCATION> Roquebrun </LOCATION> and letters from the undertakers.'' She said <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gluck </PERSON> spent years trying to convince <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>' friends the wrong bones went to <PERSON> Drumcliffe </PERSON> and that the affair needed to go into the biography because it illustrated her obsessive character

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who was charged by a federal lawsuit with insider trading, almost single-handedly built `` junk-bond'' financing into the tool of choice for corporate raiders during the past dozen years. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was seen for years as a Wall Street whiz kid, who had helped transform <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from a minor player into a powerhouse. Even when it became known several months ago that he was under investigation for insider trading, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> took the offensive. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> waged a public-relations blitz, stressing the role of junk bonds _ notes that are highly risky but offer high yields _ in helping small companies get off the ground and downplaying their role megabuck takeover battles. The normally secretive <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, 42, began accepting speaking engagements and granting some interviews _ with the condition that questions about the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the investigation of him were off limits. His comments focused almost solely on his latest pet plan _ to alleviate the <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> debt crisis by swapping debt for equity or selling securities backed by those countries' oil and silver resources. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> reportedly makes $ 40 million a year as the head of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s junk-bond operation. That is several times more than the firm's chairman. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s personal fortune has been estimated at more than $ 500 million. He lives with his children and wife, <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> _ his high school sweetheart whom he married at age 22 _ in a house on the former estate of the late actor <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> in suburban <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION>, an upper-middle-class section of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> two miles from his childhood home. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s fascination with finance dates to his boyhood. At age 10, a favorite pastime was poring over tax returns prepared by his father, an accountant. After studying business at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> went to work for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> as a junior bond trader. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> merged with <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1973 and <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brussels </PERSON> <PERSON> Witter </PERSON> in 1976, and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s job was moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> worked hard to make a name for himself but never became acclimated to the East. In 1977, he persuaded <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to let him move the company's junk-bond operations from <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, just off swank Rodeo Drive <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> became enormously successful in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, building a close-knit network of junk-bond investors. He is in charge of the 150 people who work at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s junk-bond operation. He still works 12 to 13 hours a day, seven days a week and wo n't tolerate lack of drive among those who work for him Associates say they need to make appointments to meet with him even on weekends. He once said he had no hobbies `` because what I do is fun.''

 A 63-year-old real estate agent who `` always needs money'' randomly picked numbers from the front page of a newspaper to beat the 14 million-to-1 odds for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Lotto, winning a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> record $ 55 million <PERSON> Sheelah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, 63, said Wednesday her winning six-number combination _ 3, 5, 19, 20, 27 and 35 _ was drawn from the first six numbers she saw in The Orlando Sentinel last week. She then bought her ticket near her home in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Winter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. Twice earlier, Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said she had $ 4 winners in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 8-month-old lottery Since then, she bought five tickets each week but was stunned when she watched Saturday's drawing on television and realized she was rich. `` I just kept saying ` Oh, my God!''' she told a room packed with journalists as she was introduced at the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offices. Her first call was to her lawyer. `` She told me not to leave the house,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said, calling Wednesday a day of firsts. `` Today I had my first plane ride. It is not that I'm afraid. I never had a reason to fly before,'' she said. `` This is my first press conference. And this is the first time I ever won $ 55 million.'' The prize was the largest single lottery jackpot in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. The odds of winning were estimated by lottery officials at 14 million to 1. Previously, the largest single jackpot was <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s $ 46 million that went to <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON> Sr. and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Despot </PERSON>, a couple from <LOCATION> Hollidaysburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, last October. Two individual ticket-buyers divided a $ 51.4 million <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lottery jackpot in June. Publicity from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s jackpot spurred a buying frenzy before Saturday night's drawing here and in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, lottery officials in those states said. Saturday night's prizes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> totaled $ 44 million, bringing the night's take for the three states to nearly $ 100 million. The winner of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lottery's second largest prize, $ 23 million, was a 29-year-old truck driver who also presented his ticket Wednesday, then announced his retirement, kissed his wife and forecast a rosy future. `` Right now we're just going to stick with the simple things,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>. `` Maybe a house, a couple of cars. Put money away for my son. Maybe another baby. That's about it. In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, four ticket-buyers split a $ 21 million jackpot. As of Wednesday afternoon, only one of the four had come forward. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s new winner said she did n't know if she'd keep her job or what she would buy when the state next week hands over the first installment of $ 2,767,361 _ minus 20 percent that goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. She will receive 19 other slightly smaller payments. `` I've always been middle class and the middle class always needs money,'' said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> native, who moved to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1975. `` I can buy an awful lot of things now,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, who is single, has no children but has a brother and nephews in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I'm overwhelmed.'' Before Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> claimed her prize, dozens of people claimed they had the winning ticket. One claimant, a janitor named <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, submitted a machine copy of the purported winning ticket Wednesday, saying the original had been damaged in the laundry. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s claim was enough to get him a $ 23,000 van with no cash down from a car dealer. `` We're sorry for him, but we're not too shook up about it,'' said <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, owner of a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chevrolet </LOCATION> dealership. He said he expects to get the van back. `` Maybe we'll raffle it off.''

 A difficult and sultry opera aria by Miss Oklahoma and Miss <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s `` super'' swimsuit helped win them first honors in preliminary competition at the Miss America Pageant. <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, a music student at <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> University </LOCATION>, sang what she called a `` very tough'' aria Wednesday to win the talent competition among her group of 17 first-round contestants. She won with her rendition of `` <ORGANIZATION> Una </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fa </ORGANIZATION>'' from `` The Barber of <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>,'' which the 23-year-old soprano said she's practiced for three years The <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, resident, who called her performance `` very flirtatious,'' performed in a slinky gown, overlayed with sequined patterns of gold, bronze and charcoal and a charcoal-colored feathered flounce. `` I praised God. I just left it up to him,'' Miss <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Louisiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brossett </PERSON>, a 5-foot-8, 115-pound brunette from <PERSON> West </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, took the first round swimsuit competition in her group. Swimsuit winners often go on to win the <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> title, despite continuing criticism of that part of the pageant. Miss <PERSON> Brossett </PERSON> wore a white `` supersuit'' designed by <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> pageant official, to enhance the figure. The supersuits were worn by 11 of 17 first-round competitors. The 21-year-old Miss <PERSON> Brossett </PERSON> said she hopes to become a lawyer, a job in which she said she'll draw on the poise she picks up modeling her swimsuit. `` A lawyer is the kind of person who's got to be ready for any type of situation. So, I guess I am,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> senior said. `` I am physically fit. I feel good about myself,'' she said. `` I guarantee it's going to help me when I get into that court.'' Wednesday's competition was the first of three nights of swimsuit, talent and evening gown rounds among three groups of 17 contestants each. The winners of the preliminary evening gown competitions are kept secret to heighten the suspense for the finals. In the preliminaries, talent counts for 50 percent, while the other 50 percent is divided among the swimsuit, evening gown and interview divisions. The 10 women who have accumulated the most points in preliminary competitions and interviews with the judges will become finalists competing on Saturday to succeed Miss America 1988 <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Lani </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At the advice of the nation's bishops, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> will bypass <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ the most populous and dominant country in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ when he begins a visit to the region Saturday South African Catholics have written to newspapers and their church, expressing anger and disappointment that the pope is not stopping in their land. He will visit <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>, all of which border <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Some <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> Catholics said they would withhold donations that would be used to finance the pope's visit to the poorer, neighboring countries. Others suggested the pope could have done some good by bringing a message of peace, reconciliation and respect for human rights to racially divided <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The dispute is part of a growing tension between the South African government and church leaders who actively oppose apartheid, under which the nation's black majority has no voice in national affairs. No one in the church has said that the itinerary for the Sept. 10-19 visit is a snub of the South African government or a demonstration of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s disapproval of apartheid. But the <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> government said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was protesting apartheid by not going to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. It banned South African-based foreign journalists from covering the pope in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s office issued a statement Aug. 4 saying the bishops were to blame for the pope skipping <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because they had not invited him, although they had been told the government would welcome a visit. The Southern African <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> said it invited the pope to come to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1982 but has been unable to arrange a date. The conference said it would be impractical to squeeze a large country like <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> into a tour already covering five nations. `` There has been a lot of misunderstanding about the whole thing,'' said the archbishop of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>. `` The pope never said he would n't come.'' He called <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s Aug. 4 statement `` mischievous.'' The <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in July that he would like to visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> some day but that the bishops told him it would not be appropriate at this time. He did not elaborate. South African security police this week went to the home of Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> to collect a recording of his latest sermon. They were investigating whether he had violated emergency regulations by calling for a boycott of October municipal elections. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said last week the government may `` clip the wings'' of activist clergymen who vowed to begin a civil disobedience campaign against emergency rules. The Rev. <PERSON> Smangaliso </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkhatshwa </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, was released from detention last year after church officials filed court affidavits in which he swore he was being tortured. He was subsequently charged with possession of a gun, which he denies. The schedule for the pope's 10-day visit includes beatification of a French missionary in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, a bishops' conference in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, and outdoor Masses in <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. The pope received South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in 1984 and there are plans for him to send greetings during one of his two flights over the country, on his way to <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> is surrounded by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> is bordered on three sides by its huge neighbor. Hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, black and white, are expected to cross the border to see the pope. Many thousands are also expected in <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. Just as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> dominates communications, trade, transportation and politics in the region, its influence will be felt strongly during the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s trip. South African firms are supplying transportation, food, water and health services, broadcasting and emergency equipment to be used on many of the pope's stops. Local coordinating committees are selling papal souvenirs through South African franchises, to defray the expenses of building podiums for the outdoor rallies, providing accommodations for dignitaries and pilgrims, and arranging for security and traffic control.

 Rivers across this flooded nation receded slightly today, but the change brought little relief to people still boating and wading through murky waters to get food and uncontaminated water. The death toll from the floods that started June 13 and subsided only to rise with new vengeance on Aug. 27 was 416 according to the government, whose count is generally considered low. The independent Bengali-language newspaper Khobar today reported 34 new drownings and snake-bite deaths, bringing the unofficial toll to 1,301. The Buriganga and Sitlakhya rivers that wrap around <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> on three sides fell between 1 -LCB- to 4 inches in the last 24 hours but were still as much as 45 inches above flood level, the flood control center reported. About three-fourths of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, an impoverished low-lying nation of 110 million people, remained under water ranging from a few inches in some areas to at least 10 feet in others. In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, a city of 6 million, streets were turned into canals clogged with boats ferrying people to work, to food markets and relief centers and to spigots to get drinking water. At least half the capital was still under water. In the <LOCATION> Shaymoli </LOCATION> neighborhood in northern <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, two young seamstresses waded waist deep in front of the four-story building that houses the small Fairy Fashion Factory where they work. `` Eleven of us are living in the factory because our homes are flooded,'' said 20-year-old <PERSON> Shamima </PERSON>, who uses only one name. `` There has been no electricity for two weeks, so we ca n't work and we do n't know if we'll be paid, but the owner is bringing us food.'' She and her friend, 17-year-old <PERSON> Lily </PERSON>, said they waded through the flood each day to buy about five gallons of drinking water for 31 cents. They said the water proably was n't pure, but it was all they could get. `` Most of us have fevers and headaches,'' <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> said. Both young women said they had heard about water purification tablets but were n't using any. `` No one has given us any, and we do n't have enough money to buy any,'' <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> said. The government says it is distributing water purification tablets throughout the country, but they are in short supply. A diplomat from a Western nation that has been trying to buy water tablets for relief distribution reported searching in vain for sufficient quantities in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and nearby countries. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity. Of more than two dozen people questioned at random in <LOCATION> Shaymoli </LOCATION>, only one man _ a pharmacy shopkeeper _ said he was using them. The government's health control center reported 16,813 new cases of diarrhea Wednesday, bringing the total of known cases across the country to 119,822 since Aug. 27. At least 83 of the afflicted people died, and their deaths were included in the government's toll of flood victims The government says at least 25 million people have lost their homes in the flooding. Relief camps have been set up in an effort to help people whose homes were washed away or are filled with flood water, but many other people have moved in with relatives, living on rooftops or camping in makeshift shelters on bits of high ground. <PERSON> Abul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashem </PERSON>, a 50-year-old auto mechanic, has been living for the past two weeks on the roof of a corrugated tin shed in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. He said he tried to find other shelter but relief centers where he went were full. He and nine other men and boys pitched tents on the roof of sheds facing their homes. `` I could n't leave my things,'' he said, pointing to his own tin house where the water reached nearly to the roof. `` There is nothing important there, but whatever I have is mine and I'm afraid of robbers.'' <PERSON> Abul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashem </PERSON> and others in the neighborhood said robbers came at night in motorboats and looted abandoned houses and businesses. <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers also have reported that robbers were operating from boats, but the government denied there had been an increase in break-ins. Home Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Matin </PERSON> said the number of thefts had not increased, and the only difference was that thieves were now coming by boat instead of land.

 Soviet and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eskimos </ORGANIZATION> embraced and chatted excitedly in their native language as a delegation from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> arrived in this historic gold-mining town to resume ties broken 40 years ago. The Soviets arrived Wednesday aboard the hydrological research ship <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Laptev </PERSON>, which left the Soviet coastal town of <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION> 24 hours earlier for a goodwill trip intended to build new economic and cultural contacts between the superpowers' most remote regions. `` Not only do you resemble the people of <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION>, you act like them,'' Provideniya Mayor <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulinkin </PERSON> said at a luncheon, praising <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> for its hospitality. `` I arrived, it's just like home. In the first minutes there was the land, grass, the weather, and most important, friends,'' he said. The visit by the 11-member Soviet delegation and a crowd of Soviet and foreign journalists came in response to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` friendship flight'' in June, when Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> led 82 <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eskimos </ORGANIZATION>, politicians and journalists to <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION>. Immediately after the Soviets debarked from tugboat here, one Soviet Eskimo, <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Nanok </PERSON>, spotted distant relatives he first met in June. Members of the group embraced and talked excitedly in their native language. Several minutes later, they were inside a store souvenir hunting. One Nome radio station broadcast an elementary Russian language lesson. Officials of both sides said they not only hope to allow regular contacts among Eskimos, who had been cut off from relatives on opposite sides of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> since 1948. They want to establish ties that will mean increased trade, tourism and scientific cooperation. `` If you have relatives, you can not help but know this will turn out well,'' said <PERSON> Nadezhda </PERSON> <PERSON> Otke </PERSON>, a member of Presidium of the upreme Soviet, the country's highest executive body. `` This will help achieve peace on the entire planet.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> businessman who began efforts to improve relations across the strait 2 -LCB- years ago, said he hoped that `` maybe some day our common border will be guarded by friendship alone.'' The Soviet delegation flew to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> later, and were greeted at the airport by <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>. They will be in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s largest city for a day before returning to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> and then back across the strait. Under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is seeking to form joint ventures with Western companies to help modernize the sluggish Soviet economy. Like <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is a region rich in minerals, but harsh and sparsely populated.

 <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>'s country-mile victory in the first <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup race reduced the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> challenger yacht to a ship of fools, says the tactician for the loser. `` We go out on the track and we're treated like fools, because we go out there and we sail around the track as fast as we could in our boat and we have a boat ahead of us making a mockery of the race,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s tactician and alternate helmsman. `` I must say I have lost a lot of respect for the <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stripes organization,'' <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> said at an acrimonious Wednesday night news conference, shortly after <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>'s 60-foot, dual-hulled catamaran breezed to an 18-minute, 15-second victory over the <ORGANIZATION> Kiwis </ORGANIZATION>' monohull challenger in the opening of a best-of-three series. The next race is scheduled for Friday. If <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> were to win, the deciding race would be Sunday. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> skipper <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Farr </PERSON>, designer of the 133-foot challenger, claimed <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, held back his arrow-hulled flier by deliberately sailing the <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stripes catamaran below its potential over the 40-mile windward-leeward course. They contended the catamaran should have beaten them by an hour or more had it been sailed to its potential. Asked if he `` dogged it,'' <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> replied, `` I'm sailing a cat. Somebody else is sailing a dog.''

<HEAD>WYOMING:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Fire gutted 17 buildings at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>'s Old Faithful geyser complex Wednesday. About 200 firefighters protected other structures, including the historic Old Faithful Inn. Overnight visitors to Old Faithful were asked to leave Wednesday morning in the first-ever evacuation of the most popular tourist attraction at the 116-year-old park. The nearby 165,000-acre North Fork fire is one of 13 major blazes covering more than 1 million acres in and around <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. East of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> officials evacuated at least 50 ranches and summer homes in a sparsely populated area because of rapid growth of the 260,000-acre Clover Mist fire.

<HEAD>MONTANA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Two men were reported missing west of <LOCATION> Glacier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> early today as flames raced near their remote home. The blaze, discovered Tuesday, expanded to an estimated 7,500 acres by early today and moved into the park. There it burned a ranger station complex and numerous cabins. Four hikers in the park were rescued by helicopter Wednesday after flames cut off their escape route. More than 100 people were evacuated because of the blaze, and two park campgrounds were evacuated and closed. Along Yellowstone's northern border, high winds drove a deliberately set backfire along the northern edge of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and nearby Silver Gate. The fire singed the fringes of the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> towns but created a buffer zone of charred timber in advance of the 119,000-acre Storm Creek-Hellroaring fire. Elsewhere, winds sent wildfires boiling through timber in the <LOCATION> Bitterroot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> line, northeast of <PERSON> Ovando </PERSON> along the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Divide </ORGANIZATION>, and in a wide area to the north and south of <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> along the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Dozens of people were evacuated from homes in the paths of the blazes.

<HEAD>IDAHO:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A number of fires in the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Church-River </PERSON> of No Return Wilderness reached nearly 60,000 acres. To the north, seven fires continued to burn out of control in the <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, covering nearly 89,000 acres.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WASHINGTON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Prime fruit orchards were spared from a raging forest fire in central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state by farmers turning on their irrigation systems, by a shift in winds and by cooler weather. The dampened apple and pear orchards near the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Entiat </LOCATION> helped keep the spreading 32,000-acre fire from all but one home, which was destroyed. About 700 firefighters used bulldozers in an attempt to ring the fire, while aircraft and helicopters bombed it with water and flame retardant. The fire is the largest of a half-dozen in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that burned 65,000 acres.

<HEAD>OREGON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Firefighters declared the lightning-caused Teepee Butte fire in northeastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> under control after it burned nearly 60,000 acres of the <ORGANIZATION> Wallowa-Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and the Hell's <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> over the past two weeks.

 Exiled Soviet writer <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> has rejected an invitation to join an official Soviet committee building a monument to the victims of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s rule, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The reclusive writer sent a telegram to the monument's organizing committee on Tuesday declining to join, the newspaper said <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s masterwork, `` The Gulag Archipelago,'' traces the history of political repression in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and dwells at length on the purges and widespread repression during <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s 29-year reign The writer, who spent eight years in labor camps under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, was expelled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after the publication of the `` Gulag'' trilogy in the West. The 1970 Nobel laureate lives in <LOCATION> Cavendish </LOCATION>, Vt. The Times said that according to the writer's wife, <PERSON> Natalya </PERSON>, the cable said: `` To the memory of those who perished in 1918-1956, I have dedicated ` Gulag Archipelago,' for which I was rewarded with the accusation of treason. It is not possible to pass over this. Moreover, since I am located outside the country, there is no possibility of actually participating in its civic life.'' The range of time <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> mentioned dates to the years of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, who is still venerated in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. On Friday, one of the project's organizers, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Samadunov </PERSON>, said the invitation did not necessarily mean an easing in official attitudes toward <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, but was due to the number of Soviet citizens who think the dissident writer is among those best qualified to serve on the committee. Under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and his legacy have come in for increasingly severe criticism. In July, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> approved the building of a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> monument to his victims. On Aug. 25, a public council was formed to supervise the construction and maintenance of the monument, as was an executive committee to submit a blueprint for its design. <PERSON> Samadunov </PERSON>, who is on the executive committee, said the members of the public council were chosen in street polls and from names submitted by readers to state-run publications.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of policemen aided by dogs searched villages in northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> today for 10 Sikh extremists who raided a train, murdered 10 passengers and wounded 13 others, police said. The militants, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, surrounded the train carrying 450 passengers at <LOCATION> Rureassal </LOCATION> railway station Wednesday and killed eight Hindus and two Sikh passengers, police chief <PERSON> Sanjiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> said. The train was on a 45-mile journey from the Sikh holy city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Khemkaran </LOCATION>, the last Indian railhead before the frontier with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. All the victims were commuters who come to <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> daily to work. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agencies reported 12 people died in the attack. But police confirmed only 10 deaths. Witnesses said the killers waited for the train to arrive at the station at <LOCATION> Rureassal </LOCATION>, where it makes a brief stop. `` As soon as the train stopped, we heard some people shouting, ` Kill them, kill them,''' said <PERSON> Mansa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ram </PERSON>, a passenger who escaped with bullet wounds on his legs. `` They first surrounded the train and fired from outside to stop passengers from escaping ... After few minutes they boarded the last car and killed the passengers,'' Ram, a Hindu farm worker, said in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. The killers fled after they were challenged by 10 policemen on board the train, <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bali </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, another witness, said the killers separated Hindu passengers from Sikhs in the last car and killed eight Hindus by firing at point-blank range. Two Sikh passengers died later after being caught in cross fire between the extremists and security forces. `` There were 35 passengers in the last car, about half Hindus. We all could have been dead, had the security forces not come in our rescue,'' said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a Hindu. Under government order, trains in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> carry security forces to thwart possible Sikh terrorist attacks. Militant Sikhs have been fighting since 1982 for a separate homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. More than 1,850 people have died this year in violence blamed on the militants. Sikhs, who make up 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people, allege they are discriminated against by <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON>, who comprise about 80 percent of the population. Sikhs are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Teacher Walkouts Affect Schools In Five States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 About 7,000 striking teachers, many of them demanding bigger pay raises, continued to disrupt classes for 110,000 students in six states today. Some students returned to school Wednesday in two districts in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> as teachers reached agreements on contracts, but strikes continued elsewhere in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` We do n't want to strike but we are forced to strike. Veteran teachers earn less than rookie police and firemen. Why?'' said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, teacher <PERSON> Coe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kevghas </PERSON> as he picketed in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday. In the <LOCATION> Cheltenham </LOCATION> district in suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, about 4,000 students missed their opening day of school today because of a walkout by 325 teachers seeking a top salary of $ 61,251. The district has offered a maximum of $ 60,000. Including Cheltenham, strikes by 2,700 teachers in 10 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> districts are keeping 43,800 students out of classrooms. Officials in southwest <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s Vermilion Parish agreed Tuesday night to collective bargaining with the <ORGANIZATION> Vermilion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educators </ORGANIZATION> representing 600 teachers, cafeteria workers and school bus drivers, ending a three-week strike. And in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, teachers in <PERSON> Fenton </PERSON> ended a one-day walkout affecting 2,800 students pending ratification of a three-year contract. Terms were unavailable. Elsewhere in the state, walkouts continued in at least nine public school districts, affecting more than 42,000 students and 2,200 teachers. Talks were scheduled to resume today for more than 1,400 professors and academic staff members at <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, who went on strike Tuesday over union work rules and salary. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, where teacher strikes are illegal, classes remained canceled today in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Peabody </PERSON> as walkouts entered their second day. Peabody's 408 teachers on Tuesday rejected a 17 percent wage increase over three years, holding out for 42 percent. `` To sit at the table locked in at 42 percent is totally irresponsible,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Torigian </PERSON>. He called a `` teachers' day'' for today so educators could prepare for classes Friday, but <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON> said the teachers planned to continue walking the picket line <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>'s 970 teachers voted unanimously Tuesday to stay off the job, a move that affected 13,100 students. The teachers are holding out for raises of 25 percent over three years compared with an offer of 15 percent over two years. The state <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday declared <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION>'s strike illegal and ordered teachers back to work, and a hearing was set for today to determine if the strike by <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> teachers is illegal. The move is a routine step designed to set the contract negotiation process in motion. Around <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, teachers in 35 communities were still without contracts Wednesday as classes began. In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 60 substitutes replaced striking teachers in <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, allowing schools to open. Negotiators for the teachers and the school board plan to meet tonight and union President <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Swigart </PERSON> said `` the two sides are very close on a salary schedule for a three-year agreement.'' Negotiators in <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> headed for the bargaining table in the state's only other teachers' strike. Granite City's 444 teachers walked off their jobs Tuesday, idling 8,200 students in the district's 12 schools, which have been open since Aug. 25. Teachers have rejected a 4 percent pay raise and are asking for a two-year contract with salary increases of 10 percent each year, Superintendent <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walmsley </PERSON> said. Classes for 1,450 students at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Voorhees </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, were canceled for the second straight day today because of a strike by about 130 teachers, custodians and clerks, despite a judge's order Wednesday that workers return to school or face possible jail sentences. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, contract talks involving 357 striking teachers and support personnel at five <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> schools serving 1,250 handicapped students will resume at the end of the week, school and union officials said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Study: Eye Dominance Important in Baseball Skills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Baseball coaches looking for a strategic edge might want to consider whether their players are left-eyed or right-eyed, a report published today suggests. Just as people prefer to use one hand over the other, they tend to see from one eye more than the other. If people are both right-handed and right-eyed, they are said to have uncrossed eye-hand dominance. But if the favored hand and eye do n't match, they have crossed dominance. In a letter in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, Drs. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Portal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> described their study of eye dominance in baseball. The researchers gave eye tests to ordinary people and found that two-thirds had uncrossed eye-hand dominance. The rest were evenly split between those with crossed dominance and those who used both eyes equally. However, they found that members of the university's baseball team were twice as likely to have crossed dominance and 50 percent more likely to use their eyes equally. `` We think crossed dominance may aid the batter,'' the doctors wrote. They found that players with crossed dominance had batting averages of .310, compared with .250 for those with uncrossed dominance. However, those who saw equally from both eyes had the best average at .340. `` Since left-handers more frequently have crossed dominance than right-handers,'' they wrote, `` crossed dominance may also help to explain the relative preponderance of left-handers in professional baseball.'' While players with uncrossed dominance are worse hitters, they also tend to be better pitchers. `` Uncrossed dominance may therefore be a relative handicap to hitting, forcing those who have it to become pitchers, or it may be an aid to pitching,'' they wrote. The researchers cautioned that people should not try to change their dominant eye, because this can cause permanent double vision and other eye problems. And vision dominance may be inherited, anyway. However, they said that if confirmed, their findings might be used to guide young athletes into the sports specialties that they are best suited for. `` More specifically,'' they wrote, `` since batters with crossed dominance seem most successful, they could try a crossed-dominant stance: If right-eyed, bat left-handed, and if left-eyed, bat right-handed.''

<TEXT>
 A former state administrator escaped bribery charges by pleading guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with a failed attempt to sell potatoes to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> that rocked state politics. `` It is time to put our lives back together,'' said <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> McMerty </PERSON>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s former marketing director. `` It has been an awfully emotionally draining affair for my family.'' The state agreed to drop bribery charges against McMerty after he pleaded guilty Wednesday to unlawful compensation for assistance in a government matter. He faces up to one year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. No date for sentencing was set. McMerty, 43, admitted taking $ 3,200 in cash from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, a Miami-based middleman in the botched 1986 deal involving the sale of 4 million pounds of potato seed to a <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> cooperative. McMerty claimed the money was reimbursement for expenses. The former administrator had been accused of accepting a <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> cruise and up to $ 4,000 in cash from <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, and jury selection for a bribery trial had started in state district court Wednesday morning before McMerty agreed to the misdemeanor plea. The bribery charges carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. `` I am confident and comfortable justice has been served,'' Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Quick </PERSON> said of the plea arrangement. The bribery charges were based almost entirely on circumstantial evidence, Quick said. Some evidence would have indicated McMerty was `` duped by <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, at least partially,'' he said. `` I characterize this case as one of criminal bad judgment.'' The case is credited with ruining the political career of Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a Republican who was denied endorsement for a third term because of the lingering scandal. The <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> deal collapsed after Attorney General <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> raised questions about its financing, and the state has never been paid $ 104,000 due for the only 400,000-pound potato shipment that was delivered. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> became embroiled in the controversy when he and the former president of the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> signed a $ 300,000 note meant to help finance the deal. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> later sold the note to a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> bank for $ 264,000, putting $ 180,000 of the money in his personal bank account to cover overdrafts, the state has said. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> pleaded guilty July 8 to bribery as part of a plea agreement that requires him to pay $ 60,888 in restitution to the state. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, who was placed on probation, was in jail for six months prior to the plea.

<HEAD>Study Shows Encephalitis Vaccine Is Effective</HEAD>

 A vaccine is highly effective against an epidemic form of encephalitis that is a major health problem among children in parts of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, according to a report published today. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> study tested a vaccine used to control the Japanese encephalitis virus. Although its primary victims are school-age children, the virus also affects travelers and military personnel. Encephalitis vaccine has been administered to millions of children in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> since the 1960s, but the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> study was the first to test the effectiveness of the most widely used versions of the vaccine. At $ 2.30 per dose the vaccine is relatively expensive, and Japanese encephalitis is still a major health hazard in many parts of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The study was conducted on 65,224 children in northern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, where the disease strikes 10 to 20 of every 100,000 people. This rate is similar to polio at its worst in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. According to a report in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, two-thirds of youngsters received two doses of vaccine, while the rest got dummy shots. The attack rate was 5 per 100,000 in those getting vaccine and 51 per 100,000 in the comparison group. The study directed by Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoke </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> concludes that the vaccine is safe and effective. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Monath </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> noted that the vaccine is not available to Americans abroad because of its manufacturer's concerns about liability However, he said efforts are under way to resolve this issue, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing applications to sell the vaccine in this country.

<HEAD>Study Finds No Link Between Whooping Cough Vaccine and Crib Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Babies who are vaccinated against whooping cough face no unusual risk of crib death, as some experts had feared, according to a major study published today. The report was based on a review of 129,834 vaccinated babies. It found that the risk of crib death is actually lower than usual after the shots. Some research has suggested that babies have an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, immediately after receiving immunization for whopping cough, also known as pertussis. Babies are routinely given the so-called DTP vaccine, which protects them from diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. The study by Dr. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> finds no support for this concern. `` We conclude in this large population of children there was no increase in the risk of SIDS after immunization with the DTP vaccine,'' they wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. Doctors generally recommend that children receive five doses of the vaccine _ three during the first six months, one after the first birthday and one before starting school. Crib death is considered to be the sudden, unexpected death of an infant or young child when no specific cause of death can be found. It is most common before the first birthday, accounting for 30 percent of all deaths in the age group. The study was based on children born between 1974 and 1984 in four <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> counties. The researchers compared the risk of SIDS deaths during the first month after vaccination with the risk later in infancy. They found that that during the first week after vaccination, the risk was less than 20 percent that of later periods. `` The most plausible explanation for the decreased rate of SIDS in the period immediately after immunization is that children may be immunized when they are in better health and that this healthier state is associated with a lower risk of SIDS,'' they wrote.

 Soviet scientists are having trouble communicating with an unmanned spacecraft, and the problem is jeopardizing a joint U.S.-Soviet study of the sun planned for this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The extent of the problem is unknown but the plan to use the spacecraft, <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 1, in the solar study is considered to be in jeopardy, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has been informed `` that they are having a problem communicating'' with the spacecraft, said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amorose </PERSON> of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. The Soviets have not asked for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance, he added. <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 1, launched July 7 as part of a major Soviet study of Mars and its moons, was to have worked with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Solar Maximum spacecraft, which has been orbiting Earth for almost a decade, to study the sun. The two spacecraft were to view the sun at the same time from different angles, providing the first stereoscopic images of the sun.

 The dollar inched up on <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> markets today after closing slightly down in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in what dealers said were technical fluctuations anticipating the next batch of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic data. Gold improved. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.10 yen to a closing 134.20. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 133.80 yen. `` It seems that the dollar has hit its lowest level,'' said a dealer with the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Some institutional investors have already started buying more dollars.'' But a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> said: `` Investors were less concerned about worldwide higher discount rates and inflation. They're now starting to think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' economy is not doing that well, considering the decline of petroleum prices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, dealers said markets were following the currency charts and looking ahead to Friday's release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Producer Price Index for August and next week's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> current account balance and trade deficit for July. `` There are now more bullish considerations in the market,'' said a dealer in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` The feeling is that inflation is coming up again.'' A <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> trader forecast the dollar would stay between 1.84 and 1.85 West German marks until next week. Another said fears of central bank intervention would hold dollar below 1.86. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Wednesday: _ 1.8498 West German marks, up from 1.8435 _ 1.5615 Swiss francs, up from 1.5545 _ 6.3040 French francs, up from 6.2795 _ 2.0852 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0810 _ 1,383.25 Italian lire, up from 1,376.50 _ 1.2388 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2392 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.6980, Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 427.15 a troy ounce, up from $ 426.70 bid late Wednesday. At mid-morning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 428.00 `` We're still entrenched in a range between $ 425 and $ 430,'' said a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> bullion dealer. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 428.15, up from $ 427.50 bid late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 0.32 to close at a bid $ 430.51.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Trustee Concerned About Bakker's Prospects Of Buying
PTL</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> middleman arranging overseas financing for <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s $ 172 million bid to buy back <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> has been convicted of fraud and has a long criminal record, a television station reported. The report Wednesday night by <ORGANIZATION> WBTV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> comes on the eve of deadlines today and Friday for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, the leading bidder for the embattled ministry's assets, to prove he can carry through on his offer. `` -LRB- There's -RRB- one complication after another, sort of like a soap opera,'' M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy trustee, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he was concerned over the report that <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pihakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was convicted of fraud and has an extensive criminal record. <PERSON> Pihakis </PERSON> has been coordinating arrangements with unidentified Greek businessmen planning to back <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s bid, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he would meet with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> today. `` I want to find out how he feels this will affect his deal ... -LRB- and hear -RRB- just what his alternatives are,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s attorney in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Pihakis </PERSON> should not become the issue in <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s bid. `` There's no scam here. There's no payment to him. There's nothing we're risking'' on <PERSON> Pihakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pihakis </PERSON> has `` never been the man with the money,'' <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said. Asked whether <PERSON> Pihakis </PERSON>' criminal record casts doubt on the legitimacy of the transaction, <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said Wednesday, `` The only way to tell is to see if the money is there.'' Earlier this week, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> extended from Tuesday until today a deadline for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to present a $ 3 million downpayment on his offer and set Friday as a deadline for contractual arrangements to be worked out. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said Tuesday he needed only $ 100,000 more to reach the $ 3 million, but <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said Wednesday night he did not know where <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s total stood. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> faces a Saturday deadline to recommend a buyer for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> The assets include <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s Christian theme park, satellite television network and undeveloped property near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> Also Wednesday, Canadian businessman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> formally withdrew his $ 113 million offer for the ministry's assets, but asked <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> to reopen the bidding. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987, after admitting having a sexual encounter with church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code three months later. <ORGANIZATION> WBTV </ORGANIZATION> said that from 1970 through 1981, <PERSON> Pihakis </PERSON>, who runs <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultants </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, was arrested or served time for charges including fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy, forgery, counterfeiting and parole violations. The station did not say where it got its information. The report said <PERSON> Pihakis </PERSON> admitted to the station that he served eight months in jail during that time on charges he said were trumped-up. <PERSON> Pihakis </PERSON>' home telephone number is unlisted and he could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone invterview Wednesday night that neither <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> nor his lawyers knew the identity of the Greek businessmen. He said they are relying on the word of longtime <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> friend and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, who led <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Pihakis </LOCATION> and has acted as a middleman between them. <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> described <PERSON> Pihakis </PERSON> as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative for the Greek businessmen. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, who declined to say what his business is but was identified by <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> as a songwriter, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> that he was aware that <PERSON> Pihakis </PERSON> had a criminal record, but he did not know how extensive it was. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said he has had verification, which did not come through <PERSON> Pihakis </PERSON>, that the Greek financing is forthcoming. As long as adverse publicity about <PERSON> Pihakis </PERSON> does not scare away a <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> bank that has agreed to handle the Greek funds, the deal should go through in a matter of days, <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said.

 Here is a summary of natural disasters that have hit <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> since June: FLOODS: Aug. 27 _ Floods triggered by annual monsoons claim at least 416 lives in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and leave more than 21 million people homeless. Newspapers claim more than 1,200 people are killed. At one time, three-fourths of the impoverished nation is under water. Because wells and pumps are submerged, people begin drinking flood water, prompting a rise in diarrhea cases. EARTHQUAKES: Aug. 20 _ An earthquake registering 6.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale jolts the Himalayan mountains, foothills and plains of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. It is the deadliest temblor in the region in 30 years. At least 714 people are killed in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and 281 in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The official tolls are considered understated because the monsoons cut off roads to many remote villages. Tens of thousands of homes, mostly of brick and mud, are destroyed. Aug. 6 _ An earthquake measuring 7.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale shakes <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Four people die in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. STORMS: Aug. 16 _ A storm kills 1,406 people and causes $ 1.2 billion in damage to the central Chinese province of <LOCATION> Shaanxi </LOCATION>. It also triggers mountain torrents that destroy 3,000 homes, 14,326 acres of farmland and washes away 165 miles of highway. Officials call it the most destructive storm in the country's history. Sept. 2 _ Landslides caused by torrential rains kill at least 35 people in various parts of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. HEAT: June 4 _ Northern and central <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> swelter in the worst heat in 20 years, with temperatures climbing as high as 117 degrees for nearly three weeks. The government says at least 450 people died, most in the desert state of <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION>.

Appearing before the board on his 41st birthday, <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON> said that living as a fugitive while running a business and raising a family `` inflicted more punishment on myself than the state of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> could possibly have done.'' `` That's one of the things that has kept eating at my insides,'' he said. `` I'd be watching a ball game and the police would drive by or somebody would pull up in the driveway. My stomach would tie up in a knot.'' His life as <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillette </PERSON>, an auto repair shop owner who enjoyed a reputation as a hard-working, law-abiding family man, ended on Feb. 5 when <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested him at his business in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, had asked the board to recommend a pardon or a commutation of the remainder of the sentence. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> told the board that petitions bearing the names of 2,000 <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> residents asking that <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON> be pardoned had been sent to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> authorities. `` There was a <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON> who killed a man 20 years ago and escaped,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` Then there's a <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillette </PERSON>. ... It's almost like they're two separate people. In 1970, <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON> escaped from the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Correctional and <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in DeQuincy where he was serving time for the shooting death of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballas </PERSON>, a nightclub bouncer in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allen </LOCATION>. `` I can not undo what happened the night of Dec. 3, 1969, and I must live with that nightmare the rest of my life,'' <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON> told the board. He said he remembered almost nothing of the killing, blaming it on alcoholism that developed while he served in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the 1960s. `` I can live with it,'' <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON> said of the board's decision. `` My family can live with it ... not much compared to 15 years.'' The decision, announced by <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> after a three-hour hearing and another three hours of deliberations by the panel, brought sobs and tears from <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON>' wife and mother `` I've got to get home. I've got to see my kids,'' <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON> told reporters. His wife, <PERSON> Bridget </PERSON>, has said she knew nothing of her husband's past before his arrest. <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON> was allowed to remain free on $ 3,500 bond pending resolution of the case. Authorities in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, where the killing took place, opposed the clemency application but no one appeared at the hearing to ask that <PERSON> Staggs </PERSON>' request be denied. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said no family members of the victim had been located.

<HEAD>Transcript Reveals Crew Knew Jet Was In Trouble</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The captain of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 exclaimed `` We're not going to make it! 11 seconds before the jet crashed upon takeoff, a partial transcript of the cockpit voice recording shows. The pilots discovered their aircraft was in serious trouble about 21 seconds before the plane struck the ground, the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The plane crashed at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> Worth International Airport Aug. 31 while taking off on a flight for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 exploded and broke apart upon impact, killing 13 of the 108 people on board. The pilots were injured but survived. The partial transcript, obtained Wednesday by the newspaper, shows that approximately nine seconds after what appeared to be a normal takeoff, a cockpit alarm indicated the jet was not able to gather enough speed to stay aloft. A second later, Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said, `` Something's wrong. Ohhh.'' One of the final entries on the transcript appears to be a scream. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators said last week that the cockpit recording indicates there were two compressor stalls, or disruptions of air flow, one each in two of the engines. The transcript, however, notes five possible compressor stalls within six seconds, a set of two followed within seconds by three more, the newspaper reported. After the first two stalls were noted, co-pilot <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said, `` Engine failure.'' Just after the three possible stalls were noted, someone in the cockpit said, `` We got an engine failure.'' Three seconds later, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said, `` We're not gon na make it.'' At that point, someone attempted to communicate something to the tower, saying only, `` Eleven-forty one's ...'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> then exclaimed, `` Full power!'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> followed with unintelligible words just a fraction of a second before what is believed to be the sound of impact is heard on the recording. The recording then ends with a possible scream. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators say they have not been able to determine whether any compressor stalls actually occurred. The engines are to be tested at the <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. One <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator, who asked not to be named, told the newspaper it is possible for engines to experience several quick, successive stalls <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> board, said, `` I do n't know that we can even identify that there were indeed stalls. The significance of the stalls, and more importantly what caused them, is the key element in the investigation into the cause of the crash. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> declined in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to comment on the partial transcript obtained by the newspaper. It will be months before investigators pinpoint the cause of the crash, but two primary suspects have emerged. They are wing flaps, desinged to give the plane lift, and engine problems during the flight. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> reported that friends of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he told them the plane suffered an engine failure. One friend, <PERSON> M.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, quoted the pilot as saying: `` I had an engine failure. I put the throttle forward and it would n't fly.'' The transcript reveals that flight engineer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> and co-pilot <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> went through a standard preparation checklist. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> told <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> that the flaps were extended in the correct position for normal takeoff during the checklist less than a minute before the plane received permission for takeoff. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is recuperating in hospital from back and head injuries suffered in the crash and has not spoken with <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators yet. He underwent surgery Tuesday to repair compound fractures in his cheekbone and has been fitted with a back brace for a broken vertebra, said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pate </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> has told the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> he does not remember the crash. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> has been interviewed by <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators. Both men were treated and released from hospitals for minor injuries.

<HEAD>Man Offers Cocaine, Stolen Clothes To Bail Out Girlfriend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man trying to get his girlfriend out of jail ended up behind bars himself after trying to use cocaine and stolen clothing as collateral for her bail, authorities said. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> High </PERSON>, 33, of <ORGANIZATION> Elon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, was charged with drug offenses and possession of stolen property after a meeting with bail bondsman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, police said. High's girlfriend, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Swann </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, had been charged with shoplifting $ 400 worth of dresses from a department store. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said High called him Sunday about posting Ms. <PERSON> Swann </PERSON>'s $ 1,000 bond. When asked about possible collateral, <PERSON> High </PERSON> took the bondsman to a car and opened the trunk, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. Inside were about a dozen dresses, the price tags still attached. `` He told me they stole them from <PERSON> Belk </PERSON>'s,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` I told him I do n't know anything about clothes. I'll take TVs, cars, but I do n't know clothes.'' High then produced a foil of white powder from inside the car, claiming it contained high-grade cocaine, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. The bondsman protested that he knew nothing about cocaine, either, and would have to get his friend <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> to vouch for the value of the loot. High lent him a quarter to make the call. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> _ Detective <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Spagnola </PERSON> _ said, `` As he held up the last piece, I put the handcuffs on him.'' Magistrate <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hohenwarter </PERSON> set bail at $ 10,000, explaining that the sum worked out to $ 1,000 for each charge and $ 7,000 `` for being so stupid,'' according to <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. Neither High nor Ms. <PERSON> Swann </PERSON> posted bail. `` I do n't know how we kept a straight face through the whole thing,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> added. Afterward, `` even the guy being arrested was laughing about it.'' `` We did give him his quarter back,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said.

 A contractor who accidentally drove a piling into underground power cables while putting in a sidewalk caused the 4 -LCB- - day blackout downtown, the utility says The contractor had asked for plans showing where the cables were, but the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> maps did n't show the service line that was hit, said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Garman </PERSON>, assistant superintendent of the city-owned utility.

At the time the line was installed, he added, `` officials did n't have the data fetish they have now.'' Utility engineers are double-checking the accuracy of other maps, he said. The piling struck a live wire and touched off the short circuit that sparked the Aug. 31 fire in an underground vault and the 50-block blackout, <PERSON> Garman </PERSON> said. The fire heavily damaged five of the six feeder cables that serve the area. Hundreds of buildings were without power through much of the Labor Day weekend.

<HEAD>Couple Sues Hospital for Allegedly Giving Them The Wrong Infant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A couple have charged in a lawsuit that a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> hospital exchanged their healthy baby for a congenitally ill one a decade ago to facilitate an adoption. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> said blood tests and sophisticated tissue-testing at a <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> immunogenetics laboratory in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> prove that the child they raised for nearly 10 years was not theirs. The child, <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON>, died of a congenital heart illness in August. The Twiggs on Wednesday filed a $ 100 million suit against <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, three physicians and a nurse, accusing them of fraud and negligence. The suit charges that the defendants swapped ID bracelets and altered hospital records to exchange the babies. Dr. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, a family physician from <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION> who was named in the suit, said Wednesday, `` I certainly would n't switch babies on anyone, but I guess you can be sued by anyone.'' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON>, hospital administrator, said he had no knowledge of the suit and was surprised by the allegations. In papers filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, the couple alleges that hospital records show their daughter was born healthy in 1978 with O-positive blood. But before leaving the hospital, Mrs. <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON> said the child was diagnosed as having a severe heart defect that proved fatal. Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> said she recalls a nurse telling her that another woman had given birth at the hospital the same day and intended to offer the child for adoption. `` What else could this be except for a case involving a payment for delivery of a healthy child as opposed to a baby with a birth defect?'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON>, the couple's lawyer. `` We're totally devastated,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON>, who lives with her husband and seven surviving children in <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` Our lives have turned into a nightmare. We've not only lost our Arlena ... but also where is our own daughter? We're very much interested in tracking down our own child.'' The <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON> said that when <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> was admitted to a hospital earlier this year, pre-operative tests showed that her blood type was B-positive, which would be almost impossible if she were the child of the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON>, both type O. More sophisticated tissue-matching tests concluded that the child was unrelated to the couple, said <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Wilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Bias </PERSON>, who performed the test, declined comment.

 Republican Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> has triggered a controversy in a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressional race by saying that a woman candidate should not be running because she has two small children. About two dozen supporters of <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamposi </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> outside the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday and characterized his remarks, made in an interview in Wednesday's The Union Leader of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, as silly, insulting and irresponsible. Mrs. <PERSON> Tamposi </PERSON>, a millionaire officer in her father's real estate company, is married and has two daughters, ages 22 months and 4. They are cared for by a nanny. State Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Freese </PERSON> said <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> `` should be apologizing to <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamposi </PERSON> for such remarks. They are below-the-belt comments and a personal attack on <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>'s credibility and excellent reputation.'' `` I do n't retract a word of it,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. `` It's self-evident that you can not work 12 to 14 hours a day in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and have time left over for a child. `` It's difficult enough being a father of a young child and a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as I am,'' said <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, who has a 3-year-old son. `` For the mother, who in our society is the primary care giver, working 10-12 hours a day makes it impossible to give the nurturing the child would need.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumont </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Tamposi </PERSON> aide, laid the blame on <PERSON> Tamposi </PERSON>'s rival, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses plan to increase capital spending by 11.6 percent this year, a fivefold increase over 1987, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the increase, if realized, would be the biggest advance since 1984, when spending shot up 16.6 percent as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry recovered from the steep 1981-82 recession. The advance would push business investment to expand and modernize production facilities up to a record high of $ 429.4 billion, after adjusting for the effects of inflation. The boom in capital investment this year has been one of the main forces driving the economic expansion as businesses have stepped up investment plans in response to heavy demand. The demand is coming in large part from a rebound in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports as a decline in the dollar since 1985 has helped manufacturers regain lost overseas markets. The latest estimate of business investment plans is based on an industry survey conducted over the last two months. It represented only a small change from a June report, which estimated spending would rise 11.9 percent this year. Both the June and September surveys, however, reflected a substantial increase from an initial industry projection for a 7.3 percent increase in investment. That estimate was made at the end of last year. In 1987, investment spending rose a modest 2.3 percent after having fallen 3.9 percent in 1986. The weakness in those years was blamed on the soaring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit as a flood of imports reduced domestic demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods at the same time <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> firms were being priced out of overseas markets. For 1988, manufacturing firms expect to boost spending by 12.5 percent with plants making non-durable goods projecting an increase of 13.2 percent and companies manufacturing durable goods expecting an 11.7 percent increase. In other sectors, the report predicted an increase of 12.4 percent in capital investment by transportation companies, including airlines, and a 5.5 percent advance in the mining industry. This sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, had seen investment plummet 32 percent in 1986 and a further 2 percent in 1987 as oil companies cut back on exploration in the face of declining oil prices. Before removing the effects of inflation, business investment is projected to rise by 10.6 percent this year to $ 430.9 billion, following an increase of 2.7 percent in 1987.

<TEXT>
 The shooting down of an Afghan air force jet by <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> fighter pilots over <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has fueled a growing dispute between the two countries. Pakistani defense officials said the Afghan plane was on a bombing raid and that it was the third time Soviet-built aircraft with Afghan markings have bombed <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> territory in the past week. The <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government has denied the accusations and accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of sending a reconnaissance plane over its territory. Pakistani officials said today they still did not know the fate or nationality of the pilot who apparently ejected when a <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16 shot him down Wednesday near <LOCATION> Nawagai </LOCATION>, about 12 miles from the Afghan border. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said four planes, believed to be MiG-23s, were intercepted by a Pakistani air patrol after they had bombed two locations across the border, injuring 12 people. Afghan planes, which in the past have only darted over the border to bomb Afghan rebel and refugee camps, struck more than 30 miles into Pakistani territory on Sept. 1 and 5. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> lodged strong protests, telling <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> `` that if such attacks do not cease the entire responsibility for the serious consequences will rest on the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> authorities.'' <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government called the Pakistani allegations `` lies.'' <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> countered on Wednesday by claiming that a <ORGANIZATION> Pakistani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet had `` intruded into Afghan airspace and carried out a reconnaissance flight.'' At least four Afghan or Soviet aircraft have been shot down over Pakistani territory since Moslem insurgents began battling the government in 1978. On Aug. 4, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> shot down an intruding Soviet Su-25 fighter-bomber near the border. The Soviet pilot was handed over to his embassy in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on Aug. 17. Defense Minister <PERSON> Mahmood </PERSON> <PERSON> Haroon </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> still was seeking to acquire a sophisticated airborne early warning radar system to protect its rugged frontier region where ground-based radar is blinded by high mountain peaks. <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> has approached <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about two different air platform systems but has not filed a formal request. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials reportedly have stalled <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for fear the systems might escalate tensions with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to the east. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> accuse <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of violating the April 14 Soviet pullout accord by continuing to supply the rebels with mainly American arms. But under the pact, the superpowers tacitly agreed to continue aiding their respective sides until one of them stops. The result has been an escalation of guerrilla attacks as the Soviets turn the war increasingly over to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s demoralized army. September's bold air strikes appear to be testing <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>'s resolve following the death last month of the guerrilla's sponsor, President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> mediator for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> reported today that more than half the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have pulled out and the withdrawal is proceeding `` in a very satisfactory manner.'' The envoy, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, told reporters during the non-aligned movement's foreign ministers conference, that about 80 percent of Afghan territory `` has no foreign troops any more.'' But he added that the Soviet withdrawal has not yet resulted in `` any significant return'' of the millions of Afghan refugees who fled to neighboring countries during the nine-year Soviet occupation.

The 5-pound, 2 -LCB- - ounce girl was listed in fair condition at <ORGANIZATION> AMI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aurora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> Officials said she suffered from exposure and abrasions on her feet but will be fine. Six boys were on their way to <ORGANIZATION> Sable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday when they found the unclothed infant on a bath towel covered with birth fluid, her umbilical cord still attached, authorities said. The boys summoned the school's health professional, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>. `` She seemed to be in good condition, other than she was very cold,'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said. `` Her limbs were kind of blue and her face was pale.''

 A former police captain who had himself castrated in a bid for leniency has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for having sex with boys. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Elijah </PERSON> <PERSON> Pourciau </PERSON>, 62, pleaded guilty in April to aggravated crime against nature in cases involving four boys. Judge <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponder </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Pourciau </PERSON> on Wednesday to the maximum of 15 years on each of four counts and ordered the terms to be served concurrently. <PERSON> Pourciau </PERSON>, who retired in 1985 after 32 years on the <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> force, was arrested in 1986 after a parent of an 11-year-old neighbor complained of sexual abuse. The assaults on boys in the neighborhood began in 1981, police said. <PERSON> Pourciau </PERSON> voluntarily underwent castration in an effort to solve his sexual problem, a defense attorney said. After pronouncing sentence, the judge told <PERSON> Pourciau </PERSON>, `` I think you've made a sincere effort to rehabilitate yourself from this problem, this sickness, you have.''

 A woman has pleaded guilty to helping her boyfriend rape her teen-age daughter so the girl could bear the child the mother could not. In a rare case of a woman charged with rape, the 38-year-old mother pleaded guilty last week to attempted rape, admitting her role in the 1986 attack on her 14-year-old daughter. The mother wanted another baby but was unable to bear children, so she attempted to have her 31-year-old boyfriend get her daughter pregnant, the daughter told police. The boyfriend threatened to beat the girl's mother if the teen-ager refused to have sex with him, the girl said in an affidavit. The boyfriend slapped the mother in front of the girl, and the mother watched the sexual attack, the girl said. The rape was not reported until a year later, after the girl gave birth to a boy and social services authorities intervened. Social workers had sued the boyfriend for child support, and the girl's mother sought custody of the baby, Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> said. But lab tests showed that the boyfriend was not the baby's father, <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> said The father was the girl's own boyfriend, she said. The woman, who was indicted in April on a charge of rape, pleaded guilty Sept. 1 to the reduced charge. Judge <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said he would sentence her to probation Oct. 19, according to her lawyer, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Paquette </PERSON>. The woman's boyfriend pleaded guilty to rape Aug. 15. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said he will sentence him to no more than a year in jail on Sept. 26. The identities of those involved in the case have not been released.

 Israeli troops opened fire today on a gang of masked Palestinians who had ambushed their patrol with knives and clubs, killing one assailant and seriously wounding another, the army said. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, meanwhile, troops shot and wounded seven Palestinians, including four teen-agers and two 9-year-old girls, Arab hospital officials said. A general strike was observed in the occupied lands to mark the nine-month anniversary of the Palestinian uprising. Called by pro-PLO underground leaders of the revolt, it was viewed as a key test of their control in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. A rival underground group, the Moslem fundamentalist `` <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>,'' called the anniversary strike for Friday, underscoring a growing split in the uprising leadership. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, 14 Palestinians pleaded innocent today to charges of taking part in a stone-throwing protest that resulted in the death of a 15-year-old Jewish girl April 6. The defendants are among 20 charged in the death of <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, the first Israeli civilian killed in the uprising. Five Israelis and 260 Palestinians have died since the unrest began Dec. 8. <PERSON> Yaffa </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothchild </PERSON>, the attorney for the defendants, said six of the youths did not appear because military authorities had moved them from the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> jail and were unable to locate them for the hearing. Miss <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was killed when a group of Jewish settlers she was hiking with confronted Palestinians near the village of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, three miles south of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, and then walked into the village. The army and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> villagers contend Miss <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was accidentally shot by one of the Israelis. A political dispute broke out over a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invitation to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to attend a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Sept. 25. That will be a month before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s election, which pits <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' Labor Party against Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will host the meeting between <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who supports a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan, and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Meguid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who opposes parts of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan, accused <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of engineering the invitation to influence the Nov. 1 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> parliamentary election, which both he and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> have billed as a historic referendum on how to solve the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. `` The whole thing is so obvious. It's an election gimmick,'' <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Modai </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is unacceptable in the democratic world to involve foreign factors in domestic elections.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> dismissed the charges, saying he accepted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invitation to keep the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative `` alive and well.'' Today's fatality occured in the village of <LOCATION> Silat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harathiya </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s northernmost corner about 55 miles from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Palestinian witnesses said the clash broke out when a gang of masked Arabs trying to stop <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers from going to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> turned on an army patrol and attacked troops with stones, knives and clubs. Hospital officials identified the dead man as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, 36, and said he was shot in the head. A 21-year-old man was in serious condition with gunshot wounds to the abdomen and legs, the officials said. The death brought to 260 the number of Palestinians killed in the uprising. Today's PLO-ordered general strike was observed throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a stronghold of the rival Moslem fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, which means `` zeal'' in Arabic. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, however, graffiti scrawled across walls in red paint called on residents to observe the strike called by <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> for Friday. Some of the messages were painted over pro-PLO slogans.

 Showered with confetti by anti-nuclear campaigners, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise missiles to leave <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> under the superpower arms control treaty were flown out of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> today, less than a year after they arrived. `` Good riddance, do n't come back!'' shouted the protesters outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base at <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, as two of the 18 cruise missiles, the most recent to be deployed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, were driven away aboard camouflaged mobile launchers. The vehicles headed to the nearby base at <LOCATION> Alconbury </LOCATION>, where the missiles were put aboard a C141 aircraft and the launchers aboard a Galaxy C5. The two giant transport planes took off at 2 p.m. -LRB- 9 a.m. EDT -RRB- for a 12-hour non-stop flight, with midair refueling, to <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monthan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> for destruction under Soviet supervision. The small group of anti-nuclear campaigners watched the missiles on board two 55-foot transporters lumber through the gates and across the flat <LOCATION> Cambridgeshire </LOCATION> countryside for the last time. The protesters carried banners saying: `` This is only the first step.'' `` This is something we have been working for for nine years,'' said <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Beresford </PERSON>, secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. At <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Ambassador to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> hailed the missile departure as an achievement for the unity of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. Referring to the protesters, said: `` We are not here because some individuals, well-intentioned and innocent of the world's realities, kept vigils at our bases.'' The credit `` also belongs in part to -LRB- Soviet leader -RRB- <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who bargained in good faith to accept the wisdom of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s zero-option and acted upon it,'' said Price. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the agreement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last Dec. 8. British <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> said the missiles treaty was a `` stinging rebuke'' to the protesters. `` The Russians must show that they are prepared to change in a very real way their offensive military posture,'' <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> said. `` There is, I regret to say, no sign of them doing this so far.'' Younger did not rule out speculation that <PERSON> Molesworth </PERSON>, built at a cost of $ 76.5 million specifically to take 64 missiles, may be equipped with runways for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to deploy nuclear-capable F-111 bombers. <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> said no new land-based weapons would be introduced. Missile deployment at <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION> began last November, four years after the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise missiles deployed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> arrived at <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> Common, another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. No date has been set for the removal of 96 cruise missiles at <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION>. Officials said all <PERSON> Molesworth </PERSON>'s missiles would be gone in three months. The Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty, ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in June, set a 1991 deadline for the superpowers to eliminate their 2,700 land-based missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The missiles have a range of about 300 to 3,000 miles. The first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles to leave <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> under the agreement were nine <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 medium-range weapons, removed Sept. 1 from a base near <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began removing its medium-range missiles from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in February.

<TEXT>
 A well-known Soviet historian says <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> suffered `` clinical death'' in 1976 and was so weakened for the last six years of his rule that it wa difficult for him to perform simple duties or understand what was going on around him. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, in an article published in this week's edition of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News, painted a picture of a leader in such bad health that his aides took over most of his functions. `` <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> had the first serious problems with his health in 1969-1970,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> wrote. `` At the beginning of 1976, he had a clinical death. Doctors managed to revive him, but for the next three months he could n't work, as his speech and abilities to think were impaired.'' The <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> era has been under increasing attack lately. The Moscow News article appeared at the same time <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s son-in-law, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, and eight co-defendants went on trial faced with several charges involving corruption and bribery <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a frequent commentator on Soviet history, also said <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> possessed no outstanding characteristics and was pushed into the country's top leadership job. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> is the author of `` Let History Judge,'' a celebrated indictment of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s rule. He was expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after a letter he wrote appeared in an emigre journal. With his brother <PERSON> Zhores </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, he also has written a piercing criticism of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>. Although he never challenged the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> was on the outs with officials during the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> period. State-owned publications began printing his works just this year under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness. In the six years before his death on Nov. 10, 1982, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was constantly attended by a group of doctors. `` They were always on duty. At those places where he used to stay, there were specially equipped medical laboratories,'' the historian said in the article. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s working day was cut to a few hours after his brush with death and his vacations expanded from one to two annually. `` The state of health of our leaders is not a topic dicussed in the press, but his -LRB- <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s -RRB- progressing illness was evident to everyone who saw him on television,'' the article said. `` Naturally, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s illness affected his abilities to rule the country. He often interrupted fulfillment of his duties and let his personal aides take over,'' the article said. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said the public eventually lost respect for <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> because of occasional public appearances during which the leader had to be supported under each arm. The historian blamed `` many influential and corrupted people from his close circle'' for the public's loss of confidence in their leader. `` They managed to achieve the worst,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. `` Namely that the old age and illness of a Soviet leader became an object not of sympathy among citizens, but of open ridicule and irritation.'' <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was plagued with health problems for the final 12 years of his rule, but even as a younger, healthier man he lacked outstanding qualities, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> wrote. `` <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was not a great or even outstanding man. If I were asked to characterize him in a few words, I would say he was weak in almost all spheres of his personality,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>South Korea Urged to Release Prisoners, Change Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is improving its human rights record but holds about 600 political prisoners, and torture still occurs, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said today. The international human rights group urged the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government to make further improvements. It called for the release of political prisoners, an end to torture and other ill-treatment of detainees and changes in laws to allow peaceful expression of opposition to the government. The report comes a week before the opening of the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. In a report called `` Detention of Prisoners of Conscience and Torture Continue,'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> noted that major political changes since last summer have ushered in some improvements in the human rights area. The government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo came into power after <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, then chairman of the ruling party, pledged a package of democratic reforms, including release of political prisoners, in response to violent demonstrations in June 1987. `` There have been releases and amnesties, but we think they've been too few,'' the group said While the government says nearly 1,300 political prisoners have been released since last year, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> claims the number is 400. The human rights group also said 4,000 former political prisoners' civil rights have been restored in this period, about half the number claimed by the government. The report said `` arrests on political grounds have continued,'' with about 600 people imprisoned for political or trade union activities. Among the 600, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> is calling for the release of 28 it has adopted as prisoners of conscience, and is investigating the cases of another 70. The group defines prisoners of conscience as those `` detained for belief, color, sex, ethnic origin, language or religion provided they have n't used or advocated violence.'' Students who threw rocks in demonstrations could not be considered, an official said. While constitutional amendments have strengthened laws protecting the rights of prisoners, `` in practice these rights are still not always respected,'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. Government sensitivity to world attention during the Sept. 17 to Oct. 2 Olympic Games may help improve the situation, but the Games do not guarantee changes, a representative of the group said. The researcher said that in the long-term, `` of course the attention of the whole world matters ... but things have changed very quickly in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. We just do n't know what might happen after -LRB- the games. -RRB-'' The researcher insisted on anonymity, saying it was <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> policy.

 Radical students engaged in running street battles with riot police today to protest what they called a `` half Olympics,'' and an opposition leader predicted the Olympic Games would bring political stability to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The most violent protest was in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, where 600 students at <ORGANIZATION> Chonam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> tossed rocks and firebombs at riot police at an anti-Olympic rally, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. The news agency said fighting erupted when riot police fired tear gas to stop students from marching off campus, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. No injuries or arrests were reported. Authorities said about 500 radical students and 50 elderly people held a peaceful rally at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Students in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> and other provincial cities have accused the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo of using the Olympic Games to suppress free movement. The Games will be held in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> from Sept. 17 to Oct. 2. Radical students have demanded that the Olympics, which they term `` half-Olympics,'' be shared with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to ease tension on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, which was divided in 1945 at the end of World War II. Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today that he believed the Olympics would unite the South Korean people. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said Koreans wanted the Olympics to be a major success and that he was confident there would be no attempt to disrupt the Games. `` The absolute majority of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people want to see successful Olympics,'' the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> also said he doubted communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would make any attempt to disrupt the Olympics because of the participation of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> could not afford to anger its powerful communist allies by staging terrorist attacks on the Games. `` With the participation of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the Olympics the safety of the Games is assured,'' he said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has boycotted the Olympics and says it wo n't participate unless it is allowed to be a co-host at the Games The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said only one city can be a host at the Olympics. South Korean officials have said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> might try to stage terrorist attacks to disrupt the Olympics. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has a long history of attacks on its southern rival. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and rival opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> both ran in last December's presidential election, splitting the vote against government candidate <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Afghan Refugees To Be Trained In Mine Disposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Afghan refugees are to be trained to dispose of the thousands of land mines left by Soviet and government forces during the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said today. The proposed program by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office coordinating aid for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> also calls for public information campaigns to warn women and children who return home about the danger of mines planted in Afghan fields and roads. `` The first step is to train one or two returnees per village to have some idea of how to defuse a mine and dispose of it,'' said the official, an aide to the chief of the Geneva-based office, Prince <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>. The official spoke on condition he not be identified by name. The number of mines littering the Afghan countryside is estimated at hundreds of thousands to several million, the aide said. Using posters and radio programs, the campaign would `` try to inform as many as possible on the hazards, so women and children would be able to recognize a mine and not, for example, pick it up,'' he said. Another aspect would be first aid training `` since there will unfortunately always be people blown up by mines,'' he added. Two basic types of mines were used in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>: traditional anti-tank devices placed on roads, mountain passes or around garrisons, and smaller anti-personnel mines designed to maim people. Millions of Afghans fled to neighboring countries such as <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> to escape the decade-long fighting between the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and Moslem guerrillas seeking its overthrow. The Afghan government says 150,000 refugees have returned home since the signing of the U.N.-sponsored <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> accord last April, but the figure has not been independently confirmed. Soviet troops intervened in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1978 to help prop up a Marxist government. Under the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> agreement, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> pledged to withdraw half its contingent by last month and to complete the pullout by mid-February. U.N officials have said the Soviets already have pulled out more than half its troops.

And then you go about that in a very methodical way.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear operation has problems, as do most nuclear operations today,'' said <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON>, also a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> man. `` But Admiral White has brought us a long way toward recovery and I fully intend to carry on that recovery.'' White, who was hired to turn the troubled nuclear section around, spent more than $ 1 billion to rejuvenate the program, which was shut down in August 1985 because of safety concerns about its five licensed reactors. Since then, Unit 2 at <ORGANIZATION> Sequoyah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION> has returned to operation and Unit 1 is scheduled for restart this month. Unit 2 at <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> Ferry Nuclear Plant near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, is expected to be back on line by spring. White, who will resign next month, had indicated recently he would probably leave his $ 355,200-a-year job when his contract expires to be with his family in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The retired admiral who once headed the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear submarine program has been under fire from congressional staffers critical of <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear program.

White has denied the charges, and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Charnoff </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>, said he expects the investigation to be dismissed soon. <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> will receive $ 77,300 a year, the maximum for federal employees, <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> said. He will be eligible for performance bonuses that could increase his income to more than $ 200,000 annually.

 <LOCATION> WOODBURY </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> _ Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> businessmen today that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will `` pay the price'' for the huge federal budget deficits of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. But the former <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> insurance executive said the Democratic ticket understands the needs of business and will fight the deficits with frugal management and an aggressive trade policy. `` During this election, you're going to hear a lot about a five-year-economic boom,'' he said, referring to the current expansion. But he said accomplishing that was no trick when the government was writing `` hot checks'' with deficits of more than $ 150 billion a year. `` If you listen to this administration, you would think they are fiscal conservatives,'' he said. `` But they have not submitted one balanced budget.'' `` We're all going to pay the price for this borrow-and-spend philosophy,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> received a polite reception from the largely <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> at the breakfast. But he got a hearty hand when he said evacuation plans for nuclear plants should be made at the local level. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said the federal government can make those plans, a controversial stand on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> where the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant has been kept from starting operations for five years because of dispute over whether <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> could ever by successfully evacuated in case of an accident. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> arrived on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, after weeks of concentrating in his native <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the South, to begin a three-day, coast-to-coast campaign trip today with a taste of the food and money available in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. After his <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> speech, he was heading to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> for a fund-raiser for his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign. He held another <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign fundraiser Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law allows <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to run for both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the vice presidency. He says he's doing that because dropping out of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race would automatically hand his seat to a Republican. The <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> <PERSON> Delicatessan </PERSON> was on <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s schedule this afternoon. The deli, featured in <PERSON> Woddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s movie `` Broadway <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>,'' is famous for huge helpings of pastrami, tongue, and corned beef. Both <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are slated to speak at a gala $ 5 million <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> tonight. It was expected to be the largest single fund-raising event in the party's history. Then for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> it's off to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Califorinia </LOCATION> on Friday and Saturday before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has stopped in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on every other campaign swing he has taken since being named to the ticket, as his home state with its 29 electoral votes could swing the election. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> earlier this week, and he plans to campaign there again next week. Recent polls show the Democrats trailing the Republicans slightly in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also claims residence. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> returned from its summer recess this week and both <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, were in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday to attend to business there. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters that it will be difficult for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do its work given the partisan political atmosphere. `` There's no question that it's complicating the process,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> renewed his criticism of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of a defense bill recently as an attempt to help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` You're going to see more and more of that, I'm afraid,'' he said.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called for strengthening <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s non-nuclear conventional forces today in a speech that won a warm reception from an American Legion convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> praised President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for signing the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles, and he lauded the war record and patriotism of Republican presidential rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Both men had been received in friendly fashion by the veterans group earlier this week. However, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticized the administration in connection with its spending on veterans' programs. And he suggested the national debt, which has risen sharply during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, would cramp efforts to build up the nation's military might `` After eight years and $ 2 trillion, we still do n't have an anti-tank weapon that can stop modern Soviet tanks,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We can not build a strong national defense on a mountain of debt.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave no specifics on his plans to improve conventional forces and said at a news conference later that he would give details next week. Also at the news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would support deployment of the space-based Strategic Defense Initiative if research proved it would work and if it was determined to be in the national interest. However, when questioned on the issue, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said deployment of SDI would be a violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and he did not want to scrap that pact. `` I think it is in our best interest to observe that treaty,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` For our own sake, we have to continue with research.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was not worried about a new <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll, showing him behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 8 percentage points. `` I do n't think we're slipping, and I do n't think we're in disarray,'' he said. Wednesday night, in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised a Jewish group that he would provide `` generous'' aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, while he attacked the Republicans for selling weapons to its <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> enemies. `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I are going to say ` no' to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> shopping lists that endanger the security of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. In interviews with <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> television stations Wednesday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his call for a `` tough, strong lean defense'' will be tempered by the need for a strong economy. Speaking Wednesday to a convention of B'nai B'rith, the Democratic presidential nominee referred repeatedly to his wife, who is Jewish, and gave a new year's greeting in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> as he tried to demonstrate a sensitivity to Jewish culture and concerns. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor drew cheers when he told the convention that in a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration `` there will be no trips to <LOCATION> Bitburg </LOCATION>,'' referring to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit to a West German cemetery where members of the Nazi SS were buried. As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was finishing his speech in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, his campaign vice chairman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, was meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose support for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> has angered American Jews. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said he had no details on the meeting between <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In his B'nai B'rith speech, which came shortly after one delivered by Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> referred only in passing to the Palestinian uprising in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied territories on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and said that as president he would not recognize a `` unilateral'' declaration of a Palestinian state He pledged continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which he praised as `` a special place ... committed to peace.'' `` From the day of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s rebirth four decades ago, we Americans have understood that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s fate is our fate,'' he said. `` We're going to continue to help <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> defend itself by providing generous levels of military and economic aid,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. However, he singled out <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, for voting in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> against packages aiding <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and faulted Republicans for selling aircraft and missiles to other nations in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` The Republicans have sold AWACS to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mavericks </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, Stingers to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and billions of additional dollars worth of sophisticated arms to Arab countries that refuse to make peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has supported those sales, and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has voted for them. `` We will not sell weapons that would threaten the security of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to any nation,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And we will work to persuade our <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies to join us in that policy.''

<HEAD>Cosmonauts Discuss Problem-Plagued Spaceflight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cosmonauts just returned from a problem-plagued space mission described cramped quarters, food and water shortages and equipment problems but did not address questions about their performance, a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> dispatch indicated today. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> had suggested Wednesday that the commander of the Soyuz TM-5 capsule, stranded in orbit for a day, may have worsened equipment problems by not following proper emergency procedures. The capsule, carrying commander <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> and the first Afghan in space, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohmand </PERSON>, landed safely early Wednesday in the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. At a news conference today for Soviet and Afghan reporters at the Baikonur Space Center, near the landing site, the cosmonauts said they had only 105 cubic feet between them. They were stuck in the capsule for 26 hours. `` Immobility was the biggest problem,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, reported. The cosmonauts had an emergency supply of food and water, but decided not to use it until absolutely necessary, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Other reports have said the capsule had no toilet, virtually no room to move around, and enough air for only two days. The spacemen were asked about problems that forced postponement of their reentry after their capsule undocked Tuesday from the orbiting space station Mir. `` During the first landing attempt, undertaken on Sept. 6, everything went as scheduled,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> as saying. `` But 30 seconds before the engine start-up, there occurred a disruption in the operation of the infrared vertical sensor. The computer was unable to judge whether the spacecraft was correctly oriented, and the engine was shut off.'' The engine <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> referred to is supposed to brake the capsule so it can safely pass through the atmosphere. The cosmonaut said a second attempt to fire the engine was made later, but that it slowed the capsule too much and the burn was terminated. Landing was put off until Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not report any comments by the crew at the news conference about their performance. The newspaper said reporters asked deputy flight chief <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> whether the commander failed to follow proper procedure during the second landing attempt. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> as saying: `` We still must painstakingly study the whole situation.'' <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> said backup landing sites could have been used, so there was no rush to fire the reentry engine. Then, appearing to defend <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON>, he said it `` could be understood in a purely human way'' why the commander wanted to land at the designated time and place. <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> had said in a capsule-side interview broadcast on television Wednesday that he and <LOCATION> Mohmand </LOCATION> had wanted to make a third attempt at landing on Tuesday but that the craft might have touched down outside Soviet territory. He said the crew preferred to wait until landing could be assured in <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON>, a 47-year-old veteran military pilot, flew in space for 175 days in 1979 and 150 days in 1983. The public questioning of a cosmonaut's performance was highly unusual in the Soviet space program. It reflected the more open discussion of problems encouraged by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> under his policy of `` glasnost.''

 The parents of a black teen-ager who was barred from playing tennis with her high school team at an all-white country club have sued for $ 2 million. The Rev. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitfield </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Lorene </PERSON>, filed the civil rights suit Wednesday in federal court on behalf of themselves and their daughter, <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON>, 16.

The suit contends that the <LOCATION> Forrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> high school coach told her she could n't play at the club. The girl and her opponent went to a city court to play their match. Named as defendants are the tennis coaches, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosford </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Earle </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowlin </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Forrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the school districts and the private club. `` We hope to send an emphatic message to those people who would do such a thing against a young girl,'' said the Whitfields' attorney, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> Calls Wednesday to <PERSON> Bowlin </PERSON>'s home went unanswered. In July, he told reporters he was following long-standing <ORGANIZATION> Forrest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> rules in barring the black teen-ager from playing there. `` I really and truly thought the country clubs had the right to tell us who had the right to play,'' <PERSON> Bowlin </PERSON> said. He said that he wrote a letter of apology to <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitfield </PERSON> and that he would cooperate with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitfield </PERSON> and her attorneys `` in seeing that this custom and practice is ended immediately.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, country club president, had said that the club has no written policy prohibiting blacks.

 The skipper of the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> was warned that a plane approaching the ship July 3 might be a commercial airliner, but he ordered the ship's missiles fired in the mistaken belief it was an Iranian F-14, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today. The warning was called out by one of the officers in the confusion of the combat center on the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, the investigators said. Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> waved his hand in acknowledgement of the warning. But other factors, most of them human errors by crew members made under stress, led <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> to erroneously conclude that the plane approaching his ship was an Iranian military jet that had just taken off from a military-civilian airfield at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Flight 655, which had flown out of the same airfield, was shot down by two missiles from the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, killing all 292 persons aboard. Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigating team, said his probe had turned up a number of mistakes by the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> crew. Among those mistakes were erroneously concluding that the plane was descending rather than climbing, and that the plane was outside a civilian air corridor. <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> outlined to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> the report released by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> three weeks ago. There was no criticism of <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> among panel members. `` The easiest thing any of us can do is second-guess, and that's not what we want to do,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> is a $ 1 billion Aegis-class cruiser, equipped with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s most sophisticated air defense system. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators attributed the incident to human errors made under stress and during `` the fog of war.'' They said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers misread data from the Aegis system and gave mistaken information to <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>. A public version of the report was released three weeks ago. A classified version has also been sent to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said many of the questions surrounding the incident had been answered by the Fogarty investigation `` But we want a chance to talk to him in person and ask some questions,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> explained. `` I think we are going to be looking at how the Aegis system performed, how the weapons on board performed, and other secondary questions like that.'' The Fogarty investigation found that the Aegis system worked as designed. `` Overall, I think I'm pretty sympathetic to the plight of the captain and I think there's a lot of sympathy for him here, given the compressed time frame for making a decision and given the other constraints of operating a blue-water ship in a brown-water environment,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. He was referring to using the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which was designed for large-scale, open-ocean situations, in the small, crowded <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The ship was on duty as part of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy of protecting tankers in the gulf. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s comments echoed statements made by top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officers last month when the report was released. Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, said that given the confusion surrounding an earlier fight between the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and Iranian gunboats, `` Capt. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> acted reasonably and did what his nation expected of him in the defense of his ship and crew.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> called the airliner's destruction `` a by-product'' of the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. The two nations are now negotiating through the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to end the conflict. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was to leave from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last Sunday, but its departure has been postponed until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been assured there is no longer a need for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tanker escorts in the region. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' withdrawal from the carrier battle group in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> would reduce the American naval force in the region from 27 to 26 warships, the first reduction since the Iran-Iraq cease-fire officially went into effect Aug. 15. The Pentagon says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet will be scaled back if the cease-fire holds. But it has given no timetable, and other ships in the force are still being replaced on schedule.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today watched the destruction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile stages as part of a U.S.-Soviet treaty and called it `` a moment when the tides of history turned.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> blended economic and military messages, telling the American Legion the nation ca n't build defense `` on a mountain of debt. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican presidential nominee, flew to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to watch the missile engines destroyed today as Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got a warm reception from the veterans group in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky. The night before, in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, the presidential rivals stressed concern for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> while sharply criticizing each other. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> waffles on creation of a Palestinian state and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused the Republican ticket of supporting the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s foes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at the Pershing missile-engine destruction, said it was `` the day we began to reverse the arms race ... one of those unique moments in the career of man, a moment when the tides of history turned, that a new future dawned.'' He joined other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Longhorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> plant to see destruction of the engines, which are part of the 859 weapons the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has agreed to destory over the next three years under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has already destroyed several of its counterpart SS-20 missiles. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, speaking today to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION>, one day after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> addressed the group, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must improve its conventional, non-nuclear forces. `` After eight years and $ 2 trillion, we still do n't have an anti-tank weapon that can stop modern Soviet tanks,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The Democratic presidential nominee, who has frequently criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for allowing the national debt to soar, said, `` We can not build a strong national defense on a mountain of debt.'' Both candidates made their cases Wednesday as advocates of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> while addressing the convention of B'nai B'rith, the Jewish service organization. `` Strength works better than weakness if you want to get both peace and security,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said he opposes creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state but believes Palestinians `` must be involved at every step'' in the peace negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Republican vice president charged <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lacks a clear stand on creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, saying: `` Anyone who has trouble making up his mind on this issue, or who proposes to leave it open, just does n't understand the dangers to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; just does n't understand the very real threats that continue to exist.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, answering that he would `` never recognize a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state or government in exile,'' went on to criticize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for supporting arms sales to Arab countries that are potential threats to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We will not sell weapons that would threaten the security of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to any nation,'' the Democratic nominee said, after reading off a list of weapons sales to Arab countries with the support of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received a boost in the latest <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll, which showed the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate ahead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 51 percent to 43 percent. The survey of 1,104 likely voters was conducted Aug. 31 to Sept. 6 and had a margin of error of 3.5 points. The Post cautioned that the results may be unusual because many people were away from their homes during the Labor Day holiday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said the candidate always believed it would be a tight race. In an apparent effort to defuse <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> claims that he is insensitive to the concerns of working people, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> newspapers that he will soon propose boosting the minimum wage. The administration opposes an increase, and campaign sources said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expected to link his proposal with a call for a training wage, below the regular minimum wage, to cover new hires and teen-agers. <PERSON> Top </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides were linked in published and broadcast reports to lobbying activity for the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, who has been under investigation in this country because of alleged drug activities. The reports centered on a 20-page contract proposal in which the lobbying firm of <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manafort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> said it could create a `` backchannel relationship'' with the administration and counter criticism by the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, senior adviser <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> and scheduler <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> were named in the proposal. The firm charged $ 800,000 for the lobbying activity from April 1985 to September 1986. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the time was head of a drug-enforcement effort that included investigations of <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> characterized the contract language as `` salesman's hyperbole.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today received the endorsement of the 1.9 million-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, tending to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> duties Wednesday, was damned with faint praise by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader and former presidential candidate <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he thought <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was `` becoming an asset'' to the Republican ticket, and he put the stress on `` becoming.'' For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Wednesday, Sept. 7, 1988, may not exactly live in infamy but is at least a likely entry in the political blunder hall of fame. Explaining how he wrongly told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> crowd that Sept. 7 was the anniversary of the 1941 Japanese bombing of <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> that brought <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> into World War II, instead of the Dec. 7 date <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> declared would live in infamy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I wanted to work <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in and just got carried away.''

 About 1 million people, including government officials and intelligence agents, marched in the capital today demanding democracy. Mobs beheaded three people who tried to poison the protesters. In a <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> suburb, security forces shot and injured 17 people to halt looting. The capital came to a standstill as uniformed state factory workers, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nuns, housewives and a group of 200 blind people joined in mass marches and a general strike to demand an end to 26 years of authoritarian rule. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other foreign governments evacuated dependents of diplomats and other citizens, diplomats said. An attempt by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to do the same was delayed by an airport strike. Residents said more than 700,000 protesters marched in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, 350 miles north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, and the same number in <LOCATION> Monywa </LOCATION>, an important trading town 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>. About 100,000 marched in <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION>, the Mon State capital 50 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. A Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said the evacuations were ordered because embassies believed the country was `` sliding toward chaos.'' Factory workers, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nuns, students and teachers marched through the capital to press for an end of repressive, one-party rule. Opposition leaders are demanding an interim government to usher in a multiparty system. Also participating were employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, the Parliament office, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>, or civilian intelligence, and uniformed officers of the state-owned shipping line. Most held banners identifying their groups. The protest was the largest in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> since Aug. 24, when President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> lifted martial law in the capital and nationwide curfews. Today's march was largely peaceful, but sources said a mob beat to death two men and a woman who gave poisoned ice water to several demonstrators, including schoolchildren, and then beheaded them. Demonstrators took the three to a monastery. After they confessed to having been paid $ 42 each to poison protesters, a waiting mob dragged them outside and beheaded them, hanging their heads on posts at a major junction. It was not clear whether any protesters had been poisoned. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said security forces today shot and wounded 17 people as authorities moved to stop a mob of 500 people from looting a cigarette factory in a <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> suburb. An army officer was overpowered by mobs and beaten near the capital's Swedagon Pagoda, it said The radio said authorities the previous day retrieved from <LOCATION> Inya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> seven bodies of people who had been stabbed and drowned. Government radio had said Wednesday that security forces had shot dead five people and wounded six to halt widespread looting in the capital the past two days. It said looting had broken out in 38 areas of the capital and that more than $ 43 million in state property had been plundered since the beginning of August. The deaths brought to at least 117 the number of protesters reported killed by security forces since last month. Foreign diplomats say the death toll could be in the hundreds. Diplomatic sources said 37 dependents of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> officials were evacuated Wednesday. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with about 50 nationals, have the largest missions in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. The sources said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had recalled more than 100 technicians and others would be evacuated. Japanese authorities said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s largest aid donor, recently evacuated some dependents of embassy staff and has urged businessmen and dependents of Japanese nationals to leave <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Others embassies also were evacuating dependents. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> had planned to evacuate the first of its up to 100 dependents today, but their commercial flight to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, was canceled due to a strike at <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Opposition leaders hoped today's would be the largest of the many mass protests that have driven two governments from office in less than two months. Demonstrators have not threatened foreigners and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy has been a popular rallying point, with protesters applauding the American flag. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> planned a meeting Monday to consider a referendum on one-party rule, despite a protesters' demand for an interim government first. The party has ruled since a 1962 military coup that brought Ne Win to power. His rigid socialist and isolationist policies have made <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> one of the world's poorest nations. Turmoil began in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> with student riots in September 1987 that led to street protests in March and June. Ne Win resigned July 23 and was succeeded by a hard-line former general, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who lasted only 17 days. He was replaced by <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader since 1962. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> called for the referendum on ending one-party rule.

 A space mission that endangered two cosmonauts was hastily organized for `` pure propaganda'' reasons and the crewmen were lucky to escape with their lives, according to an American expert on the Soviet space program. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said Soyuz TM-5, with an Afghan crewman aboard, was rushed into space a year ahead of schedule to assure that it flew before Soviet troops completed withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` They asked for this trouble by throwing this mission together for pure propaganda,'' said <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON>, a space engineer and author of several books on the Soviet space program. The craft landed safely Wednesday after a tense 24 hours in which malfunctions threatened to leave the cosmonauts marooned in orbit. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said he believes the cosmonauts `` were seconds away from death'' when a de-orbit rocket engine shut down prematurely left the Soyuz TM-5 in an orbit 155 miles above the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Had the rocket fired for only a minute longer, he said, the craft could have fallen through the atmosphere and burned. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space expert, agreed that the Soyuz mission was organized quickly, but he doubts the rush was related to the malfunction. `` It -LRB- the mission -RRB- was accelerated and there is every reason to believe it was politically motivated,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who works for <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> engineering in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, a major space contractor. `` But that had absolutely no impact on the problem that occurred on the spacecraft.'' Soyuz TM-5, commanded by veteran cosmonaut <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> and with <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohmand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on board, undocked from the Mir space station early Tuesday on what was expected to be a three-hour flight back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. But the craft's braking rocket failed to fire on time and then, seven minutes later, fired automatically for three seconds. Two orbits later, the rocket fired again, but shut down after about 60 seconds. This left the craft in a 155-mile orbit. A third attempt was successful and the Soyuz landed safely and on target in the Soviet province of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. At a news conference today for Soviet and Afghan reporters at the Baikonur Space Center, near the landing site, the cosmonauts said they had only 105 cubic feet between them. They were stuck in the capsule for 26 hours. The cosmonauts had an emergency supply of food and water, but decided not to use it until absolutely necessary, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, reported. Other reports have said the capsule had no toilet, virtually no room to move around, and enough air for only two days. The spacemen were asked to describe what happened after their capsule undocked Tuesday from the orbiting space station Mir. `` During the first landing attempt, undertaken on Sept. 6, everything went as scheduled,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> as saying. `` But 30 seconds before the engine start-up, there occurred a disruption in the operation of the infrared vertical sensor. The computer was unable to judge whether the spacecraft was correctly oriented, and the engine was shut off.'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said that based on Soviet public discussions and on tracking data collected by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Space Command in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, he believes the problem was caused by some type of computer `` software glitch.'' `` The lighting at the de-orbit burn was not standard, and had never been followed in the four previous TM flights,'' said <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON>. `` The TM is a completely re-engineered spacecraft with new computers, new software, new guidance.'' He said the Soyuz TM aligns itself for the braking rocket firing by taking readings with a guidance sensor on the Earth's horizon. On the four earlier flights, these readings were taken as the Soyuz TM craft were approaching sunrise. For Soyuz TM-5, said <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON>, the readings were taken after sunset, in the darkness. <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said he believes the `` fault detection'' system in the computer was `` falsely rejecting the data'' from the sensor. `` The computer disbelieved the data,'' he said. In the first attempt, the machine failed to fire the rocket until it received acceptable data. This came seven minutes too late, and the cosmonauts manually turned off the rocket after three seconds. Two orbits later, the computer turned the rocket on and it fired for about 60 seconds, <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said, before it again automatically halted the rocket engine. `` The cutoff of that burn was lucky for them,'' he said. `` It was a life-saving accident.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> disagreed with <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON>'s assessment. `` I give the Soviets credit enough to program the computer in such a manner that it would not shut down'' and leave the craft in `` a hazardous position,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said that `` all of the Soviet statements are consistent with this scenario.'' He said permitting the computer to fire the engine randomly `` was pretty sloppy flying'' by the cosmonaut crew. <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> also said `` it was unreasonable to assume that the computer software would be smart enough to shut down'' the rocket engine and to automatically leave the craft in a safe orbit. He said it would take months to develop and test a computer program for the lighting conditions encountered by Soyuz TM-5 and `` it's clear they did n't have the time to do it right. Soviet spacefarers usually receive 18 months of training and preparation before a mission, and <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said the crew of Soyuz TM-5 was together for only six months before launch.

<HEAD>Paper's Attorney Says JOA Should Be Allowed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge was urged today to allow <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers to complete a partial merger under a joint operating agreement approved last month by then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Attorney <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> dismissed suggestions by opponents of the joint operating agreement -LRB- JOA -RRB- that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had ignored the conclusions of an administrative law judge that the papers didn's qualify for the anti-trust exemption <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` is under no compunction at any stage of the proceeding to accept any conclusion of the administrative law judge,'' said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, who represents <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Before leaving office last month, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> found that the Free Press, a morning paper that has lost $ 100 million in nine years, was a failing newspaper under the 1970 Newspaper Preservation Act. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> approved a joint operating agreement between the Free Press and the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The partial merger was temporarily blocked by court order until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> has a chance to rule on a legal challenge. <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> said he would issue a ruling by next week. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, an attorney representing <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an ndependent Press, charged that the two dailies engaged in a bitter war of price cutting to either put each other out of business or qualify for a lucrative joint operating agreement. `` Did <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intend to give large corporations like <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> the opportunity to gain a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> simply by cutting prices, thus creating a record of loss?'' <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Millet </PERSON> said `` there absolutely was no evidence of collusion'' between the Free Press and The News, which was bought by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, several months before the joint operating agreement was formally sought. `` The fact that these two papers considered the option and discussed this over a period of time is not an argument that a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> should n't occur,'' <PERSON> Millet </PERSON> said. Those discussions were a `` natural consequence'' of the fact that both papers sustained losses while cutting advertising and circulation rates to gain dominance in the market, <PERSON> Millet </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, an elder statesman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who served as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary under President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, said the News had rejected several Free Press overtures to joint their production and commercial departments. The News was `` determined to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> as far down as they can because in the news business you try to become the dominant paper,'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. `` As soon as you find yourself in the second position, you are probably on your way out.'' While the Free Press was locked in bitter competition with the News, `` every year except one, they lost more money than they lost the year before.'' `` Knight-Ridder, during the eight-year period, poured $ 176 million into the Free Press in an effort to keep it afloat,'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. `` At the end of the period, the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> was losing more money then they were at the beginning.'' <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has threatened to close the Free Press if the joint operating agreement is not allowed to go through. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said closing the Free Press would cost 2,200 jobs while between 600 and 800 jobs would be eliminated if the two dailies combined their business operations. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision was arbitrary because he ignored the administrative law judge's recommendation. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> disregarded the administrative law judge's conclusion that if the partial merger were not approved, the News, which has also posted significant losses, would eventually raise its prices, thereby allowing the Free Press to do the same, <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said many of the administrative law judge's conclusions `` got so far beyond the question of fact that you get into the realm of speculation.'' <PERSON> Millet </PERSON> said the opponents have to prove `` the decision is irrational, not that they do n't like it or they think the administrative law judge recommended a contrary result.''

 Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today viewed the fiery destruction of a set of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intermediate-range missile engines and said the demolition marks `` the day we began to reverse the arms race.'' The vice president, who watched as the two <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> missile engines were fired _ the first to be destroyed deliberately under the U.S.-Soviet arms reduction treaty, said this is `` one of those unique moments in the career of man, a moment when the tides of history turned, that a new future dawned.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials on the reviewing stand at the <ORGANIZATION> Longhorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> plant here to witness the demolition of the two engines, which are among the 859 weapons that the two superpowers have agreed to destroy over the next three years. Peering through binoculars from a distance of about 1,000 feet, the vice president watched as the motor of a Pershing II missile engine was fired to burn up its fuel followed by the firing of a smaller Pershing 1a rocket engine. The destruction was accompanied by a thunderous blast that lasted about a minute and then a loud cheer from those on the reviewing stand. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has already demolished several of its counterpart SS-20 missiles under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty signed last December. `` We, too, are sending our INF missiles to the junkyards,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The missile stages we destroy today are just a beginning. It is a moment we will be able to tell our children and grandchildren about _ this was the day we began to reverse the arms race, this was the day we began destroying the weapons of destruction.'' Nuclear warheads of the missiles are to be dismantled under the same agreement. Even though the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign paid for the trip, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee was attending the event in his official capacity as vice president, aides said. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, told reporters he did not believe the vice president had unfair advantage over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because of his ability to participate in the program. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been associated with the efforts to achieve an INF treaty for many years. It's something I think he is legitimately entitled to participate in,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he `` just got messed up'' when he told an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> audience that it was the 47th anniversary of <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Day </LOCATION> _ three months in advance of the actual day. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s embarrassing gaffe, which he corrected after noticing the perplexed expressions in his audience, happened when `` I wanted to work <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in and just got carried away,'' he told reporters traveling with him on Air Force Two. `` I looked up and saw incredulity on the face of one particular guy and I thought, ` Whoops! My heavens I've done it!' So I was glad to correct it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received a boost in the latest <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll, which showed the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate ahead of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 51 percent to 43 percent. The survey of 1,104 likely voters was conducted Aug. 31 to Sept. 6 and had a margin of error of 3.5 points. The Post cautioned that the results may be unusual because many people were away from their homes during the Labor Day holiday. In an apparent effort to defuse <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> claims that he is insensitive to the concerns of working people, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> newspapers that he will soon propose an increase in the minimum wage. The administration opposes an increase, and campaign sources said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expected to link the increase with a below-minimum training wage for new hires and for teen-agers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the B'nai B'rith convention Wednesday in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> that the treaty `` to eliminate a whole class of nuclear weapons'' could not have been negotiated from a position of weakness. `` Strength works better than weakness if you want to get both peace and security,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not refer to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> directly in his speech to the B'nai B'rith, a national Jewish service organization. But in his earlier talk to the American Legion convention in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, he suggested his rival's defense policies would `` leave <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> hostage to Soviet ballistic missiles.'' He said Soviets were now deploying two new intercontinental ballistic missiles. `` So even with perestroika, Soviet military modernization has not slackened,'' he said. `` Soviet military spending continues to rise.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also: _ Told the B'nai B'rith that he opposes creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state but believes Palestinians `` must be involved at every step'' in the peace negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ Said anti-abortion demonstrators `` went too far'' in recent noisy protests against Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, awaiting trial on racketeering charges in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> bribery case, said today he was an innocent man victimized by the media and investigators out to drive former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> from office. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, at a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, defended his longtime friend, saying <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had received more `` calumny from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> media'' than any public official in memory. `` I am persuaded that much of what went on was an effort to drive <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> from office. ... I proved to be a most attractive vehicle to help accomplish that goal,'' said the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> trial attorney. He said he had made some `` honest mistakes'' in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I think I came into the big leagues thinking I had had adequate spring training when I had n't,'' he said. `` I'm telling you the sytem caught an innocent man and the media played a role in it,'' said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. `` The <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> that was portrayed in The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in most publications which covered me ... never existed, does not exist, did not exist,'' he said. `` I had on one side of me <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and on the other side of me <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. How could I not have been an attractive object for the media?'' said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who complained that his life and the lives of his children had been invaded by `` the anonymous assassins of the media.'' He depicted himself as a self-made man, grandson of a button-hole maker who won a scholarship and worked his way through college to become a pillar of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> bar and backer of liberal causes. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> lodged the same complaints Wednesday night at an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> forum, where he told 300 people, `` I was convicted before I was indicted. I was convicted by the American media.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> goes on trial Jan. 3 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on federal racketeering and conspiracy charges. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> is accused of taking payoffs from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other public officials. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was a fledgling defense contractor and favorite of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that collapsed in a bribery scandal in 1986. Joining <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> panel were <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political director who is appealing his conviction for illegal lobbying, and two reporters. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said he would not `` back one inch away'' from the media's First Amendment freedom, but that `` does not give them authority to desecrate the Sixth Amendment right: the presumption of innocence.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> resigned as attorney general last month, shortly before a special prosecutor decided not to indict him. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> claimed that special prosecutor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s only goal was to drive <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> from the attorney general's office, and `` I became an appropriate ... vehicle to help to accomplish that.'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, sentenced to 90 days in jail and a $ 30,000 fine for illegally lobbying former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues, said some reporters are careless, but he received fair coverage at his trial. `` You ca n't point a finger at the profession,'' he said. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Polk </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> both said the press had no power to indict or convict anyone. <PERSON> Polk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s problems stemmed from his indictment and the special But <PERSON> Polk </PERSON> said he personally feels the press `` has fostered an assumption of guilt on the part of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> before trial.'' Polk, who said juries often begin with the assumption that a defendant is guilty, also expressed the opinion that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> `` was unfairly convicted.''

 Most of the 1,000 or so people evacuated along the coast learned today they'd have to wait another day to return to their homes, swamped by a four-day torrent that swept away a motorist and drowned a toddler. `` We have to make sure everything is OK before we let people back in,'' <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Dralus </PERSON> said before some people were allowed to return this morning. `` There are water mocassins and there are gators because ponds have overflowed, and electricity and water definitely do n't mix.'' Much of the flooding in the <LOCATION> Bradenton-Palmetto </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> subsided by late morning, and most roads were declared passable and reopened. All schools that had been closed Wednesday were reopened today except for <ORGANIZATION> Bradenton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which had suffered water damage. The National Guard was put on alert Wednesday as residents bailed out from the 9 to 15 inches of rain that have fallen along the state's central <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> since Sunday, turning streets into rivers and spilling sewage into living rooms. It is the area's heaviest rain in a decade, surpassing the deluge that accompanied Hurricane <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> in 1985. `` We just can not handle all that rain,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Manatee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s drainage superintendant. `` It's the worst we've had in the 11 years I've been here. The rain fell from a near-stationary cold front hovering across the central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> peninsula. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> predicted that 4 more inches could fall today before the front slowly moved northeast. Showers and thunderstorms were also predicted today for southern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and coastal <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, but no other flood warnings were issued. Almost all low-lying areas were flooded in 10 <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay-area </LOCATION> counties. Most rivers were either flooded or forecast to reach flood stage. In <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, divers were still searching for <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>, 45, who disappeared in floodwaters after a car stalled in a drainage ditch and began to float. Three passengers were rescued by passersby. Witnesses saw <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> surface in the murky water, his arms flailing, but he was towed under by the strong current before rescuers could reach him, said <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. `` I feel certain that he is deceased, but we have n't found him,'' police Lt. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richey </LOCATION>, 2-year-old <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehm </PERSON> wandered behind his home and drowned in a rain-swelled canal, authorities said. At least 1,000 people in the region evacuated their homes, with some staying in shelters and others taking refuge in motels or with friends in less-soaked areas. The 350 people spending Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Manatee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s three <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelters were told they would not be allowed to return home until emergency officials declared the flood-damaged areas safe Nursing assistant <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, 32, grabbed a blanket and a toothbrush and spent Wednesday night in a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelter at <ORGANIZATION> Manatee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> after his <LOCATION> Bradenton </LOCATION> duplex was flooded out. `` The water was halfway up my calf and that was inside the house,'' <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said. `` Everything on the floor was pretty much ruined. The sewer backed up. In the house, it smells like a septic tank. I do n't want to go back.'' Water depths of 4 to 5 feet were common on streets before levels began dropping as the steady rain turned into a drizzle Wednesday afternoon. `` We had police officers in dump trucks patrolling the city,'' said City Councilman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Palmetto </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Manatee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bradenton </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> also opened three shelters in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> as floodwaters left cars in some sections of south <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> submerged to their windshields. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the bad weather was blamed for weakening the clay foundation under a 500-ton construction crane that toppled in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, trapping a 76-year-old woman in her car and pinning the crane's operator. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was in stable condition Wednesday night after being trapped more than an hour, and the operator was quickly freed, <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Sadie </PERSON> <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The Irish government refused entry to Jewish refugees from <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and was heavily influenced by its ambassador to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, who said the Jews were a source of corruption, according to a new book. `` <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> 1919-1949,'' by historian <PERSON> Dermot </PERSON> <PERSON> Keogh </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cork </PERSON>, cites previously secret state documents to show that the government regarded Jews as `` a potential irritant in the body politic'' who had `` disproportionate wealth and influence.'' The book, published Wednesday, says <PERSON> Eamon </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Valera </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> prime minister at the time, was advised by his ambassador to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bewley </PERSON>, a former ambassador to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and a Roman Catholic convert from Quakerism. He cites reports in the state archives in which <PERSON> Bewley </PERSON> blamed Jews for `` the appalling moral degradation'' of pre-Hitler <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and claimed that they creates `` grave moral scandals and are a source of corruption of the populations among which they dwell.'' <PERSON> Keogh </PERSON> writes that <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Valera </PERSON> did not share these views and frequently would `` deviate substantially'' from the policy. About 150 Jews from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were admitted temporarily, he says. But he also says de Valera rejected pleas from <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> Jewish leaders to give refuge to a German Jew who had jumped ship in <PERSON> Cork </PERSON> in 1939. The Jew ended up in a concentration camp, <PERSON> Keogh </PERSON> writes. He says there is evidence that government departments opposed any entry of Jews even after the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' extermination of Jews became known. The policy, he says, continued after the war. <PERSON> Keough </PERSON> quotes a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memorandum saying Jews should be treated less liberally under the immigration law because `` the wealth and influence of the Jewish community in this country appears to have increased considerably in recent years and there is some danger of exciting opposition and controversy if this tendency continues.'' Even in 1953, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memorandum referred to Jews as a people who `` appear to have disproportionate wealth and influence,'' <PERSON> Keogh </PERSON> writes. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, a country of 3.5 million, has about 1,900 Jews.

 Aspiring principals for the first time will not be required to have teaching experience, under a new state policy. Educators said the policy makes <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> the first state to open the principal's office to non-teachers. The plan, approved Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, increases standards for all candidates but drops a requirement of three years' teaching experience. The plan will allow the new principals to get teaching experience as they go. `` These new standards create a rigorous procedure for preparing all future principals and, at the same time, open up the system so that local districts can select the best potential candidates, regardless of background,'' Education Commissioner <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON> said in a statement after the board meeting in <LOCATION> Jamesburg </LOCATION>. Principals without education backgrounds will be designated as being part of a `` pilot project.'' It is to be reviewed by an independent panel in four years, <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatzkin </PERSON> said. During that period, the state will allow the hiring of no more than 50 new principals who lack teaching background, he said. The applicants will be required to have a master's degree in management, however. Principals with less than a year of teaching experience will have to teach one class period a day for at least a year, and candidates with less than a yer of teaching experience will have to teach for two years. In addition, they will be required to complete 135 hours of graduate study in education during their one - to two-year residency <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON> said the changes will give <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> schools a wider and better field from which to choose principals. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pipho </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> of the States, which follows school policies across the country, said he knows of no other state that allows non-teachers to be principals.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s latest trip to southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will take him to an impoverished region of refugees and rebels, but he will pointedly avoid segregated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the region's economic powerhouse.

He will go to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, countries that vehemently oppose <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but depend on it for economic survival. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> dominates communications, trade, transportation and politics in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and its influence will be felt strongly during the pope's 10-day trip. South African firms are supplying such items as transportation, food, water and health services, broadcasting and emergency equipment and even papal souvenirs to be used on many of the pope's stops <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, 68, has been critical of South African apartheid throughout his nearly 10-year-long pontificate. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said the pope has not refused to visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and he may visit in the future. `` But neither all the local bishops nor the pope himself consider this an opportune moment,'' he said. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said any <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> stopover during this visit would `` lose the pastoral tone of the trip.'' His trip will allow the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to explore new opportunities for the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> elsewhere in the region. Orthodox Marxism is weakening, and communist countries like <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> have decided to return confiscated church properties and to tolerate religious education. Catholicism has experienced its most rapid recent growth in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> plans to jump immediately into the troubled area with a keynote address Saturday evening to the bishops of the region, who are meeting in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>. Officials say about 6 million refugees have been displaced in the area by fierce fighting in the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colonies of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and regional conflicts in other southern African nations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been sponsoring peace talks on southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that would bring independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, a pullout of South African troops from that country and a gradual withdrawal of about 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. On the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> coast, a 13-year-old civil war in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> has turned into a disaster, devastating the countryside, halting agriculture and starving millions of people. It has caused a human tidal wave of almost 1 million refugees fleeing to camps in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The conflict pits the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> _ a group that says it is anti-communist _ against <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s Marxist government The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates 100,000 civilians have been killed in the past two years. Throughout his visit, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> will meet refugees and maimed victims of the regional conflicts. He also will visit the dioceses of <LOCATION> Gaborone </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manzini </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>, which are directly dependent on South African bishops. In <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, more than 1 million South Africans are expected to cross into the country when the pope beatifies French missionary <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> in a step toward sainthood. The king of <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, is Catholic, as is 40 percent of its 1.8 million population. The visit to <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest countries, is expected to be financed by South African donations. At his first stop in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> will be greeted by President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, a Jesuit-educated Marxist who often has spoken about his own Catholicism and who received church backing when he was fighting <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>'s white rulers in the 1970s. The church has spoken out against alleged atrocities by <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s soldiers in their conflict against dissidents once headed by <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>'s loyalists made peace last December and joined the government. In diamond-rich <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> early next week, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> will be greeted by President <PERSON> Quett </PERSON> <PERSON> Masire </PERSON>, who is recovering from injuries incurred when his plane was mistakenly shot down by Angolan troops while on his way a month ago to a conference in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. At midweek, the pope will be in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> for the religious centerpiece of the trip _ the beatification of Father <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON>, whose grave has become a pilgrimage site. After an eight-hour stop in <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> on Sept. 16 and a meeting with 20-year-old King <PERSON> Mswati </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the pope flies to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, where he will visit embattled <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION>, accompanied by the country's first cardinal, <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, who has urged government dialogue with the guerrillas. Because of guerrilla activity, access to <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION> is considered relatively safe only by air.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who has concentrated on Democrat-bashing in recent days, switched today to a detailed national defense speech touting the Strategic Defense Initiative and calling for repeal of the War Powers Act. The Republican vice presidential candidate, in remarks prepared for delivery to the City Club of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, also said that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies should share more of the cost of their own defense. On SDI, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` The next president should make every effort to determine whether he or his successor could develop and deploy a second red button _ not just the button of retaliation but the button of protection.'' The speech was designed to spotlight <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s experience as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He spoke in great detail on the justifications for SDI, popularly known as Star Wars, as well as other weapons systems and national security philosophy in general. He called for a cautious approach to U.S.-Soviet agreements. `` We must probe the Soviet position on START, working to conclude an agreement while modernizing our forces,'' he said. `` We must probe the Soviet position on conventional forces while continuing initiatives to strengthen our conventional force posture. And we must probe Soviet willingness to restrain their clients and to determine whether Soviet ` new thinking' will in fact lead to behavior that can lower the possibilities for regional conflicts,'' he said in the prepared statement. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s text did not mention Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whom he has heatedly attacked as being weak on defense in recent days. He attacked congressional `` interference in the president's ability to conduct foreign policy. He said the War Powers Act `` is unconstitutional and should be repealed or drastically rewritten.'' The act, enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1973 over President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s veto, is a Vietnam-era law limiting a president's ability to commit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to dangerous situations The law says a president must send a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> within 48 hours after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are sent to areas of `` imminent hostilities.'' The forces would have to be withdrawn in 60 days, in some cases, unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> votes to permit them to stay. All presidents since <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> have argued the law is an unconstitutional restriction on the executive branch. There is widespread criticism _ from <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> alike _ that the law is unworkable and there is now a bipartisan push to rewrite the law, although there is not yet agreement on details. On Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> got a warm welcome from his colleagues his first day back on the job since becoming <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, but the message from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was mixed at best. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as `` a rising young star in our party'' at a Capitol reception, but later he stopped short of calling <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> an asset to the Republican ticket when pressed by reporters. `` I think he's becoming an asset,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. Did that mean the senator thought <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had achieved that status yet, he was asked. `` Becoming,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> repeated. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> colleagues, `` I ca n't wait to get back out there'' on the campaign trail. There were cheers from the senators as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spoke, some of them calling out, `` Hear, Hear!'' `` No matter what happens in this election, the people who know me best and the people I am closest to are the people right here in this room,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I hope you never forget. Believe me, I'll never forget.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he would return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for key <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes as he was needed. `` I know you've been on a roller coaster ride,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said as he welcomed the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator back after a summer recess in which <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> became the party's vice presidential nominee. Since his nomination, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been dogged by controversies over his military service, personal life and academic record, and some in his own party have expressed skepticism about whether the 41-year-old senator should be on the ticket. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, a onetime presidential hopeful who was on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s short list of vice presidential prospects, has himself expressed reservations about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said recently that people of his generation might have problems with allegations that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> used his wealthy family's influence to get into the National Guard during the Vietnam War. He repeated that view after the reception Wednesday, telling reporters, `` If he did get certain breaks ... that would create a problem in the minds of many, particularly, I would say, in my generation.'' At the reception, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> with a small fire extinguisher, which he said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> could `` spray on the press from time to time.'' He also gave <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> a framed copy of the Pledge of Allegiance. The Republicans have criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, for vetoing a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> bill that would have required teachers to lead students in the pledge. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> devoted his Labor Day fall campaign kickoff speech to the pledge.

 A judge has ordered a trial to decide who owns the papers of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> _ his widow or <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In a ruling received by lawyers today, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said a letter by King bequeathing the papers to BU is not a formal will and therefore <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> has the right to a trial on her claim to the documents. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> ruled that <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> was the rightful holder of the papers at the time of King's death in 1968, but he said Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> also has the right to stake a claim. One issue in the trial, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said, will be whether her 23-year delay in making a claim strengthens the university's case. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> rejected a counterclaim by <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> to ownership of King papers stored in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The decision was dated Aug. 31. At issue is the collection of 83,000 documents entrusted to BU by King in 1964, four years before he was assassinated in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> sued in December after negotiations over her bid to reclaim the papers broke down. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> wants to consolidate the papers with 100,000 other King documents at the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Central to the case is a one-page, typewritten letter dated July 16, 1964, from King to the BU library. King, who received his doctorate in theology from <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> in 1955, wrote that the library would be `` the repository of my correspondence, manuscripts and other papers.'' `` In the event of my death,'' he wrote, `` all such materials deposited with the university shall become from that date the absolute property of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>, however, claims her husband had privately indicated his wish that the archive be stored permanently in the South.

 Some 200 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> disciples of <PERSON> Bhagwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shree </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON> are expected for a weekend reunion at their former central <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> commune, a spokesman for the Indian guru said. State police patrols are being increased in anticipation. `` We are not expecting trouble. We plan on being prepared for trouble if it occurs,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said Wednesday. But the reunion is `` just what we're calling it, a reunion,'' said <PERSON> Swami </PERSON> <PERSON> Anand </PERSON> <PERSON> Vibhavan </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Rajneesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION>. The reunion, by invitation only, will be on private property at the 64,000-acre Rancho <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON> and will be closed to the public except for a news conference Sunday by <PERSON> Swami </PERSON> <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Niren </PERSON>, the guru's attorney who now carries the title of <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> When the commune was its most active, thousands of red-clad disciples lived on the ranch, incorporated as <LOCATION> Rajneeshpuram </LOCATION>. There, they showered the self-proclaimed `` rich man's guru'' with Rolls-Royces and jewelry. The sect members spent a turbulent 4 -LCB- years at the commune that were marked by confrontations with non-believers. Rajneeshees took over the nearby town of <LOCATION> Antelope </LOCATION> and later, in an alleged bid for political control of the county, bused in thousands of transients as potential voters. Sect members boycotted the election and deposited the transients in nearby communities after state officials required eligibility hearings for all new voter registration applicants. <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON>'s feisty personal secretary, <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Anand </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheela </PERSON>, is in federal prison on a variety of convictions stemming from her conduct at the commune. Among other crimes, she was convicted of poisoning salad bars in nearby The <LOCATION> Dalles </LOCATION>, causing more than 750 people to become ill; giving glasses of poisoned water to county officials, and setting fire to the county planning office. <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON>, 56, returned to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1985 after pleading guilty to federal immigration charges. As part of a plea agreement, he received a suspended 10-year sentence, paid a $ 400,000 fine and agreed not to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for five years without the written permission of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general. He now lectures and meditates at a commune in <LOCATION> Pune </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The commune disbanded after the guru's departure. The property is scheduled for auction next month under foreclosure proceedings. <LOCATION> Wasco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> residents have expressed concern about the weekend gathering, but <PERSON> Sheriff </PERSON> <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Labrousse </PERSON> said he expects no trouble. `` We're just going to be business as usual,'' he said.

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 25th annual National Championship Air Races next week are expected to attract record crowds despite the tragic crash into a German air show audience. The possibility of a similar disaster is remote here because of strict <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and air race rules, according to <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> <PERSON> Audrain </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Reno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The planes are not allowed to fly toward the crowd,'' he said Wednesday. `` In fact, they are only allowed to fly parallel to and away from the crowd. We've always been very safety conscious and have never had any spectators injured.'' Eight participants have been killed, however. <PERSON> Audrain </PERSON> said he expects attendance this year to at least match the record 148,000 who flocked to Stead Airport 10 miles north of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> in 1987. Time trials for the various classes of airplanes begin Monday, and the races are Sept. 15-18. A record field of nearly 120 entrants is expected to compete at speeds of up to more than 450 mph for a total purse of $ 450,000, according to race officials. Entrants range from independently wealthy flying buffs to corporate sponsored pilots. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thunderbirds </ORGANIZATION> also are scheduled to demonstrate their precision moves, and stunt pilots will entertain between races. `` People expect the stunt flying. It's part of the show,'' Audrain said. At <ORGANIZATION> Ramstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, more than 50 people died after three jets from an Italian military precision flying team collided at an air show Aug. 28 and one hurtled into a crowd of spectators, exploding into a fireball. `` That type of maneuver would never be permitted under our rules,'' Audrain said. `` It would have to be a very, very unusual circumstance for the audience to be at risk at all. I just do n't see it happening `` We have insurance, although that would n't prevent an accident,'' he added. The air races began in 1964 with 24 entrants competing for a purse of $ 31,774. Since 1966, the event has attracted many of the best racers and stunt fliers in the world. The eight participant deaths during the history of the race included one just last year, a pilot whose plane crashed after an apparent engine malfunction. `` We have had some deaths associated with the races, but all in all we've had a very good safety record,'' Audrain said. `` Some things you just ca n't prevent, but with the strict <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rules, we think we're as safe as you can get.''

 The 1.9 million-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> endorsed presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Thursday, with its chief predicting the Democrat would spend more on schools and end `` eight years of teacher bashing.'' <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said she aims to `` mobilize at least a half-million <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> members to be volunteers in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign.'' The union sent out mail ballots to the 8,479 delegates who attended its last convention, and got responses from about 6,200. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the choice of 86 percent; the other 14 percent marked their ballots for Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Four years ago, 88 percent backed <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in an up-down vote on the Democratic nominee. The NEA did not show <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on its ballot that year. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, joined by <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference she looks forward to `` substantial increases in federal funding for public education'' in a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration. She said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will `` work side by side with the education community to improve American education'' and expressed confidence that he will `` redirect national priorities and provide substantial increases in federal funding for public education.'' `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as president, would put an end to eight years of teacher bashing and budget cutting,'' she said, and `` appoint an education secretary who would fight for education instead of trashing it.'' `` I think that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will go down as the administration with the worst educational record probably in the history of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>. The union has been encamped in the Democrats' corner in every presidential race since 1976. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said 30 percent, or nearly 600,000, of her members are registered Republicans. But in rejecting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, she said, teachers were signalling that `` they are tired of being beaten on the head, tired of being told to do more with less.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> belatedly replied to an NEA political questionnaire two weeks ago, a year late and long after the ballots went out.

 Discovery's astronauts completed a successful practice countdown aboard the spaceship today, the last major test before they lift off in as little as three weeks on the first shuttle mission in 2 -LCB- years, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. The space agency on Wednesday plans to announce a launch date after assessing the countdown test and other factors. Officials have been discussing a date between Sept. 26 and 29. `` We clearly demonstrated that we're ready to pick up the count for real; I hope that we will be able to do that by the end of the month,'' Kennedy Space Center Director <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> told the launch team after the test. `` It certainly sets the stage for what we're about ready to do here in just a few weeks,'' launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> added. Commander <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> and his four crewmates, wearing new partial pressure suits, switched dials, tested communications, monitored systems and followed all procedures scheduled during the final two hours of an actual countdown. `` Everything appears to have gone quite well,'' said launch control commentator <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as the test concluded at 10:34 a.m., 34 minutes behind schedule because of minor communications problems between the craft and control center. The countdown clock was halted at six seconds before the mock liftoff to simulate an engine problem and give the launch team practice in making the vehicle safe. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said that had this been an actual launch attempt, the effort would have been delayed because winds of about 19 mph were too high. Because it was a practice, launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> gave the go-ahead to complete the count. `` It all looks clean; it all looks good,'' <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said after an inspection of Discovery on Tuesday. `` We're going to be ready to fly.'' The other crewmen are pilot <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>. On most previous shuttle launches, the astronauts wore flight coveralls. The partial pressure suits, to be worn on launch and re-entry, would be necessary in case of trouble during an emergency landing attempt and the crew had to bail out by blowing an explosive hatch, sliding down a telescoping pole and parachuting to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The emergency escape system has been added since the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion that killed the seven-member crew and grounded the shuttle fleet. It would not help in a Challenger-type accident in which the vehicle blew apart 73 seconds after liftoff. The practice countdown concludes three days of training here for the astronauts, after which they return to their base at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to await a launch day announcement next week. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is aiming for a liftoff in the last week in September, but has deferred setting a firm date until Sept. 14, following a two-day flight readiness review here. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said he and Lounge would represent the crew at the review. `` That is an in-depth review that all elements of the program will have a requirement to sign on the dotted line to say that their part of the program is ready for us to fly,'' he told reporters Wednesday. Asked if he saw anything that would prevent a late September launch, the commander replied, `` I have n't seen anything.'' He said there were a few open technical issues, but he did not consider any of them serious. The astronauts met reporters Tuesday following a three-hour launch pad exercise in which they inspected Discovery and the communications satellite in its cargo bay and walked through a rehearsal of emergency escape procedures. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> commanded Discovery in November 1984 on one of the ship's six earlier flights The four other crewmen also are veteran shuttle fliers.

<HEAD>Leftist Insurgency Could Lead To Civil War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSE GONZALES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Centuries of hate and discrimination between <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s rich and poor have spawned a vicious leftist insurgency that could lead to civil war, the head of a blue-ribbon <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel on violence warned Thursday. `` Either we make a concerted effort at a national plan for pacification ... or face the possibility of a country caught in a civil war,'' Sen. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernales </PERSON> said in making public the commission's report. Poverty, racism and government corruption are other major causes of the eight-year insurrection of the <ORGANIZATION> Maoist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, said the study, conducted by a panel of 11 senators. `` Political violence in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is not the result of poverty alone but of humiliation, oppression, hate between classes, racism,'' <PERSON> Bernales </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bernales </PERSON> said the 389-page report, which probes the roots of violence and offers possible solutions, is the most extensive of its kind ever undertaken in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. The commission said the white ruling class has maintained the subjugation of Indian peasants in the Andean highlands first begun by Spanish conquerors and continued by the aristocracy. It said the peasants, who make up about 40 percent of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s population, are the most uneducated, impoverished and ignored sector of society and are frequent objects of scorn `` This has become an intolerable humiliation. They are being pushed to the border and are questioning the existing order. Violence has resulted,'' the report said. The commission, which used government and private studies in its findings, said 11,605 people have been killed and property damage has reached $ 10 billion in the Maoist revolt. The panel said that the economy also has deteriorated dramatically. `` The country is in the same situation as it was 15 years ago. It has lost all movement toward developing,'' said <PERSON> Bernales </PERSON>. Mounting problems have sparked an exodus of skilled workers and professionals. The report said 125,000 Peruvians emigrated in the past four years, about half to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In a nationwide survey, which sampled residents of the terror-ridden mountain states of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Huancavelica </LOCATION> for the first time ever, the commission found 60 percent of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s 20 million people believe the government has been ineffective in dealing with terrorism. The commission said the insurgency, repressive countermeasures by government forces and drug trafficking have sparked political instability and undermined participation in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s democracy. About 300,000 Peruvian families are linked to narcotics trafficking, according to the study. The peasants grow coca, the raw material of cocaine, on small jungle plots for their livelihood. The Shining Path recently opened a new front in the coca-growing zone. The commission urged greater efforts be made toward feasible crop substitution programs. It also urged government forces to reject illegal tactics in dealing with guerrillas. `` The state and society must stay within the law in defending itself,'' said <PERSON> Bernales </PERSON>. The states of emergency to counter rebels, now in effect in seven states where more than 40 percent of the population lives, should be phased out to strengthen respect for democracy, the commission said. The panel recommended a national consensus be reached quickly on how to resist the guerrillas, and it urged radical changes in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s rigid class structure. The commission also proposed that police and the military undergo training in respecting human rights.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge was confronted Thursday with conflicting arguments over whether to let <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers complete a partial merger approved last month by then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, attorney for a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> group of readers and advertisers opposed to the arrangement, accused owners of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and the Detroit News of cutting prices to put each other out of business or eventually qualify for a lucrative joint operating agreement under the Newspaper Preservation Act. But a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Millet </PERSON>, said there was `` absolutely no evidence'' that the two newspapers had colluded. The arrangement approved by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> before he left office would allow the morning <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to merge its commercial and business operations with the News, bought in 1986 by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has threatened to close the Free Press, which has sustained $ 100 million in losses in nine years, if the partial merger is not allowed to proceed The deal was temporarily blocked by court order last month to give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> a chance to consider the legal challenge by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Citizens </LOCATION> for a Free Press. <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> said he would rule next week on the group's request for an injunction barring the merger. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> group of readers and advertisers charges that the two newspapers set out to try to put each other out of business by cutting advertising and circulation rates or to qualify for a joint operating agreement. `` <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy was to sustain short-term losses with its eye on very long-term profits'' under a joint operating agreement allowed by the law's anti-trust exemption, <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision to allow the partial merger was arbitrary because he ignored the administrative law judge's conclusion that if the merger were not approved, the News, which has also posted significant losses, would eventually raise its prices, thereby allowing the Free Press to do the same <PERSON> Millet </PERSON> said `` there was absolutely no evidence of collusion'' between the Free Press and the News, which was not acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> until several months before the merger application was made in 1986. `` The fact that these two papers considered the option and discused this over a period of time is not an argument that a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> should n't occur,'' <PERSON> Millet </PERSON> said. Such discussions were a `` natural consequence'' of the losses the two papers continued to suffer while waging the cutthroat newspaper war, he said. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, an attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>, said the News rejected several overtures from the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> about forming a joint operating agreement. `` The News' answer was always: ` There is the door. Good-bye.''' said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, an elder statesmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> director. While the Free Press was locked in bitter competition with the News, `` every year except one, they lost more money than they lost the year before,'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said 2200 jobs would be lost if the Free Press closed its doors, compared to 600 to 800 lost positions under the proposed merger. In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> had a circulation of 639,720 daily and 724,342 on Sundays.

<HEAD>Korea Urged to Release Political Prisoners, End Torture</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has made significant improvements in human rights as it prepares to host the Olympics, but the government still holds 600 political prisoners and tortures some of them, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The human rights group said in a report that some political prisoners were jailed after unfair trials but that torture has decreased. Government sensitivity to world attention during the Sept. 17 to Oct. 2 Olympics may help improve the situation, but the Games do not guarantee changes, a representative of the London-based group said. `` The limits of freedom of expression have expanded ... the atmosphere is remarkably more free than before,'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> researcher <PERSON> Francoise </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandale </PERSON> said at a briefing on the report, entitled `` Detention of Prisoners of Conscience and Torture Continue.'' The report said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> should release more political prisoners, end torture and ill-treatment of detainees, and change laws to allow peaceful expression of opposition to the government. Major political changes since last summer have ushered in some improvements in human rights, the report noted. The government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo came to power after <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, then chairman of the governing party, pledged democratic reforms, including release of political prisoners, in response to violent demonstrations in June 1987. National Assembly elections last April gave the opposition a majority, a startling change for a country long ruled by a party with almost complete power. The assembly is debating several changes in laws on national security and demonstrations, and <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> called for amendments `` to exclude from their scope peaceful acts of opposition to the government.'' The changes have given political prisoners limited hope. `` There have been releases and amnesties but we think they've been too few,'' Ms. <PERSON> Vandale </PERSON> said. The government says nearly 1,300 political prisoners have been released since last year, but <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> says the number is only 400. The organization also said 4,000 former political prisoners' civil rights have been restored in this period, about half the number claimed by the government `` Arrests on political grounds have continued,'' with about 600 people imprisoned for political or trade union activities, the report said. Of these, about one-third have been convicted, as far back as 1958, for anti-state activities such as espionage, and given sentences from five years to life. Another one-third were arrested during nationwide strikes in 1987, and the rest are thought to be students arrested in the past year during anti-government demonstrations. Among the 600, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> is calling for the release of 28 it has adopted as prisoners of conscience, and it is investigating the cases of another 70. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> defines prisoners of conscience as those `` detained for belief, color, sex, ethnic origin, language or religion provided they have n't used or advocated violence.'' Students who threw rocks in demonstrations could not be considered, an official said. Constitutional amendments have strenthened laws protecting prisoners' rights, but `` in practice these rights are still not always respected,'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. It said relatives and lawyers have been denied access to any information about detainees, and prisoners have been isolated, beaten and deprived of sleep in the first days after their arrest. The group has not heard of water torture cases since several instances in the last two years in which police were arrested for torture or abuse of a detainee. Asked if <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> felt the government was making changes with the Olympics in mind, the researcher said, `` I suppose the government is sensitive to its political image, but I believe the release of political prisoners has more to do with the balance of political parties.'' She said that in the long term, `` of course the attention of the whole world matters ... but things have changed very quickly in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. We just do n't know what might happen after -LRB- the Games. -RRB-''

 About 60 Panamanian refugees were stranded here Thursday after the Canadian government abruptly began demanding entry visas for travelers from that strife-torn nation, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration official said. `` These people do not want to return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ they have made that clear,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, district director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> here, said Thursday. <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said that among the Panamanians are more than 20 children. The Panamanians were housed overnight by the airlines, and on Thursday were given temporary permission to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> until their situation is revolved, he said. `` It all rests with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said. `` That policy should not have been changed in <LOCATION> midstream </LOCATION>.'' He said he had requested the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to complain to <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> officials about the situation. On Wednesday, Canadian Immigration Minister <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> McDougall </PERSON> announced that, effective immediately, Panamanians could no longer enter the country with only a valid passport. She said the visa requirement was necessary to preserve the integrity of the Canadian immigration system, adding that 1,600 Panamanians have asked for refugee status this year. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been wracked with political and economic turmoil since its military ruler, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, was indicted for drug trafficking in February. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has declared a financial embargo against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in a so-far unsuccessful effort to topple <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government. The stranded Panamanians arrived on <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> flights in the past two days with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> transit visas, which ordinarily would allow them to stay only long enough to catch another flight on to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. But they were informed that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> now demands entry visas for Panamanians, and were prohibited from boarding flights to that country. He said that an additional 15 Panamanians were stranded in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. So far, the Panamanians stranded here have expressed no desire to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> permanently, <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said. Should the situation drag out, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, which usually refuses to change transit visas to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> entry visas, might make an exception, <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said. `` I would have to weigh the implications,'' he said.

 Wind gusts to 85 mph fanned forest fires that gutted 17 buildings near Old Faithful, while two <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> men reported missing after flames engulfed their home were found today. `` Trees were just popping like matchsticks,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a firefighter from <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` There were winds at least 85 mph.'' Temperatures here dropped into the 30s and winds died down overnight, and firefighters expected calmer weather through Saturday. Forecasters said a storm could bring rain or snow over the weekend. Wildfires also forced the evacuations of 50 homes in the Shoshone National Forest in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and two dozen homes and a Boy Scout camp near <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. Fire crews continued to protect two <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> towns near <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> from a huge fire, and battled blazes in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> In northwest <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> Flathead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, authorities had feared that a man and his brother were caught in the flames after refusing an evacuation order. But the men were found this morning along the river corridor bordering Glacier National Park. `` They have been located and they are all right,'' said <PERSON> Madelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kempf </PERSON>, fire information officer. Although federal officials have called this the worst fire season in 30 years, no fatalities have been directly attributed to the blazes, which have charred 3.65 million acres, an area larger than <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. Last month, a helicopter involved in battling a blaze in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> crashed after losing power, killing a passenger, a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> technician. Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, R-Wyo., and others have criticized the Park Service for waiting too long to fight some of the fires because of a policy to allow fires in wilderness areas to burn for the benefits they bring to forests Wallop met Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> and urged <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, to resign. The northwest <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> blaze, discovered Tuesday, expanded to an estimated 7,500 acres by early today and moved into <LOCATION> Glacier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where it burned a ranger station complex and numerous cabins. Four hikers near the park's <ORGANIZATION> Lower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quartz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> were rescued by helicopter Wednesday afternoon after flames cut off their escape route and they drove their vehicle into the lake to save it. More than 100 people who live in the area were evacuated, and two park campgrounds were evacuated. At <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, tourist <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> was one of more than 100 visitors who left the Old Faithful area in a convoy led by rangers Wednesday night as embers from the nearby 221,800-acre North Fork fire descended. `` I've been coming up here a long time,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` Thank God I've got a lot of pictures of the way the park was, because I'll never see it like that again.'' The fire is one of 13 major blazes covering more than 1 million acres in and around the 2.2 million-acre park. Earlier, flames destroyed two cabins in the complex's southern end, while embers carried by the winds ignited 14 guest cabins and a utility shed at the main part of the complex, said Fire Commander <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON>. But because the fire exhausted fuel as it passed through, officials did not expect to see similar damaging flames again. About 200 firefighters protected other structures, including the historic <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Faithful </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inn </LOCATION>, where a sprinkler line on the roof was activated. Firefighters also sprayed flame-retardant foam on the roof. Overnight visitors to Old Faithful were asked to leave Wednesday morning. It was the first-ever evacuation of the most popular tourist attraction at the 116-year-old park in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s northwest corner. But park officials admitted day visitors until late Wednesday afternoon, when stiff winds whipped up a blaze on the area's southern border and blew embers into the complex, igniting roofs of buildings `` When that firestorm went through there, we had to move our people out of there,'' <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said. `` When you can feel the heat inside your car, it's time to move.'' East of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, Shoshone forest officials evacuated at least 50 ranches and summer homes in a sparsely populated area because of rapid growth of the 260,000-acre Clover Mist fire. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said a storm front could carry significant rain or even snow for <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> this weekend, providing relief. Along Yellowstone's northern border, high winds drove a backfire along the northern edge of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and nearby Silver Gate. The fire singed the fringes of the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> towns but created a buffer of charred timber in advance of the 119,000-acre Storm Creek-Hellroaring fire. `` Now, with the fuels burned out, at least on this side of the valley, there wo n't be anything left to burn,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalker </PERSON>, a fire information officer. However, officials remained concerned that winds could shift and drive the main fire into dry, unburned timber south of the canyon towns by this weekend. The blaze remained about a mile from the towns Wednesday, officials said. Firefighters sprayed foam on buildings in <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, 2 -LCB- miles east of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and saved about 40 structures before the searing flames drove crews out.

The couples, <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> and <PERSON> Olive </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>, were scheduled to go on trial Monday. The Feb. 12 indictment accused them of committing a series of crimes in the Coeur d'Alene area in August and September 1986 aimed at advancing their white-supremacist group, <ORGANIZATION> Bruder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schweigen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> II, or Order II. Besides raising money to finance its operations, the group sought to kill or intimidate opponents of their offshoot of the Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> Christian-Aryan Nations, prosecutors said. They were accused of bombing an auto restoration shop, the home of a priest who was a leader in anti-hate group activity, and the federal building <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION>. Prosecutors alleged the explosions were part of an aborted plan to rob a bank and a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> armory. All four pleaded guilty to racketeering or engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise from 1984 to 1987. Some also pleaded guilty to firearms or explosives charges or counterfeiting. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> approved an agreement with prosecutors that <PERSON> Dorr </PERSON> be sentenced to no more than 20 years in prison, Mrs. <PERSON> Dorr </PERSON> to no more than eight years, <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> to no more than 12 years and Mrs. <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> no more than a suspended six-year term. He scheduled sentencing for Oct. 26. A fifth defendant, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pires </PERSON>, has pleaded guilty to charges including a 1986 slaying and bombings and attempted bombings in <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pires </PERSON> was sentenced to 25 years in prison and has been cooperating with prosecutors.

 Like mammoth Roman candles, rocket motors from two <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> nuclear missiles were burned today, becoming the first of 867 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles to be destroyed under the U.S.-Soviet intermediate-range arms treaty. Hundreds of people, including Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a team of Soviet inspectors, watched the static firing, in which the motors were bolted into a concrete and steel structure, ignited and allowed to burn up their fuel. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used binoculars to watch the first 50-second firing at the 8,500-acre <ORGANIZATION> Longhorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>. The first Pershing 2 motor burned at 10 a.m., followed 15 minutes later by a 40-second burning of a lighter Pershing 1A. `` This is the day that the two nuclear powers began to move toward a safer world,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Col. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chabalin </PERSON>, a senior <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> inspector, said through an interpreter: `` We think it is a great event for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people, the reduction of two types of nuclear weapons. And today we have witnessed the fulfillment of a significant event in the elimination of these weapons under the treaty.'' `` This is the first elimination of such <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles under the INF treaty anywhere, worldwide,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> spokeswoman for the On-site <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, established to help carry out the arms treaty. `` It's interesting,'' said a member of the 12-person Soviet team, <PERSON> Andire </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krutskikh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We have a lot to do, though.'' A small group of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> presidential supporters and other protesters, one of whom carried a sign saying Texans for a Sane Demilitarization, lined the drive to the arsenal's front gate. `` The Soviets watch the motors' static firing to eliminate the rocket propellant in the motor,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Karnack </LOCATION>, a civilian employee with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Redstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION>. `` We must then physically disable the rocket motor so the motor casing could not be reloaded and reused again,'' he said. `` We're going to do that in a car crusher, squash them in a car crusher. The Soviets arrived here Wednesday. The treaty allows up to 20 such observers. `` There's a cast of thousands behind this thing, including many ambassadors, with people from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>,'' said Longhorn spokeswoman <PERSON> Joann </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` It's exciting.'' Ms. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said that about nine more rocket motors were scheduled to be eliminated in the following week at <LOCATION> Longhorn </LOCATION>, which is 170 miles east of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Officials also will destroy <PERSON> Pershings </PERSON> and their launchers at Pueblo Depot Activity near <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, Colo, and <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> launchers will be eliminated in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The treaty also provides for destruction of ground-launched cruise missiles and their launchers at <ORGANIZATION> Davis-Monthan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>. The treaty became effective this summer and requires the superpowers to dismantle and destroy their intermediate - and shorter-range nuclear missiles The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 867 ground-launched cruise and <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> missiles scheduled for destruction. As of Aug. 30, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> destroyed 22 medium and 50 shorter range missiles. It must destroy a total of 1,752 SS-4, SS-12 and SS-20 missiles under the treaty.

 A congressman asked a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Thursday to toughen a bill aimed at resuming the availability of federal land for municipal landfills in the West. Without amendments, the bill under consideration leaves the government `` not doing its fair share to clean up,'' Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., told the national parks and public lands subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Federal land controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> has been leased and sold outright for landfills to hundreds of cities, towns and counties at below-market prices since 1954. The leases and deeds have contained clauses requiring a return to federal ownership if the land is used for purposes not stated in the lease. This could leave the federal government liable for cleanup if hazardous materials are found in the landfills, even though those materials may have been placed there during municipal operation of the site. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burford </PERSON>, director of the bureau, told the subcommittee the liability was potentially `` enormous,'' but he had no figures. Because of this potential, he suspended new deals in February 1987. Bureau spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he did not know how many cities and counties wanted landfills, `` but there is certainly interest.'' `` The maintenance of a waste disposal site facility and cleanup of a hazardous waste site are more properly the responsibility of the local and state governments and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, respectively,'' <PERSON> Burford </PERSON> said. Without regular municipal landfills, `` people are going to find a place'' to put their garbage illegally, he said. The environment subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, chaired by <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, said in a report last year that the bureau was ignoring <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s guidelines for landfill operations that federal agencies are obliged to follow, even such provisions as requiring fences. `` Both the delinquent operator and the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION>, by their failure to act, are responsible for the mess,'' <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said. `` Now, if <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> just passes ownership of the sites off to local jurisdictions, it is not doing its fair share to clean up.'' Also, he said, `` To apportion the costs and responsibilities of any future cleanup, <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> needs to know the condition of the site when it leaves federal ownership.'' <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> urged the subcommittee to require rigorous inspection before any land transfers. `` Contaminated land should not be transferred until the federal government has taken corrective action to eliminate the hazards,'' he said, urging that the bill require new owners to agree to abide by all federal and state hazardous waste regulations. There are now 336 active sites subject to the reversion provision. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that 1,000 to 3,000 sites on its lands have been used for municipal waste disposal in the past. There are 37 federally provided landfills in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, 54 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 16 in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, 41 in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, three in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 44 in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, 51 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 19 in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, 35 in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and 36 in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. The bill would not disturb any federal liability for existing hazardous waste, even if not discovered yet. However, it would enable the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary to lease or sell land in new transactions without reversion requirements if the land is to be used for municipal landfills or `` any purpose which may result in the release of hazardous wastes,'' <PERSON> Burford </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> has suspended operations at 94 sites, but <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, the bureau's hazardous waste specialist, said the agency has no idea how many sites may contain hazardous waste. One site in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has been proposed for the priority cleanup list for the `` Superfund'' toxic waste cleanup program run by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, although federal sites may not receive Superfund money, <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said. Inspections are under way at 45 sites, and about a third of those have been determined to require no action, he added.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' image as a decisive leader has declined in the past month while <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s has improved, costing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> support among independent voters, a national poll released Thursday said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was supported by 50 percent of all likely voters in the Business Week poll, to 44 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. That was a reversal of their standings in a survey for the magazine done Aug. 4-9, before the Republican National Convention. The new poll of 1,299 likely voters had a margin of error of three percentage points, putting the race at a statistical dead heat. However, based on the underlying movement to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` We feel he's clearly ahead at this point,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krane </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which conducts the Business Week polls. The 50-44 margin in the survey was similar to a 51-43 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll released Wednesday. The ABC-Post poll was done Aug. 31 through Tuesday; Business Week's, Sept. 1 through Tuesday. Both polls were conducted in part during the Labor Day weekend, when many people are not home and samples may be less representative. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> warned that its results `` should be interpreted cautiously.'' <PERSON> Krane </PERSON> said he did not believe the Business Week poll had sampling problems. Respondents to the survey expressed some concerns with both candidates. They split evenly on whether <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` too soft on crime'' and said by a 63-28 percent margin he is too inexperienced in foreign affairs. On the other hand, they said by 51-42 percent that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` demonstrated poor judgment in the way he picked Senator <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate,'' and agreed by 62-27 that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is too willing to defend policies of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, such as the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms deal, whether they worked or not.'' Asked who is the more decisive leader, 46 percent picked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 40 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In the August poll, it was 50 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to 39 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The remainder were not sure. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had the support of most Republicans and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was favored by most Democrats, as in August. But then independents were split, 49 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 46 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>; in the new poll they went for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 54-39. The August poll put the race overall at 51 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to 45 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wants to use a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> visit later this month to hold individual talks with allied leaders, but is not trying to set up a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> summit, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today. Deluged with questions about a series of stories suggesting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was trying to get world leaders together, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president merely had invited the leaders of delegations to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session to see him while he is in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Saying the president will travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Sept. 26 and address the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> the next morning, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that news accounts suggesting a summit was being attempted were incorrect. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> called one such account `` wildly inaccurate.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, answering questions at the daily <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news briefing, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will `` hold a number of meetings with heads of delegations, some on a bilateral basis and some in larger groups.'' He confirmed previous reports that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had invited the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to meet with him in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to discuss sagging <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace prospects. `` In addition the president will meet with foreign ministers or heads of state from several other countries during the visit,'' the spokesman said. `` We're not prepared to announce any specific meetings at this time. However, there are erroneous reports ... of a so-called meeting of industrialized nations, and that story is false.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that `` undoubtedly the president will meet either informally or at lunch and for dinners with representatives from several countries'' but said that none of these meetings `` can be construed as summits.'' `` What's happened is, the president's having a number of meetings and we have, of course, extended invitations to a number of heads of delegations for those meetings,'' he said. `` In some cases, a head of state intends to be the head of the delegation, and in many cases, it will be the foreign minister.'' `` I think what's happening is we have sent the invitations, those countries are reporting it, and then in the process it gets labeled slightly incorrectly,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> today, the office of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had asked him to meet Sept. 27 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and that the invitation was still `` under study.'' A spokeswoman at the <ORGANIZATION> Elysee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with the practice on these matters, said she did not know which other leaders had been invited, but understood that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would be represented by its foreign minister. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> already is scheduled to meet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 29. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s office said there had been `` a communication'' on the matter to which Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has not yet responded. A spokesman for the prime minister, requesting anonymity, said she had no plans to be in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in September. He noted that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has accepted an invitation extended by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in May to visit him in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after the election and to meet with whoever wins the election.

 Schools and libraries face growing pressure to censor the books children read, according to a report released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION>. `` Pressures that could result in censorship are increasing, and that has an adverse effect on the ability of the schools to provide a broad-based education for children, who will be our future leaders,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Krug </PERSON>, director of the association's office for intellectual freedom. This pressure comes from people who want to impose their views on the educational system by removing or restricting use of certain materials, according to the report, `` Censorship and Selection: Issues and Answers for Schools.'' The study was published jointly by the administrators group and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Over the past five years the number of challenges to library books and school materials increased by 168 percent, the groups said. In many cases, the study says, those seeking to censor materials see themselves as living in a hostile world, surrounded by enemies ... `` people whose world is filled with ` oughts' and ` shoulds' and any indication that other people are freer in their decision-making processes arouses in them severe feelings of anxiety and resentment.'' It is essential that schools reach out to these people before controversy can arise, the report suggests. Cited as a possible solution was one case where parents, who had heard reports of questionable material in some school books, were invited to the school to read and discuss the books in question. The teachers learned things from the parents, while the parents got to understand the books and came to trust the teachers, the report said.

<HEAD>Vincennes Skipper Was Told Iranian Plane Might Be Airliner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three minutes before he ordered missiles fired at the Iranian plane approaching his ship July 3, the skipper of the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged `` with a wave of his hand'' an officer's warning that it might be a commercial airliner, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. The warning was called out by one of the officers in the confused combat information center of the sophisticated warship, but `` other factors'' prompted Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> to order two missiles fired at the jet in the mistaken belief that it was an F-14 fighter, according to Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Flight 655, an A-300 Airbus, was destroyed and all 290 people aboard were killed. <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that an unidentified officer standing behind <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> called out `` possible comm air -LRB- commercial aircraft -RRB-,'' and <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> acknowledged the warning with `` a wave of his hand.'' But <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was swayed by factors including its takeoff from a military-civilian airfield, its failure to respond to warnings from the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, and the mistaken beliefs that it was outside a commercial air corridor and descending in altitude. In addition, <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> noted, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> had just been in combat and was still fighting Iranian gunboats in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> at the time of the attack, <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> said. A written, summary version of <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON>'s investigation was released to the public three weeks ago. As with that report, his testimony Thursday painted a portrait of confusion and human error aboard one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s most advanced warships. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> is one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1 billion Aegis-class cruisers, packed with what the service praises as the world's most sophisticated electronic air defense system. The Aegis system worked well, <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> said, but the people failed. For example, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Air 655 had been continually climbing from the time it took off from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> and was at 13,000 feet when it was struck by the two missiles, eight miles from the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. Officers in the combat center correctly identified the A-300 Airbus as climbing until the plane came to within 15 miles of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, when they inexplicably concluded that the plane was descending toward the cruiser, <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> said. The misreading of the altitude was one of the most `` puzzling aspects,'' <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> said, but the investigators were never able to figure out how that occurred. `` The investigation was unsuccessful in satisfactorily reconciling'' the discrepancy between electronic data which showed the plane was still climbing and shouted verbal statements that it was descending, he said. The Vincennes incorrectly thought the approaching plane was an F-14, <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON> said, but the after-action report was never able to pin down exactly how that identification occurred. But <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' officers were looking for F-14s, he noted, in part because an F-14 had flown toward another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship, the USS Halsey, on July 2 as the <PERSON> Halsey </PERSON> was in the strait. Despite the mistakes, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators concluded that <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> had acted to protect his ship and recommended no punitive actions. `` There was no culpable or willful negligence,'' said <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> `` was protecting his ship'' and was aware of the example of the USS Stark.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached To Avoid Rush-Hour Strike in Chicago</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> and a union representing 2,600 brakemen today agreed to delay any strike until 9 a.m. Friday, after the rush-hour commute of 41,000 suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> riders. `` Both sides agree that this is a step that is in the best interest of commuters,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carle </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is expected to try to push legislation through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to settle the dispute before the evening rush hour Friday Members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> planned to walk out at 12:01 a.m. Friday when a 36-day cooling-off period ended, but compromised in exchange for a promise from the railroad to delay layoffs that were to occur on Friday. The railroad and the union are bickering over the size of train crews. C & amp; NW wants to dump 1,150 brakemen whose jobs it says are obsolete; the union believes the jobs are necessary to maintain safety. C & amp; NW spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said that in delaying the layoffs, the railroad `` preserves the commuter rush here in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and avoids the disruption that would come from a strike at midnight.'' Talks between the company and the union broke off late Wednesday and were scheduled to resume today, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, D-Ill. <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said Wednesday that the company and the union were `` still quite a ways apart. `` Because of the positions of the two parties, we're putting our strike plans in effect,'' <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said. The C & amp; NW recalled about 8,000 replacement workers and mobilized management personnel in anticipation of a strike against its 10-state <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> freight system, <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> went on strike against C & amp; NW for four hours Aug. 4 after an earlier cooling-off period imposed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ended that walkout by imposing a second cooling-off period. While the dispute involves C & amp; NW's freight operations, a strike would shut down the railroad's commuter service, forcing an estimated 41,000 people from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s suburbs to find some way else to get to work. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Metra </ORGANIZATION>, a suburban commuter rail service that purchases service from C & amp; NW, said a strike would cripple service and cause rush-hour chaos.

 Homicides deprive Americans of more than 600,000 years of life annually, the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported that in 1985, its latest year for such statistical analysis, the 18,351 homicides in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> resulted in 612,556 `` years of potential life lost'' by the victims. The Atlanta-based federal agency tabulates years of potential life lost before age 65 as a means of studying the most common causes of premature death. Sixty-five is a statistical benchmark; actual life expectancy is higher. On average, a homicide victim in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is 32, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Since 1968, the toll of homicides, in terms of potential life, has risen 44 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported. During that same time, the total of life-years lost to early deaths from all causes went down 25 percent. `` The dramatic increase in homicide-attributable -LRB- premature death -RRB- since 1968 highlights the need for public health efforts directed toward the prevention of interpersonal violence,'' said the weekly report of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> report, from its <ORGANIZATION> Injury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epidemiology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> division, called for increased cooperation among the criminal justice, social services, health care, mental health and public health sectors, to prompt `` development of effective programs for prevention of homicides.'' The major method of homicide continues to be firearms, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported. Firearms and explosives accounted for 61 percent of the potential life-years lost to homicide in 1985, or 376,291 years. Black males continue to have the highest homicide rate, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. In 1985, 6,284 black men died from homicide _ a rate of 49 out of every 100,000. White men died in 7,467 homicides, for a rate of 8 per 100,000. But the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> cited studies published earlier this year showing that the homicide rate for young black men is dropping. The homicide rate for black males 15-24 _ the highest-risk group for homicide _ has fallen 13 percent since 1978, from 1,934 homicides and a rate of 70 per 100,000 in 1978 to 1,710 homicides and a rate of 62 per 100,000 in 1984. Federal health officials have a goal of reducing the homicide rate among black males 15-24 to less than 60 per 100,000 by the next decade. The statistics `` suggest ... the 1990 objective for this target group can be attained,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Black female homicides numbered 1,550, or 11 per 100,000; 2,630 white females died in homicides, at a rate of 3 per 100,000.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plans a series of meetings with allied officials during his visit late this month to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, but the president has not attempted to turn the occasion into a Western summit, his spokesman said Thursday. Chief spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> confirmed earlier reports that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had invited the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to meet with him to discuss the stalled <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace-making process. He also said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had invited other world figures to meet individually with him during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s two-day stay Sept. 26-27. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> vigorously denied a report that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought to use the opening of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session to hold a summit with the heads of government or heads of state of Western allies. News accounts suggesting such a move, he said, `` are incorrect.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> dismissed such speculation as `` wildly inaccurate.'' Fielding several questions on this subject at the daily <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news briefing, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will `` hold a number of meetings with heads of delegations, some on a bilateral basis and some in larger groups.'' `` In addition the president will meet with foreign ministers or heads of state from several other countries during the visit,'' he said. `` We're not prepared to announce any specific meetings at this time. However, there are erroneous reports ... of a so-called meeting of industrialized nations, and that story is false.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that `` undoubtedly the president will meet either informally or at lunch and for dinners with representatives from several countries'' but said that none of these meetings `` can be construed as summits.'' `` What's happened is, the president's having a number of meetings and we have of course extended invitations to a number of heads of delegations for those meetings,'' he said. `` In some cases, a head of state intends to be the head of the delegation, and in many cases, it will be the foreign minister.'' `` I think what's happening is we have sent the invitations, those countries are reporting it, and then in the process it gets labeled slightly incorrectly,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Thursday, the office of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had asked <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to meet with him Sept. 27 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and that the invitation was still `` under study.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> already had been scheduled to meet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 29. These and other responses to the invitations sent by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> evidently spurred the reports of attempts to arrange a summit. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he knew of no plan by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to try to see each of the heads of state or government of the Western allies before he leaves office next January. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who singled <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> out for praise in a warm farewell speech at the conclusion of the seven-nation economic summit last June in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, is scheduled to visit here in November.

 A federal judge has lifted a 1971 busing order in the city's schools, ruling that segregationist practices have been eliminated. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, in a decision issued Tuesday, lifted the 17-year-old desegregation order that ushered in crosstown busing. The school system is now free to redraw boundary lines, reduce crosstown busing and set its own standards for an integrated school system, said <PERSON> Jannell </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said today there would be no immediate changes, but predicted at least 25 percent of the 9,000 students being bused for desegregation reasons could return to their neighborhood schools next fall Some busing will continue in places where it would otherwise be impossible to maintain an integrated school system, he said. School Superintendent <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang </PERSON> predicted today that the students being bused with be able to attend classes in their neighborhoods in two years. <PERSON> Willye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, the leader of the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization maintains the school system is not desegregated. `` We need to get the message out to the community that if this case is not appealed, we are going to be in a bind,'' she said. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> found that segregationist practices do not exist, despite some imbalances in the school system's racial makeup. The 104,000-student school system's ratio of white students to black students is 65 percent to 35 percent. The judge said the school system had done a reasonable job of attempting to maintain racial balance, although he said practical problems got in the way. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> wrote that <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s size, about two-thirds the size of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, made it difficult to rectify shifts in population patterns through busing. He judge ruled that the facilities and curriculum were equal at all county schools. <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> have the same borders.

However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> also said he would do what he could to accommodate those selected as jurors, including providing parking and lodgings in town for people from beyond the metropolitan area. Jury selection was expected to be completed Friday. Twenty jurors will be seated to hear the lawsuit, which arose over <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>' default on $ 2.25 billion in bonds sold to finance construction of two nuclear plants. The plants were scrapped after they were partially built, and the subsequent 1983 default was the biggest in the history of the municipal bond market, leaving 40,000 people holding worthless bonds. More than 24,000 people who bought the bonds sued, alleging fraud in the planning and construction. The trial had been expected to take eight months to two years, but settlements with many of the 100-plus defendants are expected to cut the duration to a year at most. The case was moved to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> because jurors in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> might have to pay for any jury award through their electricity rates and might therefore be ifluenced in their verdict. Named as defendants were <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, its member utilities, the 88 utilities that contracted with <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> to build the plants, bond underwriters and engineering and financial consulting firms.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite rising interest rates, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses plan to boost plant and equipment spending to record levels this year as capital investment remains one of the strongest sectors of the economy, the government reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said a survey found that businesses plan to spend $ 429.4 billion, after adjusting for inflation, topping the previous high of $ 391.6 billion set in 1985. This 11.6 percent increase over the 1987 spending total, if realized, would mark the biggest percentage jump since a 16.6 percent rise in 1984, when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry was still recovering from the steep 1981-82 recession. `` Capital spending is the main driving force in the economy at the present time and there are no signs that it is going to ease off,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. So far this year, business spending on plant and equipment and a boom in export sales have accounted for almost three-fourths of total economic growth. The two developments are closely related, as American manufacturers have rushed to expand production facilities in an effort to meet growing overseas demand for their goods. <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> estimated that one-third of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry is operating at full capacity, providing a strong incentive to boost investment. Overall, American industry is operating at 83.5 percent of capacity, the highest rate in eight years. The high operating rates have led to concerns that the economy is beginning to push against capacity constraints and tight labor markets, resulting in rising inflationary pressures. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has been pushing up interest rates since late March as a way of fighting inflation by dampening demand. Economists said the rate increases so far will not likely trigger any cutbacks in investment plans this year, although they expect a slowdown in 1989. `` It takes time to make capital investment decisions so higher interest rates wo n't slow this spending over the next several months,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. `` Companies are making major increases in capital spending to expand capacity and reduce costs through greater use of information-processing equipment,'' he said, noting that half of the equipment spending in 1987 went to purchase computers and related equipment. The new estimate of business investment plans released Thursday was based on company surveys completed over the past two months. It represented only a small change from a June report that estimated spending would rise 11.9 percent this year. Both surveys represented substantial gains from estimates made at the beginning of the year that investment would only climb by 7.3 percent this year. In 1987, investment spending edged up a modest 2.3 percent after having fallen 3.9 percent in 1986. Analysts said some of the rebound this year reflected pent-up demand after two sluggish spending years. `` This is a very typical pattern where there is a rush to spend on plant and equipment after a period of hesistation as companies waited to be sure of the business environment,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. The weakness in 1986 and 1987 was blamed on the soaring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, which sent the manufacturing sector into a slump as a flood of imports reduced domestic demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods at the same time <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies were being priced out of overseas markets. This year, manufacturers expect to boost spending by 12.5 percent, with all durable-goods industries except automobiles planning to boost investment over the 1987 level. The largest increase in production of non-durable goods, those expected to last less than three years, is forecast in the paper industry. Plants there are operating at 92.8 percent of capacity, the highest level of any industry. In non-manufacturing industries, the report predicted an increase of 12.4 percent in capital investment by transportation companies, including airlines. It saw only a 1.3 percent rise in investment spending by public utilities, which have faced problems of slumping electric power demand and delays in licensing nuclear plants throughout most of the decade. The mining industry, which includes oil and gas exploration, projected a 5.5 percent increase in spending in 1988, representing only a modest rebound after big declines in the past two years because of falling world energy prices. Before removing the effects of inflation, business investment is projected to rise by 10.6 percent this year to $ 430.9 billion, following an increase of 2.7 percent in 1987.

<HEAD>Brezhnev Son-in-Law Pleads Guilty to Abusing Office, but Not
Bribery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s son-in-law pleaded guilty Thursday to abusing his office when he was deputy interior minister but told a military court he did not take bribes, a crime punishable by death. On the fourth day of a trial so far devoted almost entirely to reading of 1,500 pages of corruption charges against <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> and eight co-defendants, Judge <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Marov </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> if he understood the charges. `` Yes, they were understood,'' <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> replied, standing before the court. `` I admit my guilt in abuse of office but do n't admit my guilt in receiving bribes. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> was accused of accepting cash, wines, cognac, exotic fruits and other gifts worth more than $ 1 million while he was first deputy interior minister under <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, the Soviet leader from 1964 until his death in 1982. Prosecutors contend the web of corruption stretched all the way to <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>'s boss, the late <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON>, who was a close friend of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. Court records confirmed earlier reports that <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON> committed suicide after investigators began examining his conduct as interior minister. Under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s years in power are now condemned officially as `` years of stagnation'' in which the economy slumped, mistakes were made in foreign policy, and corruption and cronynism prevailed. Almost daily criticism of him appears in the Soviet press. Streets and towns have been stripped of his name, a palace built for him has been turned over to the public, and libraries have been told not to carry literature produced during his rule. Judge <PERSON> Marov </PERSON>, an army major general, said <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> would be required to clarify his plea in the course of the trial. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON>, told a reporter punishment for abuse of office is 10 years in jail. If convicted of taking bribes, the 51-year-old former official could face a firing squad. <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> told a reporter he would not clarify the plea now but the explanation would come out during the trial. It is expected to last about two months, but Thursday was the last day foreign reporters were permitted to attend. <PERSON> Khaidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakhyaev </PERSON>, former interior minister of the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty Thursday to all charges against him. On Wednesday, he claimed officials pressured him in prison to confess. The other defendants, all former officials of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to taking bribes but not always to the extent prosecutors alleged. In summarizing the charges, the prosecution said: `` The demoralization reached unheard-of levels, especially in the party organs of the republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, the former <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, has not attended trial sessions. Her husband's lawyer said she was ill and would testify for her husband later. The lesser defendants, according to the indictment, accepted money and gifts from underlings in exchange for jobs, promotions and special perquisites of many descriptions, the indictment says.

 Discovery's astronauts donned orange pressure suits and threw switches in a successful practice countdown Thursday, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said they hope to launch the first space shuttle since the Challenger tragedy this month. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> plans to announce a launch date Wednesday, following a two-day flight readiness review here. Officials have been discussing a date from Sept. 26 to 29. `` We clearly demonstrated that we're ready to pick up the count for real; I hope that we will be able to do that by the end of the month,'' Kennedy Space Center Director <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> told the launch team after the test. `` It certainly sets the stage for what we're about ready to do here in just a few weeks,'' launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> added. `` You have a feeling this train is about to leave the station and we're about to get on board,'' said astronaut <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON>. `` The enthusiasm around here is obvious,'' <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said. `` It seems to me like we've finally got it put back together.'' He referred to the long recovery, with its many setbacks and milestones, from the Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts on Jan. 28, 1986. Thursday's practice countdown was the last of those major milestones, and it was completed with only a few minor communications glitches. It began Wednesday, and the five-man Discovery crew boarded the shuttle Thursday to participate in the final two hours, throwing switches, testing communications and monitoring systems, just as they will on launch day. The commander is <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>. The pilot is <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON>, and the mission specialists are <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lounge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>. All have flown on shuttle missions. For the test, they wore bright orange pressure suits, the first time a crew has not worn comfortable flight coveralls since the fifth shuttle mission in 1982. The pressure garments, which all shuttle crews will wear on launch and re-entry, would be needed in case of trouble during an emergency landing attempt and the astronauts had to bail out by blowing an explosive hatch, sliding down a telescoping pole to avoid hitting the wing, and parachuting to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. This emergency escape system has been added since the Challenger explosion. It would not help in a Challenger-type accident, in which the shuttle blew up 73 seconds after liftoff. The communications problems, in ground equipment, delayed some practice countdown activities and the test ended 34 minutes late. A computer stopped the count at six seconds before a mock liftoff, just as it would if there were an engine problem on an actual launch, giving the launch team experience in handling such a situation. The test concluded three days of training here for Discovery's crew Afterward they returned to their base at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON> will be back here next week to represent the crew at the flight readiness review which will determine a launch date. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said the meeting, on Tuesday and Wednesday, `` is an in-depth review that all elements of the program will have a requirement to sign on the dotted line to say that their part of the program is ready for us to fly.''

<HEAD>Energy Department Asks For Nuclear Waste Dump Approval</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to give speedy approval to legislation allowing the government to open in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> the nation's first permanent dump for radioactive garbage resulting from nuclear weapons production. But Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, said he will insist that the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, or WIPP, meet standards still being developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> before any nuclear trash is stored at the 10,000-acre site east of <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, acting assistant energy secretary for defense programs, countered that limited storage of nuclear wastes is necessary for an experimental five-year period to help scientists determine compliance with <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> regulations. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guimond </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s office of radiation programs, agreed, saying experimental storage would `` better information to make that determination.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said there is no way the WIPP facility can begin receiving the first of 210,000 tons of radioactive trash by next month's target date, because the steel containers for transporting the wastes have proved unsatisfactory in performance tests. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said tests of a redesigned container are nearing completion, and certification is expected before the end of the year. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> presided over a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee hearing on a compromise bill that would withdraw federal lands from other uses at the <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION> site, with permanent jurisdiction going to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for operation of the WIPP facility. WIPP is designed to provide permanent disposal of 6.3 million cubic feet of radioactive garbage from nuclear weapons factories _ such as plutonium-contaminated gloves, bottles, pipes and valves _ in rock salt beds 2,150 feet below ground. The trash would be transported to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> by truck from nuclear weapons plants around the country, the bulk of it from the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> and the Rocky Flats Plant outside <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report: Brezhnev Revived From Clinical Death, Left Senile Last
Years Of Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN GILMOUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was revived from clinical death in 1976, but was left so senile and weakened he had difficulty performing simple tasks the last six years of his rule, a Soviet historian says. The historian, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, wrote in an article entitled `` Advantages of Mediocrity'' that the late president and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary was weak-willed, untalented and the object of ridicule among many Soviets. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> `` ceased to understand what was going on around him'' and his public appearances, during which he had to be held by each arm, drew public ire. `` The Soviet leader's senility, infirmity and sickness became a subject not so much of compassion and pity on the part of Soviet citizens, but rather of irritation and mockery, expressed ever more openly,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> wrote. The article, in the latest edition of the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, was published while <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s son-in-law <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> and eight co-defendants were being tried in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on corruption and bribery charges. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, the husband of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Galina </PERSON>, was deputy interior minister under his father-in-law. He pleaded guilty Thursday to abuse of office, but denied taking bribes. Prosecutors alleged he accepted $ 1 million in bribes. The trial and appearance of <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>'s article are part of the increasingly harsh assessment of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s rule taking place under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s rule from 1964 until his death in 1982 are now condemned officially as `` years of stagnation'' in which the economy slumped, mistakes were made in foreign policy, and corruption and cronynism prevailed. A campaign has been launched to rid the country of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s legacy Almost daily criticism of him appears in the Soviet press. Streets and towns have been stripped of his name, a palace built for him has been turned over to the public, and libraries can not carry literature produced during his rule. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s health worsened in 1969 or 1970 until `` at one point in early 1976, he was clinically dead and after being revived, had to wait for three months for his thinking and speech to normalize.'' He did not say what <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> nearly died of. The leader's working day was cut to a few hours, and `` it became increasingly difficult for him to perform even the simplest protocol duties,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> described <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who died at age 75, as a vain man whose jacket was heavy with military decorations, even though `` he took no part in the decisive battles of the Patriotic War -LRB- World War II -RRB-.'' Throughout most of his life, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> advanced by being unoffensive to political cronies, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> suggested. `` He was n't a climber who elbowed his way to the top or betrayed his friends. He was calm, loyal to colleagues and higher-ups. He did n't so much move ahead himself as he was moved ahead by others,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. A notoriously poor speaker, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> made speeches almost weekly in which `` he often mispronounced words, long words being the hardest for him. His speechwriters were strictly instructed not to include long words in prepared texts,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> got his start in the Ukrainian city of <LOCATION> Dneprodzerzhinsk </LOCATION>. He became party chief in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> and later was sent by <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> to direct land reclamation. He returned to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> two years later and `` managed to transfer some of the people he had worked with in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' the historian wrote. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> moved into the power seat because his do-nothing approach was exactly what officials wanted after <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who was constantly pushing reform. `` After <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s removal, the top party-state apparatus did n't want an overly strong leader. They wanted a quieter life and quieter work. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s victory was thus based on weakness and the absence of obvious ambition and craving for power,'' the article said. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s legacy is of `` mismanagement, irresponsibility ... The corruption eroding society became more abashed and insolent, the abuses of power -LRB- and -RRB- the embezzling on large and small scales became the norm.'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> was expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Zhores </PERSON>, was declared insane. Soviet publications began printing some of <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>'s controversial works only this year under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness. He is the author of `` Let History Judge,'' a celebrated indictment of the Stalinist period that has yet to be published in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Along with <PERSON> Zhores </PERSON>, he also has written a piercing criticism of <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s maverick lieutenant governor, the nation's highest-ranking elected official of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> descent, faces a civic activist in a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary Saturday for the right to challenge Republican Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Lt. Gov S.B. Woo, a 51-year-old physics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION>, was a political unknown four years ago when he bucked the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership, defeated two legislators in a primary and won election to his mainly ceremonial post by 479 votes. Instead of seeking re-election, Woo now is hoping to go after <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, who is running for a fourth term. But first he must defeat <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>, a 49-year-old former staffer to the late Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> who later launched a non-profit company which helps obtain grants and designs plans to attract economic development. A poll conducted late last month for the <ORGANIZATION> Wilmington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> showed Woo supported by 45 percent of likely voters, Beard by 31 percent and 24 percent undecided. But Beard has heavy support from unions and unofficial backing from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders, and some observers think the outcome could depend on voter turnout. `` If it's a light vote, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> can win because most of the party people are going to vote for him,'' said state party <PERSON> Chairman </PERSON> <PERSON> Samu </PERSON> 70 percent of his million-dollar-plus campaign warchest from Chinese-Americans across the nation. `` People are very proud that a Chinese-American is running for a high office,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, Woo's spokesman. Going into the primary, Woo had $ 407,998 on hand, compared to Beard's $ 65,008. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, who has no primary opponent, had $ 734,933. Woo's ethnic background became an issue in the campaign when <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> `` Pete'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, president of the state <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, wrote an open letter backing Beard in which he said, `` It is up to you and I to save this country not only from the Asian influences the Lt. Gov. refers to, but all foreign influence.'' Earlier this week, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> wrote another letter apologizing to anyone offended by that statement. He said he was referring to Woo's claims that he has many contacts with business leaders in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.

 The millionaire husband of a woman kidnapped six weeks ago offered a $ 100,000 reward Thursday for information leading to her safe return. The offer came in a three-paragraph statement by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> released by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>, 72, was taken July 26 from her <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> home. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> has paid nearly $ 1 million to 12 people whose names were on a crude ransom note found the day of the kidnapping. `` My family and I have heard nothing from her since receiving a letter in her handwriting dated Aug. 10, 1988,'' the statement said. `` We continue to pray for her safety and safe return. `` I am offering a reward of $ 100,000 for information leading to her safe return to her family, or information leading to the identification and conviction of those responsible for her kidnapping.'' The statement added that anyone with information should contact the nearest office of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, said there was no immediate response to the reward but `` it's still early.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said he could not comment on specific leads but added, `` We are working all day every day.'' The ailing Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> suffers from ileitis, an intestinal condition that doctors say could result in her death without medication. The typewritten ransom note ordered <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> to pay an unspecified amount of money to people he allegedly wronged. On Aug. 23, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> announced that <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> had followed instructions in the note, and that payment was mailed to the 12 named in the letters _ or their survivors _ on Aug. 16, a day after <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> received a hand-written letter from his wife of 48 years. The 12 are current or former franchisers with <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The company, whose largest stockholder at one time was <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>, filed suit against the 12 in the early 1980s claiming they owed money from operating loans, materials and film processing fees. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> researched the monetary amounts involved in the lawsuits for each of the 12 in figuring how much to pay. Neither the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> nor <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> has given out the exact amounts he paid. Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s letter was the first indication she was alive. The letter, which the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said was in Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s handwriting, had an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> postmark. His wife's letter promised that she would be returned if the payments were made. At least one who received the payments refused to accept the money, while the others declined comment. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> is co-owner of <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and he and his partner, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> oil man <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, own controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Lamar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, awaiting trial on racketeering charges in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> bribery case, came to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> Thursday and asked reporters to help him repair his reputation. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawyer said he may have made `` honest mistakes'' in his dealings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and his longtime friend <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> came to power. But <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, 54, said he bore no resemblance to the venal influence-peddler depicted in news accounts. That <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, he said, `` never existed, does not exist, did not exist.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> portrayed himself as the victim of a vendetta by the media and investigators to drive <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> from office. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counselor, resigned last month after 3 -LCB- embattled years as attorney general. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> goes on trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Jan. 3 on federal racketeering and conspiracy charges. He allegedly tried to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other public officials on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, defense contractor that collapsed in a bribery scandal. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> reported in July that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> helped <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> in his efforts in 1981 and 1982 to secure a $ 32 million engine-building contract for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, and also aided his friend in 1985 in connection with a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was paid $ 150,000 by a partner in the pipeline project. The $ 150,000 was pooled with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s money and that of other investors by financial manager <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, who turned a $ 40,000 profit for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on a $ 50,000 investment in 18 months. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> steered <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to Chin, arranged two loans for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and helped line up a $ 40,000 job for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>. But <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> decided not to seek any indictment of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and said there was `` no direct evidence that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> accepted anything of value from Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> with the requisite state of mind for a gratuities violation.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who was paid from $ 1.3 million to $ 1.4 million by <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s officers `` have conned everybody'' and falsely accused him of soliciting money to quash the investigation. `` I'm telling you, I am an innocent man. I'm telling you the system caught an innocent man and the media played a role in it,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said. `` I am persuaded that much of what went on was an effort to drive <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> from office. ... I proved to be a most attractive vehicle to help accomplish that goal,'' he said. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said a `` great senior figure'' of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> community had commiserated with him, telling him, `` I should have explained to you where the paths were in the jungle.'' `` Is that what it's about? If a person comes here and makes an honest mistake _ and I think I made some mistakes _ does that mean you fall into the pit with stakes and it's all over with, you're finished and that's the end Is there no forgiveness for honest mistakes? Must it always be read in the light of malevolence and evil-doing and wrong-doing? Is the only access to success in your career to destroy someone?'' he asked the reporters. He depicted himself as a self-made man, a grandson of Jewish immigrants who won a scholarship and worked his way through college to become a pillar of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> bar and backer of liberal causes. `` I want you to know that I am not one of the great money-makers of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> legal profession. I frankly never really was that. I always made a very good living, but only practiced about half-time because I was doing a lot of other things, including a lot of pro bono activities and teaching,'' he said. `` My practice died because of the media coverage.'' But he said his friendship with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` has never been breached. The friendship is intact.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> lodged the same complaints Wednesday night at an American University forum on the press, where he was joined by former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political director <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, who is appealing a conviction on illegal lobbying charges.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered a Cabinet-level team Thursday to visit the forest fire zones in the West to see what more the federal government can do to help, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said nobody knows when or whether the fires can be put out. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said that no federal officials are expected to resign or be discharged because the blazes were allowed to spread. There has been criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for following, during the early stages of this summer's disastrous fires, its usual practice of allowing them to burn to encourage reforestation. Some critics, including lawmakers, have called for the resignation of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> directed Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> and Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> to go to the Western states this weekend to confer with governors, `` assess the situation'' and report to the president next week. He said one likely outcome is that more Army troops will be sent to supplement the 2,500 now on the firelines. The spokesman said <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> brought up the subject of the calls for <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>'s resignation, but there was no discussion of it. `` There are no plans to fire anybody,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` That call represents an understandable frustration by people who have been living with a great natural disaster, but that has n't really been a significant issue. We do n't expect any departures.'' As to the outlook for the future, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` The feeling from the two secretaries is that we can be effective up to a point, but no one is willing to speculate on whether or not the fire can be totally extinguished or in how long a period of time.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is the parent of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> includes the Park Service. Together, the two agencies control much of the 1.5 million acres of timberland on which fires are raging. Of the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of allowing the fires to burn, which has since been abandoned with regard to the current conflagrations, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` Everyone accepts that that was the right course, in the sense that good forest practice for the past several years has been to allow a certain amount of burning for purposes of resforestation.'' `` I think there is a general expectation that we can hold the line, but we have got to stay with it and probably will need some resources,'' he said. He said the fire season in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states is now beginning, `` so while we may be able to see some control occur in the <LOCATION> Montana-Wyoming-Yellowstone </LOCATION> area, it may be starting up in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and that is going to demand more resources.'' `` We could well be moving a lot more military resources into this,'' the spokesman said. `` I would expect that out of this trip will come some recommendations along this line.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called the meeting after Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., told the president during a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders on Wednesday that he `` wanted to express the anguish of his constituents and others in the region'' who have lost homes and jobs because of the fires The spokesman said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> received a status report at Thursday's meeting saying that 2,600 firefighters from 39 states were fighting 34 major blazes covering 1.5 million acres

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today dispatched a Cabinet-level team to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to see what additional federal help is needed in fighting forest fires, and the White House said the number of troops on the fire line is likely to be increased. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> and Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> IV. The three official are expected to leave for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> tomorrow. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said they would visit Yellowstone National Park and other areas suffering from fires that have now covered 1.5 million acres in six states. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said 2,500 military personnel are now fighting the fires and this number may very well be increased. `` I would expect that out of this trip will come some recommendation along this line,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called today's meeting after Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., expressed concern about the fire situation at a meeting of Republican congressional leaders with the president on Wednesday Although some critics of the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of allowing many fires that begin naturally to burn have called for the resignation of the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We have no plans to fire anybody.'' He said <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, whose department encompasses the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, brought the subject of these calls for resignation up briefly during the meeting but there was no discussion of it. `` Our feeling is that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have responded very effectively'' and were right to let the fires burn, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The policy was abandoned July 22, he said, because of the unparalleled intensity of the blazes. Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, R-Wyo., met Wednesday with <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> and suggested that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> director, ought to resign <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> have clashed in the past, but today <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> rejected Wallop's suggestion, saying in a statement: `` I do n't know anyone with greater love and concern for the national parks than <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>. He and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> professionals advising him assure me they are doing everything in their power. ... What they need at this time is our understanding of the difficulties they face and our support.'' In a news conference Wednesday, <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> and forest service officials admitted that in hindsight they should have fought every fire from the beginning. Of the 13 fires now burning in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, five started before July 22 and initially were allowed to burn. The other eight were fought from the beginning, the officials said.

<HEAD>Pathologist Says He Believes British Shot IRA On The Ground</HEAD>

 British commandoes who shot to death three <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas fired into the head of one Irish nationalist as he lay bleeding on the ground, a pathologist testified Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Glasgow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said at least four of the bullets fired into the head of <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24, were fired downward by a soldier as he stood over the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> member's body. A second pathologist, called as a witness by the attorney for the family, supported <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>'s view. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, who conducted autopsies on the men, testified on the third day of an inquest by <PERSON> Coroner </PERSON> <PERSON> Feliz </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzarello </PERSON> and an 11-man jury into the March 6 shooting deaths in this British colony of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24, <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged the trio were on `` active service'' when they were killed by British soldiers. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> regularly employs the phrase to refer to members on missions to attack British military targets. The inquest is being held to determine whether the shooting deaths were lawful, but it has no power of prosecution. Still, <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>'s attorney general is expected to return criminal indictments if the jury finds that the killings were unlawful. A senior British intelligence official who testified Wednesday said the British soldiers shot the three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members because they wrongly believed they were armed and on the verge of detonating a car bomb in the British fortress colony. The official, only identified as ` O' for security reasons, testified to the court behind a curtain. At the start of his testimony, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> spent 10 minutes detailing the wounds to the three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members. He said <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> was shot 18 times, five times in the back, five times in the head and eight times in various parts of the body. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> received five shots to the head and neck and three shots in the back, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said, while <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> received two bullets in the head and two more in the back. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>'s statements were based on the post-mortem examination he conducted the day after the shootings. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hucker </PERSON>, the attorney for the seven soldiers involved in the shootings and believed to be members of the elite <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> anti-terrorist regiment <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- SAS -RRB-, sought to show that the soldiers believed the three men may have still been dangerous despite having fallen to the ground. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said it would have been possible for the injured men to push a button, a reference to the car bomb British intelligence had thought the group was preparing to set off in the center of the colony at <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s southernmost tip. A second pathologist, <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounder </PERSON>, professor of forensic medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, told the inquest he also had concluded that <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> was shot in the head while lying face-up on the ground. `` It is clear from the scrapes around the margins of the wound -LRB- on the left side of <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s neck -RRB- that the bullet was coming from the feet of Mr. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>,'' Pounder said. The intelligence official ` O' told the inquest Wednesday that British commandoes had been informed prior to the shooting that the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members `` were dangerous terrorists who almost certainly would be armed and, if confronted by <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> personnel, would be likely to use their weapons.'' Critics of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government say the killings were part of an unofficial `` shoot-to-kill'' policy against <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members. British authorities said the three men were planning a car bomb attack at the site where the Royal Anglian Regiment band accompanies a weekly changing of the guard ceremony. The inquest, which is to hear about 70 witnesses, including the seven soldiers involved in the shootings, is expected to continue through the next four weeks.

<HEAD>More Arrests Reported As Police Sweeps Terrorist Hideouts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities arrested more suspected leftist terrorists in raids Thursday, the second straight day of raids of suspected hideouts of the Red Brigades gang in the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> area, a police source said. Raids on Wednesday netted at least 21 suspects and guns and grenades found in four different hideouts. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not say how many were arrested Thursday. `` We have won a battle, not the war, against Italian terrorism, which still can rely on many leaders at large and newcomers with no penal record and holding jobs in public offices,'' said a police officer, also speaking privately. He said the raids were continuing. Twelve of those arrested at dawn Wednesday were believed to be members of the <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the most active group of the Red Brigades which was implicated in several assassinations over the past two years, the officer said. The group claimed it assassinated Sen. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffilli </PERSON>, a close friend and adviser of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Premier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ciriaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION>, in northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in April.

 Moslem guerrillas shot down an Afghan military transport plane, killing two army generals and all 14 other people aboard, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s government radio said Thursday. It said insurgents brought the Antonov-32 transport down Wednesday with a U.S.-built Stinger missile. The plane carried 12 passengers and four crew members, according to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio report. Among the passengers were two brigadier generals, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Noori </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahad </PERSON> <PERSON> Razmenda </PERSON>, and Col. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Koshyar </PERSON>, political affairs director for military forces in the <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> region, the radio said. It described <PERSON> Razmenda </PERSON> as a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> lawyer. The plane was bound from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 160 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> near the Soviet border, the broadcast said. Major battles between guerrillas and Soviet and Afghan forces have been reported in the <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> area. Warplanes flying from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> territory bombed insurgent positions late last month. The Soviet-made An-32 is a twin-engined turboprop that can carry 39 passengers, 30 paratroopers or 24 stretchers, and is built for short runways. Soviet soldiers began withdrawing from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> May 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement and half the estimated 115,000 had left by Aug. 15. All are to be gone by Feb. 15, 1989. Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in December 1979. The insurgents were not a party to the agreement reached April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and have continued fighting. A separate <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio report said two of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s U.S.-built F-16 jet fighters intruded into Afghan air space over <LOCATION> Asmar </LOCATION> in eastern <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> province on a reconnaissance mission Wednesday. It also quoted the government as denying <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s report that an Afghan warplane was shot down Wednesday in Pakistani air space. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said Wednesday that four Afghan warplanes flew over its territory near <LOCATION> Nawagai </LOCATION>, 12 miles from the border and one was downed by Pakistani fighters. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Afghan refugees will be trained to dispose of mines left by Soviet and Afghan government forces, which are estimated to number from hundreds of thousands to millions. The proposed program by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office coordinating aid for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> also calls for public information campaigns to warn women and children returning to the country about mines. `` The first step is to train one or two returnees per village to have some idea of how to defuse a mine and dispose of it,'' said the official, an aide to the chief of the Geneva-based office, Prince <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>. He spoke on condition of anonymity. More than 5 million Afghans have fled the country since the war began and nearly all live in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s eastern and western neighbors The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement includes provisions for their return.

 A scaled-down version of a Senate-approved bill authorizing a monument to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women who served in the Vietnam War was approved Thursday by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, approved 96-1 in mid-June, specifies that a bronze statue of an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> nurse be erected on the 2.2-acre grounds of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial near the Lincoln Memorial. But the measure approved Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on libraries and memorials, written as a substitute for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version, says only that a monument to the 10,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> can be built somewhere on federal land in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> metropolitan area. This will force separate votes by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a specific site and design for the monument, as well as review by three federal agencies. Critics including Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., who cast the dissenting <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote, say a women's statue would violate the artistic integrity of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and create a `` sculpture garden'' for special-interest groups The names of more than 58,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel killed or missing in the Southeast Asian conflict, which are inscribed on the black granite wall of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> memorial, include those of eight female nurses. Some critics have suggested that a tribute to women who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> might be included in a monument to all women of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces, which is to be built at the entrance to <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>. The proposal to erect a women's statue at the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> memorial _ the most popular tourist attraction of all national monuments in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ has been endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> but opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The approval of all three federal agencies is required for the site, design and construction of any federal monument.

<TEXT>
 A multimillion-dollar kidnapping ransom could be bankrolling efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to disrupt the Olympics, <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> news reports said Friday. The reports quoted police sources as saying that the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> masterminded a 1986 kidnapping in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> that netted the terrorist group up to $ 3 million in ransom. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> warned foreign countries Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s possible windfall from the hefty ransom would increase dramatically the chances that the terrorist group is planning to disrupt the Games, which begin a week from Saturday in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members who are under arrest or being sought by international security authorities used Filipino operatives to cover their tracks, police sources were quoted in the reports as saying. <PERSON> Nobuyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakaoji </PERSON>, then 53 and head of the Philippine branch of the Japanese trading giant <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped in November 1986 by a gun-wielding band of Filipinos as he was returning home from a golf game. He was released four and a half months later after <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> reportedly paid a ransom of up to $ 3 million. Police, <PERSON> Wakaoji </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> officials have denied knowledge of any ransom. The case strained relations between <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and resulted in a drop in Japanese tourism to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and worries over Japanese investment in the Southeast Asian country. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members <PERSON> Osamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruoka </PERSON>, 37, arrested in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> last November for traveling on a forged passport, and <PERSON> Norio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasaki </PERSON>, 40, who is wanted for traveling on a bogus passport, were behind the kidnapping, the reports said. Night duty officers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said they could not confirm the reports. When <PERSON> Maruoka </PERSON> was arrested he had a one-way plane ticket to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, leading police to suspect he was planning to set up or make contact with a radical network to interfere with the Olympics.

 A memorial service will mark the 25th anniversary of a church bombing that killed four black girls and focused national attention on the struggle for civil rights in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s largest city. `` In embracing our history there is healing. Join us,'' reads an invitation from `` The Committee for Sept. 15,'' a group of black and white <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> residents planning the ceremony. Four girls, ages 11, 14, and 16, were killed in the 1963 dynamite blast at the 16th Street Baptist Church. The girls were changing into choir robes in the basement on a Sunday morning when the blast tore through the room. Twenty-three others were injured. The bombing, one of dozens of racially motivated bombings in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> in the late 1950s and early 1960s, remained unsolved until 1977, when <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambliss </PERSON>, a white retired auto mechanic, was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. <PERSON> Chambliss </PERSON> died in prison in 1985. Committee members said the remembrance will give blacks and whites a chance to remember not just the bombing but the civil rights struggle. `` We as a city are merely looking at ourselves, and saying that we remember,'' said committee member <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. The Sept. 15 event will feature a number of speakers, including the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, pastor of the church in 1963 and now an official with the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>. It will be held at <LOCATION> Kelly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ingram </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a site adjacent to the church where a civil rights museum is planned.

 <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, shaken by a wave of ethnic killings last month, has assured the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> that all its citizens share equally in the benefits of the bank's multimillion-dollar aid programs for the Central African country, a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday. `` We were terribly shocked and dismayed by the tragic events in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> V.K </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jaycox </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> vice president for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, told reporters.

The Hutus make up 85 percent of the 5 million population but hold relatively few government or military posts.

<TEXT>
 The House today amended a $ 2 billion anti-drug bill to permit death sentences against those convicted of murder during drug-related felonies. The vote was 299-111. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON>, R-Pa., author of the provision, said it would be a `` swift and certain'' deterrent to drug killers The death penalty debate was the first major controversy as the House considered some three dozen amendments to the anti-drug legislation. The provision went one step further than a 410-1 vote earlier for a mandatory life sentence for drug killers. The capital punishment provision would give federal judges an additional option when killings occur during drug crimes. The life sentence vote was proposed by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a death penalty opponent who offered his amendment as an alternative. Only Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., opposed the <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> amendment A similar amendment by <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON> was added to an anti-drug bill two years ago by a 296-112 vote, but the provision was later dropped after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> refused to go along. Prospects appear brighter for the death penalty this time, because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 65-29 last June to allow capital punishment for drug dealers and `` kingpins.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not yet begun consideration of its own drug bill. Other controversial House amendments would: deny student loans and other federal benefits to convicted drug users, admit illegally seized evidence in court if police acted in `` good faith'' during a search, and withhold federal highway money from states that refuse to revoke or suspend drivers' licenses of convicted drug users. As the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conducted a generally mild-mannered debate on the 375-page bill Wednesday, policemen-turned-lobbyists roamed through lawmakers' offices to present their views on a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchasers. They were not all on the same side in debating this provision of the drug bill, which includes an optional background check on the purchaser during the week-long delay. Rank-and-file officers supporting the waiting period are part of a coalition of law enforcement organizations and gun control groups. The coalition has set up shop in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> basement hearing room in the Rayburn Office Building across the street from the Capitol. Other policemen are lobbying for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes the waiting period and virtually any form of gun control that affects the general population. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., will try to eliminate the waiting period His amendment would substitute an identification system that would allow gun dealers to check by telephone or other means to determine whether a purchaser is a convicted felon. The <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON> proposal on the death penalty would permit _ but not require _ a judge to impose the death sentence on anyone convicted of intentionally killing someone during a drug felony. If the death penalty was not imposed, the amendment would require a sentence of 20 years to life. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation that passed last June would permit the death penalty for narcotics dealers convicted of murder in drug crimes; and for drug `` kingpins,'' defined under law as those who supervise five or more people, commit at least three federal drug felonies and derive substantial income from a continuing criminal enterprise. The only brief moment of emotion during the opening debate Wednesday came when Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, urged the House not to `` stoop as low as those killers in the street'' by approving the death penalty. He said it would be `` beneath the dignity of this House'' to approve the Gekas language. But <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON> rose to <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON>' defense, calling the death penalty `` the missing deterrence'' in the fight against illegal drugs. Most federal death penalty provisions are not enforceable because, unlike some state laws, they were never brought into compliance with <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> guidelines on capital punishment. The overall anti-drug bill provides for money and programs that would attack drug use from every conceivable direction. The legislation would increase spending for federal and state law enforcement agencies to intercept illegal drugs on land, in the air and on the seas. Banking laws would be changed to try to stop the laundering of drug money at legitimate financial institutions. Education programs would be expanded for youth, including disadvantaged youngsters and the most hardened gang members. Capacity would be increased, and waiting periods lessened, for entry into drug rehabilitation programs. The bill encourages Latin American countries to form a regional anti-narcotics force and pledges financial support if one is started. Federal contractors would be required to maintain a drug-free workplace. Tight controls would be placed on the U.S.-made chemicals that are used to manufacture heroin, cocaine and other drugs. States also would be given money to develop programs to stop the spread of AIDS by intravenous drug abusers.

 Anti-nuclear protesters shouted `` Good riddance!'' Thursday as the first American cruise missiles to leave <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> under U.S.-Soviet arms treaty were flown home for destruction. Two of the 18 cruise missiles deployed at nearby <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Air Base were loaded on a C-141 and their 55-foot mobile launchers aboard a C-5 Galaxy for the 12-hour flight to <ORGANIZATION> Davis-Monthan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. They are to be broken up at the base under the eye of Soviet inspectors. The missiles arrived unannounced less than a year ago, but their departure was public. They were encased in canisters atop camouflage-painted launchers that lumbered from <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION> under police escort, past the base insignia of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> flags crossed over the slogan `` Peace Through Partnership,'' then along seven miles of rural lanes to <LOCATION> Alconbury </LOCATION>. As the two mobile launchers and a launch training vehicle moved out of <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION> about 40 anti-nuclear protesters rushed forward and showered the convoy with their peace symbol, multicolored paper petals. They shouted `` Go home!'' and `` Good riddance! Do n't come back!'' Several <PERSON> Hare </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> followers in white and gold robes joined the protesters, softly beating drums and tambourines. Police grabbed one protester who tried to run toward the lead vehicle shouting, `` What about the warheads?'' Destruction of the warheads is not required under the superpower Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. They were not in the convoy and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials said they would be returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` in due course.'' The agreement to eliminate the approximately 2,700 Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> land-based nuclear missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 1991 was signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last December and ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in May. Some Soviet SS-20s aimed at <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were removed in February and nine <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 missiles were taken from a West German base Sept. 1. Cruise missiles first arrived in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in November 1983 and were deployed at the <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> Common base west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. It now has 96 missiles. Missiles deployed at <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION> were the last to arrive, in November 1987, and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> said they will be gone within three months. Younger declared at a news conference in a <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION> hangar that, despite <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of reform, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> remains on the military offensive. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said the world was now `` marginally safer'' and added: `` We are are witnessing the removal of the cruise missiles because we, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, have been strong and united.'' `` We are not here because some individuals, well-intentioned and innocent of the world's realities, kept vigils at our bases,'' he said, referring to protesters who have camped outside <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> said the treaty and missile removal was `` a stinging rebuke'' to those who had sought unilateral Western disarmament. Outside the gates of <PERSON> Molesworth </PERSON>, members of the anti-nuclear movement saw it differently. `` We're delighted that the missiles are going. We've kept up the pressure on this government ... and we claim part of the credit,'' said <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Beresford </PERSON>, secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. `` But we are very concerned about the possibility of new weapons being brought in which certainly break the spirit of the treaty.'' She expressed fear that Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government will accept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-111 bombers carrying air-launched cruise missiles, which are not banned by the treaty Younger did not deny <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> may deploy new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air - or sea-launched nuclear missiles, as well as maintaining its own nuclear arsenal He said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will keep nuclear weapons `` to deter, in such numbers and at such locations as are necessary.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reminded <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that some 10 million more women than men will be voting this fall, and criticized legislators for not acting on some 40 female appointees he's named. `` The hand that pulls the voting lever rules the nation,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quipped at a Rose Garden ceremony honoring a group of female administration executives. The Republican party is said to suffer from the so-called gender gap, in which the party has a lower level of support from women than the Democrats. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> argued against that idea, saying he believed that neither men, nor women, vote as a bloc. `` They look at the record and vote on the issues _ and those are the people who, on election day, will decide the outcome,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president took the opportunity to lambast <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, faulting the fact that some 40 females he's nominated to senior executive, advisory and judicial posts have not been approved. `` The liberal ledership in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> can talk about their interest in women taking senior positions in government, but they're not delivering,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> charged. `` They say they applaud the idea of putting more women on the bench. Well, if so, let them expeditiously move to confirm the five excellent judicial nominees they have before them,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. In his remarks, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> boasted that out of the 10 women who have served in Cabinet posts, four have served during his term. He also noted that he had been the first to appoint a woman, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` You do represent the leading edge, as I say, of the great progress for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women, and because of what all of you and so many other women have done, even greater opportunities for women lie ahead,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` The progress that we're witnessing is just the beginning and it can only move in one direction: it can only move forward,'' he added.

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Grew $2.6 Billion In July</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans took out $ 2.6 billion more in consumer credit than they paid off in July, a sharp slowdown from the pace of growth during the first half of the year, the government reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said consumer credit expanded at an annual rate of just 4.8 percent last month, down from an annual rate of 10.2 percent from January through June. The report said the slowdown reflected a drop in auto sales in July and lackluster sales of other consumer goods. Consumer credit had shot up $ 8.1 billion in June, even faster than originally believed. A month ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had estimated the June advance at a smaller $ 5.4 billion. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of his own <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> economic consulting firm, said that the July slowdown showed that consumers are remaining fairly cautious about the future in spite of the fact that wage gains picked up in July. `` Consumers do n't seem to be buying big-ticket items as they had in the past and that probably reflects the increases in interest rates,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has been tightening credit since late March in an effort to dampen demand as a way of cooling inflationary pressures. The smaller July increase was led by a $ 2 billion rise in the category which includes credit card debt. This followed a $ 3.7 billion June increase. Auto loans increased by $ 555 million in July, down sharply from a $ 2.8 billion June advance. The category which includes bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate declined by $ 62 million after a $ 1.4 billion June increase. The various changes left total consumer debt at $ 646.9 billion, up 9 percent from a year ago.

<HEAD>Activists Detained, Tutu Repeats Call For Election Boycott</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least 27 black activists, including leaders of two banned organizations, have been detained in an apparent crackdown on opposition to Oct. 26 elections, newspapers reported Thursday. Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, one of several clergymen to defy emergency regulations by urging an election boycott, repeated his call Thursday. Addressing about 2,000 people at the predominantly mixed-race <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said of next month's local elections: `` Please consider prayerfully what God wants you to do. We want to urge black people _ do not take part in a process which will perpetuate your oppression.'' The archbishop called on whites to join the boycott `` because the time of white politics is past.'' Police headquarters declined to comment on the reported detentions. It also has declined to give details of an investigation on whether <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> should be prosecuted for urging an election boycott. The anti-apartheid weekly New Nation said the detentions in the past two weeks are believed to be part of a government attempt to stifle opposition to the elections, which will mark the first time voters of all races go to the polls on the same day. Many blacks oppose taking part in segregated local elections as long as the black majority can not vote in national elections. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. Business Day, a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> newspaper, said the activists detained this week included <PERSON> Nkosi </PERSON> <PERSON> Molala </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Azanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Molala </PERSON>'s organization was one of 17 anti-apartheid groups banned in February from conducting any activities. It espouses the philosophy of black consciousness, or black self-reliance, developed by <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Biko </PERSON> before his death in detention in 1977. New Nation said 14 members of the South African <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, another of the banned groups, have been detained since last week. It said all top leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> now are in detention. New Nation, whose editor <PERSON> Zwelakhe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> has been detained without charge for nearly two years, said 12 other activists from the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> area were detained Wednesday. Two of them worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a social service group which has expressed fears about the life of another <PERSON> black </PERSON> staff member, <PERSON> Stanza </PERSON> <PERSON> Bopape </PERSON>. Police say <PERSON> Bopape </PERSON> escaped three days after being detained June 9. His family and associates have not heard from him since, and fear he may have been killed. Security police have seized two tape recordings of a sermon given by <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> on Sunday in which he advocated an election boycott. Such calls are punishable by up to 10 years in jail. In his speech Thursday, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> explained his defiance. `` It is not because <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> is trying to look smart,'' he said. `` I have a commitment and a passion for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. We have the potential of being one of the greatest countries. My passion makes me able, whatever the penalties, to do what I believe God is asking me to do.''

 A professor who said researchers have concluded the Shroud of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> is a fake was only guessing, says the head of an <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> team researching the relic believed to be Christ's burial cloth. The Oxford Mail on Thursday quoted Prof. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, director of the archaeology research laboratory at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, as saying results of the research were still secret. But Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the professor who last month quoted researchers as saying the shroud was a medieval forgery, said he stood by his word. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> condemned as `` mere guesswork'' a statement by <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON> that tests at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> showed the shroud was made in 1350, the newspaper said. `` The person who has been doing the dating told me that Dr. <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON> got the date completely wrong,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The shroud is kept in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> cathedral in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Cardinal <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballestrero </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> sent tiny samples to university research laboratories in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> for tests to try to determine its age. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> told the Oxford Mail that the results probably would not be announced until after the end of this month, after statisticians in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ballestrero </PERSON>'s scientific advisers and Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> were informed. <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON> wrote in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Aug. 26: `` I think that as far as seems possible the scientific argument is now settled and the shroud is a fake.'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said he was on vacation when <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON>'s statement was published. It provoked an outcry from Italian experts on the shroud who accused the British of leaking the results. `` I can not say what the true date is, but it is certainly not the one he gave. I am sure Dr. <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON> has not had any information. Whatever his evidence, he has no business to make uninformed comment,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was quoted as saying. On Wednesday <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON> said his information came from researchers. `` It's ridiculous of these people to pretend there were n't any leaks. I had an absolutely marvelous leak from one of the laboratories and it was n't <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <ORGANIZATION> Magdalene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>. `` It would be surprising if one laboratory contradicted another,'' he added. <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON>, a fellow of <ORGANIZATION> Magdalene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, librarian and a historian of the 17th century who has been interested in the shroud for many years, said: `` Nobody has ever bridged the gaps in the historical evidence for the shroud.'' `` I'm now fairly clear that the shroud is more than 100 years older than I once thought, but I always assumed it was medieval,'' he said. `` I think the tests should have been done entirely in secret and then announced. As for having no business to comment, I was n't asked last month for a news report but to comment on an assumption about the shroud's age,'' <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON> said References to such a shroud go back as early as the 5th or 6th centuries but then there are gaps, between reports of witnesses in the 12th and early 13th centuries and its turning up in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1354. In 1389, the shroud was denounced as a forgery by Bishop <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Arcis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Troyes </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, who said in a letter that his predecessor knew who painted it. The painter's name does not appear in any known document.

<TEXT>
 Two men were charged with poaching an alligator, less than a week into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s legal alligator hunt. One of the men, 20-year-old <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, had lost in the lottery to license 238 hunters, said <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loxahatchee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>. Each licensed hunter is permitted to take up to 15 gators in designated areas this month as part of the state's first hunt in a quarter-century. But no one is permitted to hunt alligators or disturb any animal or plant in the refuge. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tommie </PERSON>, 24, was allowed to post bond Wednesday, and <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> was likely to be released Friday, according to attorneys. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tommie </PERSON>, who said they work as roofers in <LOCATION> Loxahatchee </LOCATION>, were arrested Monday as they drove out of a refuge entrance. They were wet after their canoe tipped in the L-7 canal and they had a .22 - caliber rifle, a flashlight and a 28-inch section of alligator tail, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> After the arrest, `` <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> stated that he and <PERSON> Tommie </PERSON> knew there were lots of ` lizards in the canal' and decided to go out and get some,'' court documents said. Later, the officers found a dead, tailless alligator with multiple gunshot wounds, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. Although estimates place the alligator population in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> at 1 million, federal law considers the alligator to be `` threatened by similarity,'' <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. He said that the American alligator looks similar to the American crocodile, which is endangered. In order to protect the refuge's crocodiles, alligators are also protected.

<HEAD>Capital Homicides Already At Total For Previous Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With almost four months remaining in 1988, the nation's capital has matched the number of homicides _ 227 _ that occurred in all of last year. The shooting death of the latest victim, a 17-year-old boy, was drug related _ as were three out of every five of the homicides this year, police said. `` Homicides and shootings go hand in hand with drugs,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. In addition, the number of assaults involving guns have climbed to more than 940 so far this year, an increase of at least 54 percent, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` The numbers are astounding,'' he added. Until the demand for drugs decreases, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> predicted the city will see `` more homicides and more shootings.'' Police spokesman Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> estimated that if homicides continue at the current pace, 335 persons will be killed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this year _ far exceeding the all-time record of 287, set in 1969. So far, 95 homicides this year, including the latest, remain unsolved. During August, there were 41 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> homicides, a record for one month. The old standard of 37 was set in January. Police blame the upsurge on the growing popularity of crack, a highly-potent cocaine derivative. Many of the killings have come in turf battles as drug dealers have fought for selling rights for the drug in the city's 88 open-air drug markets, according to police. Of the 227 homicides so far this year, 156 have involved firearms, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. Last year, guns were used in 129 homicides.

 Doctors in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> hospital will search for a donor heart to be transplanted into a child at birth, an operation performed only once before, officials said Thursday. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> of <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, who is 33 weeks pregnant, was to fly to <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday night to await a suitable donor heart for her fetus. `` Baby Paul'' from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is the only other baby with the heart defect known as hypoplastic left ventricle to have had a transplant right after birth, doctors said. The baby, who was operated on at <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> 11 months ago, is growing normally, authorities said. Mrs. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>'s obstetrician found an abnormal fetal heart beat during a pre-natal examination and referred her to Dr. <PERSON> Greggory </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVore </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Intermountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fetal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diagnostic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> LDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> DeVore </PERSON> said the left chamber of the heart does not develop with the fetus' condition, and most babies who have it die within three to four weeks of birth. Doctors at <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION> will monitor the fetus while they look for a donor. If a donor is found, <PERSON> DeVore </PERSON> said doctors will perform surgery immediately following the birth. `` When the baby is born, the immune system of the infant is not yet keyed in to reject a donor organ, `` <PERSON> DeVore </PERSON> said. `` We know there is only a 50 percent chance they will even locate a donor, but we are optimistic,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Daymon </PERSON> `` The more people know about this, the better,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. The fetus was named <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> in advance by his parents. The <ORGANIZATION> Petersens </ORGANIZATION> have two other children, a 5-year-old girl and a 2-year-old boy. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> is a maintenance worker for the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> is a nurse. The <ORGANIZATION> Petersens </ORGANIZATION>' insurance company will not cover the $ 100,000-plus pricetag of the surgery. The couple said they do n't know how they are going to pay it <PERSON> DeVore </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> and the baby will be required to stay near the hospital for about a year following the operation. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said he would return to <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> after his wife is settled at <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION> and will try to visit her whenever finances permit.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said Thursday his delegation will stay in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> as long as needed, but the stalled U.N.-mediated peace talks with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> may adjourn soon and move to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of trying to `` derail the discussions'' by introducing such `` extraneous elements'' as freedom of navigation in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and conflicting claims to the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms the southern frontier. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told reporters <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` is eager to continue these talks at any level deemed appropriate by the secretary-general.'' Negotiations began Aug. 25, five days after a cease-fire halted the 8-year-old war, with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> as mediator. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed in principle `` with small reservations'' to a compromise formula proposed by <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>, the Swedish diplomat who has temporarily replaced <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> as mediator, but <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> rejected it. He gave no details. Asked in an interview with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official news agency whether he foresees early adjournment and a shift of venue to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the site of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> replied: `` Yes, I think. It will start in maybe two or three weeks from now, but the ending of this round of talks depends on the decision of the secretary-general.'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said his delegation is `` prepared to stay here as long as necessary'' and has no objection to resuming direct talks with the Iraqis, which have not been held since Aug. 26. He thanked the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> for `` tireless and sincere'' efforts toward peace. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a military analyst said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> caused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to accept a cease-fire by increasing its naval strength in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Levran </PERSON> said the war stalemated when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> sent more ships in July 1987 to protect shipping, and `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> realized that if it could n't win the war while confronting <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> alone, it certainly could not do so after a superpower like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> came to the gulf.'' Levran, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, was elaborating on the center's annual <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Military </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balance </LOCATION> report, published last month.

 Soviet scientists have lost contact with an unmanned spacecraft hurtling toward Mars, one of two probes designed to orbit the red planet and study its moon Phobos, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday. A Soviet message to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did n't say whether the problem endangered <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 1's mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amorose </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Deep </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> operations manager at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. `` They said they had lost communications with <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 1 ... but <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 2 is in fine shape,'' he said. `` They have not asked for our help. We have offered, and they said they do not need our help yet.'' Soviet media was silent on the matter Thursday. The problem is jeopardizing a joint U.S.-Soviet study of the sun planned for this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. Phobos 1 was to have worked with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Solar Maximum spacecraft, which has been orbiting Earth for almost a decade, to view the sun from different angles, providing the first stereoscopic images of the sun. <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 1 was launched July 7 and <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 2 on July 12. During the $ 480 million mission, the two probes were scheduled to go into orbit around <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> and just behind Phobos in January so they could study the Martian surface, atmosphere and magnetic field. Plans called for <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 1 to drop a lander onto the moon <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> on April 7, and for <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 2 to deploy its lander _ nicknamed the `` hopper'' because it literally would hop around the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>'s surface _ on May 25, <PERSON> Amorose </PERSON> said. Starting Oct. 10, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> was to help track both probes with its Deep Space Network, which consists of 230-foot, dish-shaped radio antennas in <LOCATION> Goldstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Amorose </PERSON> said. The purpose is to help the Soviets `` navigate the spacecraft to their aim points at Mars'' and also help receive data transmitted to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> by the two probes, he added. Solar <PERSON> Max </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 1 were to perform their solar studies later this month and again after <ORGANIZATION> Phobos </ORGANIZATION> 1 deploys its lander. The images from the spacecraft would allow scientist to study the narrow layer of hot gases on the sun's surface, said research scientist <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missiles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Sheelah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> was `` just churning inside'' when she walked over to her neighbors' house and blurted out that she had won the record $ 55 million <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lottery, says her friend <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Damron </PERSON>. And Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, 63, kept saying, `` Everything is just too big. It's just hard to believe.'' When Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> showed up at their door on Tuesday, `` She was so upset she could hardly talk,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Damron </PERSON>. `` I thought, ` Oh, my God, something's wrong.'' But she only wanted Mrs. <PERSON> Damron </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, to watch her neat mobile home and her cats and feed the wild birds that come to her yard daily, because she would be out of town for a few days. Was it an illness or a death in the family? the Damrons wondered. Then she told them, `` I'm sure I won the lottery.'' `` I do n't think Sheelah really believed it herself when she came over,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Damron </PERSON> said. `` She told us she had already gotten a lawyer and they'd called <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, so she knew she had the right numbers,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Damron </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> flew to the capital Wednesday and presented her ticket, becoming the richest lottery winner in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. Before she returned to this <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> community, phone calls began pouring into her home. They included calls from well-wishers, marriage proposals, requests for money and people claiming to be relatives, said two security guards who fielded the calls. One caller even wanted her to accompany him on a trip to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. In an interview Thursday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said, `` The only downside is my lack of sleep and what I feel is a great deal of stress for doing something that I'm not familiar with, and that is being in the limelight.'' A person answering the phone at her house Thursday afternoon said she was spending the day with friends. After realizing she had the winning numbers in Saturday night's drawing, Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> contacted two attorneys On their advice, she spent the Labor Day weekend at home. She said she became upset about speculation on television about who the Lotto winner was, and the story that a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> school janitor claimed to have the winning ticket. But the part-time real estate saleswoman told a press conference at the Lottery Department's headquarters that her main reason for coming forward Wednesday was not to dispel the rumors. `` I came forward to pick up $ 55 million,'' she said. `` No one waits for that kind of money.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, who is single and lives alone, did n't tell reporters what she plans to do with the money. And the <PERSON> Damrons </PERSON> said they could only guess. `` One thing she said she'd like to get is a car that would n't wake up her neighbors every time she starts it,'' <PERSON> Damron </PERSON> said, pointing toward Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s well-worn Mercury `` She told me she'd kind of like to stay here with her friends and maybe even keep her job,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Damron </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s only real hobby is her cats, they said. `` She just adores those cats,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Damron </PERSON> said.

Despite the ruling, <PERSON> Willye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, the leader of the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, said the civil rights organization stands by its claim that the school system is not desegregated. `` We need to get the message out to the community that if this case is not appealed, we are going to be in a bind,'' she said, adding that a decision has not been reached on whether to appeal. As a result of the ruling, the school system will be free to redraw boundary lines, reduce crosstown busing and set its own standards for an integrated school system, said <PERSON> Jannell </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Education Fund in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said Thursday that there would be no immediate changes, but he predicted that at least 25 percent of the students now being bused could be returned to neighborhood schools next fall. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said `` some busing for racial desegregation will continue in places where it is impossible to return to local schools and still keep an integrated school system.'' `` There's no question that every place where youngsters can return to neighborhood schools, a move will be made to do so,'' he said. The school system has 104,000 students, 35 percent of them black. About 30 percent of the teachers and 25 percent of the faculty are black, the court order said. Duval County buses 20,000 students each day. Officials have said that 45 percent of the busing is for integration. Many students riding buses from 25 minutes to an hour each way during the school year. In his ruling, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the school system had done a reasonable job of attempting to maintain racial balance at the schools, but he said practical problems got in the way. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> wrote that <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is so large, about two-thirds the size of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, that it is difficult to rectify racial imbalance brought about by shifts in population patterns by busing.

<HEAD>Mumps On Decline Again After Two-Year Increase</HEAD>

 Mumps, the once-common childhood disease, is declining again after two years on the rise, federal health officials reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported that mumps was down by two-thirds through the first 30 weeks of this year, with 3,166 cases reported in that time. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> also reported details of a mumps outbreak last year in three <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> financial markets, which illustrated the potential seriousness of the usually mild disease; the costs from the 116 cases averaged nearly $ 1,500 per patient. Mumps reached a record low in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1985, when 2,982 cases were reported _ down 98 percent from the 152,000 reported in 1968, the first year for the licensed mumps vaccine. Mumps reporting then rose over the next two years, to 7,790 cases in 1986 and 12,299 in preliminary reports from 1987. The cases reported in the first 30 weeks of 1988 mark a 67 percent drop from the same period in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The report made no speculation on this year's decrease. Recent outbreaks have occurred in high schools and on college campuses. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted that those outbreaks would include some people who may not have been vaccinated, because they were children between 1967, when the vaccine was first licensed, and 1977, when it was added to the list of vaccines recommended for all children over 1 year. One major outbreak last year occurred among an older group _ employees at three futures exchanges in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Between Aug. 18 and Dec. 25, 76 cases occurred at one exchange, 39 cases occurred at a second exchange and one more case occurred at a third exchange. The patients at the three exchanges _ which were not identified _ could not be positively linked, the Atlanta-based agency said. But researchers believe there may have been contacts between the three locations which could not be documented, said Dr. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> epidemiologist. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> was able to get vaccination information for 82 patients; more than one-third believed they had been immunized against mumps, but only three could prove it with records. `` The vaccine is how this could have been averted,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said. `` We suggest that adults have a complete immunization record -LRB- with all recommended shots -RRB-. ... But nobody thinks about adult immunization.'' The costs associated with the 116-patient outbreak _ including doctors' visits, hospitalization for nine patients, medications and missed work _ came to $ 120,738, or $ 1,473 a case, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. That, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, `` contrasted dramatically with the cost of mumps vaccine'' _ less than $ 5 a dose at public clinics, about $ 9 at a doctor's office. Mumps, which causes painful swelling in the neck, is usually mild but can cause serious problems in other parts of the body, particularly in adolescents and young adults. Serious complications can include deafness, orchitis in the testicles and meningitis or encephalitis in the nervous system.

 The fire that cut telephone service for 42,000 customers for as long as 26 days was not arson but the cause is still unknown, according to a report Thursday. A preliminary report on the fire that destroyed an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> switching station in <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> offers few conclusions, but said, `` No evidence has been found that the -LRB- blaze -RRB- was deliberate.'' The report was prepared by <ORGANIZATION> Forensic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and adopted as the official, preliminary summary by the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` Clearly there is international interest in what is going on with this investigation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>. `` Other telecommunications companies throughout the world want to prevent what happened in May in <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>. `` This appears to be one of the largest telecommunications disasters that has ever occurred,'' he said. Forensic Technologies is expected to release its final report in November, <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said. The company was hired by the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> is paying the bill _ $ 290,000 so far, he said. At first, the Mother's Day fire was expected to be only a minor inconvenience for residents in <LOCATION> Du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Page </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. But as <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> crews examined the damaged hardware, it was clear that what became known as the Great Phone Outage would last more than a few days. It was n't until June 4 that full telephone service was restored. The fire in the switching station started in the ceiling, in metal trays that hold cable above the telecommunication equipment, the report said. `` The fire department's use of water produced an immediate reduction of flame and heat,'' the report says. `` However, because the building power supply was designed to be very reliable, the source of electric power was continuous and the fire rekindled. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> is conducting its own investigation and expects to release its report in November, spokeswoman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said.

 With a deafening roar and towering clouds of white smoke, two nuclear-missile rocket motors were destroyed Thursday, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons eliminated under the arms reduction treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a 12-member Soviet inspection team were among hundreds of observers who watched the burnings at the <ORGANIZATION> Longhorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> in northeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, about 145 miles east of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Afterward, the Soviet team said it was satisified with the burnings. Last week, American observers went to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to witness the destruction of missiles there under terms of the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. `` This is the day we begin to reverse the arms race. This was the day we began to destroy the weapons of destruction,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said after the missles were destroyed. `` This was the day that two great nuclear powers began to move together toward a safer, more peaceful world.'' Under the treaty, signed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are required to destroy all nuclear missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles within three years. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he had asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to attend the event in his place, and he added, `` I think this step for peace is something we all can be very proud of.'' At <LOCATION> Longhorn </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> crews ignited the motor of a <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 missle and it burned its solid fuel rocket propellant for more than 50 seconds. Next, the motor of a less-powerful Pershing 1-A missile was burned in about 40 seconds. The motors were bolted onto a concrete and steel structure. After the firings, the Pershing 1-A casing was placed into a large hydraulic crusher and flattened as the Soviets and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, using binoculars, looked on. The larger Pershing 2 motor was to be destroyed later after it cooled down. `` We too are sending our INF missiles to the junk yard,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The missile stages we destroyed today are just the beginning. And over the next three years, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will destroy over 800 more. The Soviets will destroy over 1,800, capable of delivering roughly four times as many warheads as ours. `` And at the end, the levels will be equal _ zero on each side,'' he said. `` We will have destroyed an entire class of nuclear missiles and we will have relegated the INF missiles to the history books. We're witnessing today one of those unique moments in the career of man, a moment when the tides of history turn and a new future dawns.'' Col. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chabalin </PERSON>, a senior <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> inspector, said through an interpreter: `` We think it is a great event for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people, the reduction of two types of nuclear weapons. And today we have witnessed the fulfillment of a significant event in the elimination of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> missiles under the treaty.'' The Soviet team will remain in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Longhorn </LOCATION> officials plan eliminations of nine more rocket motors next week, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McClow </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materiel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Brig Gen. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, director of the On-site <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed to implement the treaty, said three other facilities will join Longhorn as INF elimination sites. Officials also will destroy <PERSON> Pershings </PERSON> and their launchers at Pueblo Depot Activity near <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, pending approval of a state permit application, and <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> launchers will be eliminated in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Ground-launched cruise missiles and their launchers will be destroyed at <ORGANIZATION> Davis-Monthan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. A small group of supporters of Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and other protesters lined the drive to the plant's front gate before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a civilian employee with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Redstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials had reviewed the Army facility's plans before allowing the burnings, which he said were environmentally safe The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began destroying some of its missiles July 22 and as of Sept. 6 had eliminated 92 rockets.

<HEAD>Report Says Air Pollutants Must Be Attacked in Combination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Air pollutants must be attacked in combination, not one by one, because that's the way they are helping to kill trees and stunt crops across the country, an environmental research group said Thursday. Policymakers risk worsening other pollution if they attack a single pollutant, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Ashry </PERSON>, the authors of a report for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. For example, current strategies to reduce urban ozone could be increasing ozone in rural areas, said <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> disagreed with that conclusion. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> study said crop losses could be as large as $ 5 billion a year from ozone, but they were unable to estimate monetary damages to forests. Dying trees in the East, primarily some pines in the Southeast and red spruce in the <LOCATION> Appalachian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, probably are being killed by the interaction of ozone and the sulfuric and nitric acids in acid rain, they said. Ozone in rural areas throughout the country appears to be roughly twice the normal background level, the study said. At high altitudes in the East it sometimes reaches concentrations the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has defined as unhealthy in cities. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said it was awaiting a response from its experts before commenting on the report. In the past, the institute has said it has seen no evidence that trees its member companies rely on are being harmed by air pollution. Like several other environmental groups, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> argued for a 10-million ton reduction in annual emissions of the raw material for sulfuric acid, sulfur dioxide, from power plant and industrial boilers, and a 5-million ton reduction in nitrogen dioxide emissions, the raw material for nitric acid, from boilers and motor vehicles. The two acids are the major components of acid rain. `` We should avoid taking action that corrects one problem at the expense of others,'' said <PERSON> El-Ashry </PERSON>. For example, he said utilities should not be forced to install expensive `` scrubbers'' to remove sulfur dioxide from smokestacks, as the current Clean Air Act requires for new plants. `` That actually works against the carbon dioxide problem and the greenhouse effect -LRB- warming of the earth -RRB-,'' he said. The requirement works to lock in coal to the boilers in question `` rather than allowing fuel switching,'' which would use fuels that emit less carbon dioxide in burning and thus cause less warming of the earth. Another example is <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s focus on reducing emissions of one urban precursor of ozone, reactive hydrocarbons like unburned gasoline, and ignoring the other precursor, nitrogen oxides, <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said. `` Those nitrogen oxides will generate ozone in the countryside and that still comes down as nitric acid,'' he said in arguing that both should be reduced together. The way the chemistry is believed to work, a reduction of urban nitrogen oxides or a simultaneous reduction of both nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons might increase ozone in some urban areas, said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, an atmospheric chemist at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Informed of her view, <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said such an effect is possible in some areas, and, `` You have to be careful'' to make reductions in such ways to avoid it. The report cited recent research showing that as little as 1 part per billion of nitrogen oxides in forests can form large amounts of ozone from the hydrocarbons emitted by trees, isoprene and the terpene family of compounds. Ms. <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said 35 percent of nitrogen oxides are believed to originate in small cities or rural areas. Without new control measures, nitrogen oxides are projected to increase in coming decades, and `` this means more ozone damage to the forests,'' <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Emisson </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards at Research Triangle Park, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said that with computer models, `` When we have looked at the Northeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a very crude scale, we do n't see big ozone contrations taking place if you do n't control nitrogen oxides ... Very tentative results do not lead us to say there's a big problem in the forests.''

 On the eve of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s fourth African visit, bishops from nine nations on Thursday urged the Marxist <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> government to talk peace with right-wing rebels. Archbishop <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Goncalves </PERSON>, president of the nine-nation Inter-Regional Meeting of Bishops of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said ongoing negotiations to end the 13-year conflict in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> set the stage for peaceful dialogue in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. `` Considering the situation in this region where people are trying to solve conflict through dialogue, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> should also take part in calling people together to talk about ending the war,'' <PERSON> Goncalves </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> should take the opportunity now.'' <PERSON> Goncalves </PERSON>, addressing a news conference in the capital of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> government refused to meet with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, also known by the Portuguese acronym <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>. Some 70 bishops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tome </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Principe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> are gathered in <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> for the meeting. The pope will close the 10-day meeting Saturday at the beginning of his first tour of five black-governed nations neighboring white-ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Goncalves </PERSON> denied the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> was in direct confrontation with the government in <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>. `` At first the government said they did not agree with the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Now they say they understand the position of the church,'' <PERSON> Goncalves </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> won independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975 after centuries of colonial rule and a decade of guerrilla war waged by Marxist rebels of <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The front is now the ruling party. <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION> at independence accused the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of siding with the Portuguese in that conflict, but relations between church and state have since warmed. <PERSON> Goncalves </PERSON> said the bishops discussed `` the problem of peace'' in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, in line with the theme of the Pope's visit. The papal tour will emphasize human rights in a region split by `` war and injustice,'' <PERSON> Goncalves </PERSON> said. `` The church must consider what we can do for peace, justice and welfare in this region,'' said <PERSON> Goncalves </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> diocese of <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION>. That port city is in northern <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION> rebels have been blamed for the slaying of thousands of civilians. The pontiff is scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Sept. 19. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of backing <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>, a charge denied by <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> has about 12,000 troops fighting alongside government forces in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and has repeatedly opposed dialogue with the rebels. Both the <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> governments argue the guerrillas have no specific ideological aims and are simply terrorists supported by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Army Flies Aid to Refugees; Flood Damage to Crops Estimated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An army airlift is carrying relief supplies to a refugee camp 500 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> where 40 people a day have been dying of starvation, a newspaper reported Thursday. <PERSON> Al-Ayam </PERSON> said the airlift had supplied the El-Meiram camp with canned goods and 1,000 sacks of sorghum so far. Relief official <PERSON> El-Tayeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Tahir </PERSON> told reporters a trainload of relief material arrived at El-Meiram last Monday and the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had been asked to allocate one train a week for the south. Thousands of southern Sudanese displaced by civil war, drought and recent floods have been moving north and many die of starvation or disease on the way. On Thursday, a month after the floods, the government said it estimates the damage to crops at about $ 365 million. Unofficial estimates put the cost much higher. The Rev. <PERSON> Aengus </PERSON> <PERSON> Finucane </PERSON>, director of the Irish aid agency CONCERN, said last month 40 people were dying every day at El-Meiram and starvation threatened about 2 million Sudanese in the south. According to <PERSON> Al-Ayam </PERSON>'s report, the army stepped in when international relief groups said they could not move goods to the south because of the heavy rains and floods. It did not mention the proximity of rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> forces besieging <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION>, 160 miles from the El-Meiram camp Rebel gunners shot down two civilian planes in 1986 and 1987 and the insurgent army, led by former Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, has threatened to fire on relief planes. The rebels claim the government uses civilian aircraft to move ammunition and troops. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>'s rebels began fighting the Moslem-dominated <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> government in 1983. They seek autonomy for the south, most of whose people are Christians or animists, and claim to control more than 90 percent of the countryside. <PERSON> Tahir </PERSON> said without elaboration that contacts were under way on arrangements for international agencies to fly aid to the south, but a Western official said privately the rebels were reluctant to approve such an airlift.

<HEAD>Agreement Set On Streamlining Mortgages</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The country's two largest purchasers of home mortgages announced Thursday that they have reached agreement on ways to streamline and simplify the often time-consuming process of obtaining a home mortgage. The agreement was reached between the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>. Both corporations buy mortgages from primary lenders and resell them as mortgage-backed securities, thus increasing the pool of money available to make home loans. The two companies along with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> have been participating for the past year in a task force seeking to standardize and simplify the mortgage application process. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Teutsch </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of local lenders, said the agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> was an important first step and should set the stage for more progress in the future. The mortgage group estimated that further progress could eventually cut in half the time it takes to get a mortgage approved. At present, this waiting period ranges from 45 to 60 days. `` During the past 50 years, the mortgage origination process had become unnecessarily complicated for both consumers and lenders alike. It was time to turn back the tide of paperwork,'' <PERSON> Teutsch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Teutsch </PERSON> said at a news conference that <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> had both agreed to revise their mortgage eligibility requirements and underwriting guidelines to make them more uniform. This is critical because local lenders follow these guidelines closely in making home loans since loans that do not conform are not eligible to be purchased by the agencies for resale to investors. About two-thirds of all residential mortgages end up being resold into the secondary market. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Croft </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president for operations, said that the task force had been useful in resolving several differences in underwriting guidelines between the two corporations. `` With <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> having the same basic policies, lenders will not have to separate loans during origination based on which agency they plan to sell the mortgages to. That will streamline operations for mortgage lenders, resulting in better rates for borrowers,'' <PERSON> Croft </PERSON> said. Under the guidelines, the two agencies reached agreement on 20 different underwriting differences including loan-to-value ratios, multiple mortgages to the same borrower, seller contributions, age of credit documents and how to classify investment properties.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Thursday of `` unjustifiable and abhorrent'' use of chemical weapons against its minority Kurdish population. In a 50-minute meeting with a senior <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> diplomat, <PERSON> Sadoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> threatened to reverse the recent improvement in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with the Middle Eastern country if human rights abuses continuesd. `` The secretary asked that the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government weight this factor fully in its decision-making,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, meantime, Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, introduced a bill to slap economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, in a statement issued after the meeting, said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` conveyed to Iraqi Minister of State <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> our view that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of chemical weapons in its military campaign against Iraqi Kurds is unjustifiable and abhorrent. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also used the word `` horrifying'' to describe the situation. With chants of pro-Kurdish demonstrators ringing in his ears, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> denied the charges in a brief news conference outside the department building. `` This is absolutely baseless and this has not taken place at all,'' he said. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> denounced the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a Kurdish group headed by <PERSON> Jalal </PERSON> <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON>, as terrorists who collaborated with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the eight-year <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. He said Kurdish refugees who have taken sanctuary in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> were free to return home. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s session with <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> initially was scheduled to survey efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> listened without comment to a report by <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> on sputtering negotiations being held under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> auspices. The official, who demanded anonymity, said there was no indication the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dispute was <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> over chemical weapons was having a spillover effect on the negotiations. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would explore with friendly governments ways to influence <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to cease chemical warfare practices `` which are unacceptable to the civilized world.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to say what those measures might be. The bill introduced by <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, would cut off economic credits to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, require the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to vote against loans to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in international financial institutions and prohibit importation of Iraqi oil. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, in a statement, said the sanctions would remaion in place `` as long as <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> uses poisonous gas in violation of the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Protocols and as long as <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s campaign of genocide against the Kurdish people continues.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> refused to say how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> obtained its incriminating evidence against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. However, he said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy official in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> had traveled through areas in which Kurdish refugees gained sanctuary. Earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it had no evidence to substantiate widespread reports that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> employed cyanide and other chemical weapons against entire Kurdish villages. Thousands of Kurds fled to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, which in the past has had strains with its own Kurdish population. But <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> had been very hospitable to the refugees, creating new villages to house them. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is convinced that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has used chemical weapons in its military campaign against Kurdish guerrillas,'' he said. `` We do n't know the extent to which chemical weapons have been used, but any use in this context is abhorrent and unjustifiable.'' The spokesman added: `` We have expressed our strong concern to the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government, which is well aware of our position that use of chemical weapons is totally unjustifiable and unacceptable. The secretary will be raising this issue with the Iraqi minister of state.'' In the past, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons against Iranian troops in the eight-year <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has consistently denied the charges. The session with <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was scheduled before reports circulated last weekend that Iraqi troops had slain hundreds of Kurdish survivors of gas attacks. On Tuesday, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> announced a `` general and comprehensive'' amnesty for Kurdish rebels in an apparent effort to counter the poison gas allegations. A spokesman for the Iraqi embassy here denied the reports, which he said were being spread by Kurdish leaders in <LOCATION> Euorpe </LOCATION>, far from the claimed disaster scene. He said the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army was taking up positions that had been occupied `` by people who collaborated with the enemy in the past.'' The spokesman, <PERSON> Abul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON>, said some of them may have been Kurds or Arabs. `` They collaborated with the Iranians and facilitated their movement into the country,'' he said. <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> also said Western newspapers had `` blown up'' reports circulated by a handful of Kurdish leaders who were touring <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, `` trying to air accusations'' against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The Kurds, a non-Arab people, are a stateless minority in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and other countries in the area. On Wednesday, referring to the Kurds' quest for autonomy, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> appeared to rule out <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for statehood. `` Our policy is that the Kurds should satisfy their aspirations peacefully within the framework of the existing states of the area and that it is a matter that has to be worked out between the Kurds and the respective governments,'' he said.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Measure Aims to Protect Elderly and Infirm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two House members on Thursday introduced a far-reaching civil rights proposal to protect elderly and infirm Americans from widespread abuse and neglect recently uncovered in the nation's guardianship system. Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., a chief sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardianship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Act </ORGANIZATION>, called the current system `` a national disgrace. `` Unfortunately, many state and local guardianship systems have become sleeping watchdogs of personal liberty,'' Pepper said in a statement. `` Even a convicted felon is guaranteed more rights in many areas than innocent elderly and disabled Americans who are subjects of guardianship proceedings.'' The bill, introduced on Pepper's 88th birthday, would safeguard the more than 500,000 Americans under guardianship and those facing the prospect. The elderly would have more rights and recourse under the bill, while guardians would have to meet new training and reporting requirements. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging, plans to introduce a similar guardianship safeguards bill early next week, a committee spokeswoman said People become wards of guardians if they are deemed incompetent to handle their own affairs. The guardian assumes their legal rights, possessions and decision-making authority; the ward typically is not permitted to vote, own property, marry or make medical decisions. Pepper said strong national safeguards against `` unnecessary and unduly restrictive guardianships'' are necessary because the system is so onerous. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON>, D-Wash., Pepper's chief co-sponsor, said the bill aims to `` restore guardianship to a system which does indeed serve to protect our nation's most vulnerable citizens. Specifically, the bill would require that anyone facing imposition of a guardianship receive adequate notice of impending proceedings, be represented by trained attorneys, be afforded an examination by an independent professional team, have the right to a jury trial, and have the right to prompt appeal of the decision or the choice of guardian. In addition the meaure would require that all guardians be of competent character, receive thorough training, provide at least annual reports on the financial and physical well-being of the incapacitated person, and be subject to annual review and automatic removal by the courts. The attorney general would enforce the legislation and could withhold federal money from states not in compliance with the act. The Pepper-Bonker bill was spurred in part by an Associated Press series that documented widespread abuses under the system, ranging from theft and fraud to neglect and simple incompetence. The AP series and its study of more than 2,000 cases were repeatedly cited in an explanatory document released by the health subcommittee chaired by Pepper. Among the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> findings: _ 97 percent of guardianship petitions are approved, indicating the deck is stacked against the `` accused. _ Nearly half the files on guardians were missing at least one annual accounting of money; only 16 percent of the files reviewed contained reports on the elderly ward's well-being _ 44 states require guardians to file regular accountings of a ward's money, but they were missing or incomplete in 48 percent of guardianship files examined The opening of guardianship was the last entry in 13 percent of the cases examined.

 Legislation imposing sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for its purported use of poison gas against Kurdish inhabitants was introduced on Thursday by Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, who told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` A crime of unthinkable proportions is emerging.'' `` For the second time in this century a brutal dictatorship is using deadly gas to exterminate a distinct ethnic minority,'' said <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` There can be no doubt but that the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> regime of <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> intends this campaign to be a final solution to the Kurdish problem,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said. `` While a people are gassed, the world is largely silent.'' The Iraqi embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has denied that poison gas was used against the Kurds, asserting that such charges have been spread by Kurdish leaders living in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The Pell resolution declares that the Iraqi actions against the Kurds `` appears to constitute an act of genocide, a crime abhorred by civilized people everywhere and banned under international law.'' The resolution would ban all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, ban sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military equipment and ban the provision of credit or credit guarantees. It would prohibit the transfer of sensitive technology to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and bar the import of Iraqi petroleum products into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It also would instruct the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to vote against all loans to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> noted that the Iraqi army moved against the Kurds after the Aug. 20 ceasefire in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with the objective of ending Kurdish control over a large section of northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` The offensive was accompanied by the dynamiting of Kurdish villages throughout the region,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said. `` Poisonous gas was used on the people.'' `` It is said we do not have much influence over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said. `` This may be true, but I believe we must use whatever means at our disposal to get their attention. `` The Iraqi regime is a vicious dictatorship toughened by years of conflict,'' he said. `` Hand wringing alone will not change their course; immediate action is essential.''

 South African, Angolan and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials met with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediator for a second day Thursday to negotiate a timetable for withdrawing Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. South African officials said <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials assured them they were not reinforcing their garrisons in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, speaking in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said his delegation quoted the <LOCATION> Cubans </LOCATION> as saying recent <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop arrivals in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> were replacements for troops about to be sent home. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he asked for greater clarification on this issue. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON>, South African director-general for foreign affairs, told reporters in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> the talks will continue until Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates 50,000 Cuban troops are in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, supporting the Marxist government against anti-Marxist guerrillas and South African military incursions. Guerrilla leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources have claimed <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was sending an additional 10,000 troops to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said this violate a month-old cease-fire between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and Angolan-Cuban forces. A timetable for <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal has been the main obstacle to an agreement, which would also facilitiate independence for the South African-ruled territory of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has linked Namibian independence to <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. A senior Angolan diplomat meanwhile was quoted as saying Thursday that <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION> _ plans to move its headquarters from <LOCATION> Jamba </LOCATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to northern Quimbele, near <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. A report from the Angolan news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Neto </PERSON>, an Angolan diplomat in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, as saying the move was to facilitate the continuation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> from what he claimed was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base at <LOCATION> Kamina </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deny allegations that <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> allows <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to supply <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels with arms by way of a disused air base in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. In a separate report Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> said the first of 11 planned frontier control posts, manned by Angolan and South African forces to monitor a cease-fire agreement, was officially opened Tuesday. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> does not recognize the cease-fire, as <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> is not party to the U.S.-sponsored talks. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> statements, released in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> Thursday, claimed the rebels killed 61 Angolan soldiers and shot down an MI-17 helicopter, killing all those on board, in six separate clashes. Rebel casualties were given as seven dead and 16 wounded.

<HEAD>Mixed Study Results Do Not Stop Need for Vaccine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A vaccine for dangerous childhood diseases that include a form of meningitis has had mixed results, according to three studies in a prominent medical journal. But an accompanying editorial in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says the results should not stop doctors from giving patients a new version of the vaccine. `` Like it or not, we must often make decisions in the absence of incontrovertible evidence,'' Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, wrote in the editorial. The original vaccine, for fighting a bacterium called Haemophilus influenzae type B, was first licensed for use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in April 1985, largely because a clinical trial in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> had found it was 90 percent effective in preventing disease in children 18 to 71 months old and older. An updated version of the vaccine, approved in December by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, is designed to improve protection for younger children. A committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> has recommended its use for all children at 18 months, officials said. The studies published in Friday's journal reviewed use of the original vaccine, which could be considered obsolete except for its cheaper cost, said Dr. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, leader of one of the studies. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said the first vaccine has n't been shown to cause harm, so could still be used. The bacterium infects about 20,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> children each year and in about 12,000 of those cases takes the form of bacterial meningitis, which can cause retardation, said Dr. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who led one of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> studies. Among other problems caused by the bacterium are infections of the blood or of the epiglottis, which can cause suffocation, he said. The bacterium is believed to be transmitted by person-to-person contact, officials said. About 5 percent of cases of disease caused by the bacterium are fatal, said <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>. He said he knew of no states which require the vaccine, but that it is administered to about 30 percent of the nation's children. When the original vaccine was approved for use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, information on its effectiveness was limited. Doubts were raised by some doctors who questioned its ability to provide protection. According to separate reports in the Chicago-based medical journal, a study in all or part of six states found a 45 percent effective rate of protection from immunization in 18 - to 59-month-olds and another, conducted in parts of three states, found it 88 percent effective in 2 - to A third study, of children beginning at age 2 in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, found that the vaccine may even increase risk of the disease by 55 percent. But authors of the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> study noted they dealt with just 88 cases, and that chance alone could explain the instances of bacterium-related disease. `` I have trouble puting a lot of weight on the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> study,'' said <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> said the newer vaccine has been shown to create more antibodies in younger children, so `` the probable benefits outweigh the costs and risks, if any, -LRB- and -RRB- I recommend use of this -LRB- new -RRB- vaccine for children beginning at 18 months of age, pending further information.''

<HEAD>Mrs. Aquino Says Lawlessness Is Government's Biggest Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Thursday that law and order has collapsed in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and restoring it is her government's first priority. In a speech for the 22nd anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a watchdog body that monitors police abuses, she declared: `` The demands I get are increasingly less for the good life, for social justice and other important aspirations as for the basic requirement that the state do to every man its basic duty: keep him and his family secure from physical harm, his property rights respected, and his community a safe and decent place to live and work in. `` The tragedy in this country is that this very function is so divided and confused that the state quite frequently fails to perform it.'' The president asked people to support a bill now in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would merge the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> and local police into one national police force. The constabulary is part of the military. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> did not cite crime statistics or examples, but killings and armed robberies are frequent and many crimes go unsolved. Firearms are everywhere and newspapers often report killings during petty arguments or drunken brawls. Last month, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> denounced the involvement of soldiers and police in such crimes such as murder, car thefts, prostitution, gambling and extortion of money from businesses and motorists. `` The first duty of the state is law and order,'' she said Thursday. `` This priority ranks higher than social amelioration, human development, cultural attainment and whatever else one can think of. This may sound unduly harsh, but only the ignorant will deny it.'' She said law and order are so basic that `` hardly anyone thinks of them until they are lost or gravely threatened. `` The only time the state remembers its minimal function _ the protection of life and property _ is when their violation reaches such proportions that the public puts on the pressure. The pressure is on us.''

 Half of the 1,000 people forced from their homes by waist-deep water headed home Thursday as floodwaters subsided, leaving roads passable and letting businesses and schools reopen. Scattered showers continued Thursday, but <LOCATION> Manatee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was spared the torrential downpours of the previous three days that turned streets into rivers. All but one school reopened Thursday. Damage in the rain-soaked Bradenton-Palmetto area of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> was estimated at more than $ 1 million. The area has been drenched by more than 14 inches of rain this week. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> planned to view the area by helicopter on Friday. `` The heavy rains and flooding have caused a severe dispruption in the lives of <LOCATION> Manatee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> residents and I want to see firsthand whether condiions might require additional assistance from the state,'' he said. The flooding was blamed on a near-stationary cold front hovering across the central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> peninsula. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the front Thursday was drifting north to the Tampa-St. <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> area, where the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> opened two shelters for possible evacuees from low-lying areas The steady rains were expected to fade to occasional showers and thunderstorms overnight. Floodwaters Wednesday swept away a motorist and drowned a toddler, authorities said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>, 45, was pulled under by a strong current in a drainage ditch and presumed drowned. He disappeared after a car stalled in the ditch and began to float. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richey </LOCATION>, 2-year-old <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehm </PERSON> wandered behind his home and drowned in a rain-swelled canal, authorities said. On Thursday, teams of inspectors went out at daybreak in high-riding vehicles and airboats to evaluate neighborhoods along the <LOCATION> Manatee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which overflwed Wednesday and forced the evacuations. Homeowners near the river were advised to stay away one more day. Floodwaters in some areas had not receded significantly by Thursday, and emergency crews said some riverside homes had several feet of water inside, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON> of the county's <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` The problem now will be shelter fever and people not feeling well because of high stress, worrying about their homes and belongings,'' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sapharas </PERSON>, shelter coordinator at <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where nearly 200 people were staying. At the church shelter Thursday morning, children passed the time watching television. Adults sat around tables in the parish hall, talking, after a breakfast of scrambled eggs, sausages and biscuits. The elderly and frail were given quieter quarters in the library and choir rooms of the church center. `` I'm worried about when I finally do get home, what condition my furniture will be in and what kind of mess I'll find,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a single parent with five children ages 8 to 17. `` We'll have to start all over again.'' Although disappointed, shelter residents were glad to be in dryer quarters. `` It's nice here, no complaints,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, 31, who spent all day Wednesday helping neighbors evacuate through knee-deep water. `` When they let us go home I hope I do n't find a snake or an alligator looking out at me,'' he said. Residents returning home were urged by county public health officers to disinfect sinks and showers, discard any food touched by flood waters and to check wells for broken pipes or flooding.

 Thousands of radical students Thursday protested the Olympics and demanded that the government release political prisoners and charge a former president with corruption, reports and witnesses said. In communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> called for increased economic and technological ties with capitalist countries. He also said in a speech on the eve of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary that he would welcome a delegation from archrival <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to discuss reunification The demonstrations in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and provincial cities attracted about 3,500 students from a dozen colleges, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. The most violent protests were reported in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, where 600 students, throwing rocks and firebombs, fought riot police after an anti-Olympic rally at <ORGANIZATION> Chonam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. Police fired tear gas as students tried to march off the school grounds, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. No arrests or injuries were reported. The students in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> accused the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> of trying to use the Olympic Games, to be held Sept. 17-Oct. 2, to suppress democratic movements, campus sources said In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, about 500 radical students and dissidents rallied peacefully at <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, urging the government to release all political prisoners before the Olympics. Dissident leaders contended at the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> rally that the value of the Olympics would diminish if dissidents remained in prison. The protesters, including about 50 people describing themselves as `` elderly democrats,'' dispersed voluntarily after a brief sit-down in front of the school's main gate. Police stayed away and did not intervene. Radical students, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have demanded that the Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> be shared with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to help reunite the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. They have little public support. In an interview Thursday, opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> said that he believed the Olympics would unite the South Korean people. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said Koreans wanted the Olympics to be a major success and that he was confident there would be no attempt to disrupt the Games. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it will stay away from the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics, because its demand to co-host the Games was not accepted. The International Olympic Committee rejected the North's co-hosting demand, saying the Olympics are awarded to a single city and can not be shared. `` We deplore a half Olympics,'' <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> quoted protesters as chanting. The students argued that the Olympics would only help perpetuate the division of the peninsula, divided at the end of World War II, the agency said. <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said students also demanded the arrest of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> for alleged involvement in corruption. At <ORGANIZATION> Kyunghee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Suwon </LOCATION> campus in <LOCATION> Suwon </LOCATION>, 45 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, 200 students burned an effigy of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and clashed with riot police, it said. Police fired tear gas to stop the students from hurling rocks and firebombs, the agency said. No arrests or injuries were reported in the one-hour clash. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who stepped down at the end of his seven-year term in February, has come under public fire for alleged involvement in financial and other scandals. Radical students and dissidents charge that the government is blocking legal proceedings to bring <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> to justice. In his speech, broadcast by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pyongyang </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> said developing ties with friendly capitalist countries is important in bringing his nation's economy more in line with those of advanced countries. `` We should develop good neighborly and friendly relations with capitalist countries which esteem our nation's right of independence,'' he said in the broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s sluggish economy is plagued with mismanagement, heavy international debt and an enormous portion of the country's gross national product, some 20 percent, spent on the military The broadcast quoted <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, 76, as saying during an 80-minute speech at a rally that a North-South summit should discuss creation of a unified confederate government reuniting the peninsula, which was divided at the end of the three-year Korean War in 1953. Reunification talks last month resulted in no agreement.

 Israeli troops fired Thursday on a mob of attacking Palestinians, killing one man. Palestinians staged a general strike in the occupied lands to mark nine months of rebellion against Israeli rule. Eleven Palestinians, including two 9-year-old girls, were shot and wounded in clashes with troops in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources as saying a 2-week-old boy, <PERSON> Nihad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaradat </PERSON>, died of tear gas inhalation after troops fired tear gas in and around homes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s Siir village near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. The military command said that there has been no army activity in <LOCATION> Siir </LOCATION> and that the fatality has not been reported to any Israeli authority. Officials at <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> hospital said they were not aware of the case. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, 14 Arabs pleaded innocent to charges they took part in a stone-throwing protest in April that resulted in the death of a Jewish girl who was shot accidentally by a Jewish guard. Also Thursday, the army said two soldiers and an officer will be tried in connection with the beating of a 17-year-old <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> boy, <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarazi </PERSON>, who died Feb. 9. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> Thursday that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s invitation to Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to attend a high-level <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> meeting came too late. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in an interview that encouraging peace efforts, `` has to be something the administration begins early in its tenure and works hard to achieve. That did n't happen with this administration and I think this is going to be a new administration that is going to do that.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for scheduling the meeting for for Sept. 26, five weeks before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Nov. 1 election. Leaders of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc accused <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, of engineering the invitation to boost <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s chances in the election. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio the invitation was not a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in Israeli elections, but appeared to `` belong to the -LRB- Nov. 8 -RRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> elections, and we were accidentally caught in it.'' He did not elaborate. On <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> denied he arranged the invitation and said both he and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> were told last month <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats were trying to work out such a meeting. Thursday's general strike was called by pro-PLO uprising leaders to mark the nine months of the `` intefadeh,'' or uprising, begun Dec. 8. Compliance was viewed as a key test of their control because of the growing rift between the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the Moslem fundamentalist `` <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>'' group, which called a rival strike for Friday. The general strike was observed throughout the occupied lands, but in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, graffiti scrawled on walls in red called on residents to comply with the <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> strike call for Friday. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops fatally shot 36-year-old <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> in the head and seriously wounded another man in the abdomen in clashes in <LOCATION> Silat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harathiya </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. The army confirmed the casualties and said soldiers fired when attacked by masked youths wielding clubs and knives. Palestinian witnesses said the violence erupted when youths trying to stop <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers from going to their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> turned on the soldiers and began pelting them with stones. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, a 13-year-old youth was shot in the arm and a 19-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was shot in the stomach, hospital officials said. The army confirmed the casualties and said one of the wounded hurled a firebomb at troops. Several violent clashes erupted in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and eight Palestinians, including four teen-agers and two 9-year-old girls, were wounded by troops, hospital officials said. The army said it was checking this report. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, riot police burst into <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and briefly held two children suspected of attacking troops with bottles and stones, the army said. The death of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> brought to 260 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising began. Five Israelis have also died, including 15-year-old <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, who was killed April 6 during a clash between Jewish settler teen-agers and <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>. The trial against 20 <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> residents opened in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> on Thursday, and 14 pleaded innocent to charges of participating in the clash. The other six will enter pleas later. If convicted, they could face sentences of up to 20 years in jail, lawyers said. Miss <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was killed when Jewish settlers she was hiking with clashed with Palestinians in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>. Many Israelis expressed outrage at the slaying, but the army later found Miss <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was shot accidentally by a Jewish guard during the clash.

<HEAD>Officials Seize 183 Pounds Of Heroin Found In Bean Sprout Machine</HEAD>
<HEAD>By ALAN COOPERMAN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the bean sprout washing machine was shipped from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, police were waiting. When they opened its hollow steel rollers, they found 183 pounds of nearly pure heroin worth up to $ 260 million on the street. On Thursday, after six men were arrested in the case, state and federal law enforcement officials said the heroin seizure was one of the largest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. `` This is a very rare event to see this much heroin concentrated in one location,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. He said the heroin was probably enough to supply all the addicts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> for more than a year. State police and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officers, acting on confidential information, were watching for the machine when it arrived by truck at a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> warehouse Aug. 30. According to court documents, they replaced most of the heroin with sand and waited for someone to claim the device. The heroin was hidden in the airtight, stainless steel rollers of the machine, said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. Four men were arrested Tuesday after they allegedly picked up the machine in a rental truck, distributed parts of it to two locations in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and then took the remainder to a scrap metal dealer. Undercover <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents later delivered some of the heroin to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where they arrested two more men Wednesday night. All six suspects have been charged with possession of heroin and conspiracy to distribute the drug, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said authorities believe the men are important figures in the drug trade, not merely `` mules,'' or carriers of drugs, and may have ties to Chinese organized crime groups. Police in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> have conducted several raids in recent days in connection with the case, but no arrests have been made there, he said. Five cardboard cartons of heroin were displayed at the news conference, along with the disassembled parts of the bean sprout machine, a contraption of prongs and rollers used by Oriental restaurants and produce merchants. `` The concealment effort was outstanding,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, acting special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> region. Regional Customs Director <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spayd </PERSON> said the amount of heroin seized was one of the largest in the country and the largest ever in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Approximately 200 pounds was discovered in a shipment of ice buckets in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in 1985, and 378 pounds was found in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in 1971. Once diluted, the street value of the seized heroin would have been between $ 200 million and $ 260 million, he said. Police said the four men arrested in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> were of Vietnamese origin and gave their names as Hung Ta, 24; <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> <PERSON> Phu </PERSON>, 23; <PERSON> Hieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ly </PERSON>, 24; and <PERSON> Tuong </PERSON> <PERSON> Luu </PERSON>, 45. They were in the custody pending arraignment Friday. The two men arrested in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were identified as <PERSON> Wai </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwok </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, 40, and <PERSON> Sik-Sze </PERSON> <PERSON> Yan </PERSON>, 36. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said they are of Chinese origin. They appeared Thursday before a federal magistrate in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> but did not enter pleas and were held without bail pending a detention hearing Sept. 14.

<HEAD>Post Office, Union Pursue Talks In Mail Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> met Thursday in an attempt to end <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s week-old mail strike. International mail service remained at a standstill. But about half of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 1,500 local post offices opened with non-striking and temporary staff who made sporadic deliveries, said <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Francke </PERSON>. The walkout began Aug. 31 as a 24-hour strike called in a dispute over bonuses paid to new recruits in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where the cost of living is high and the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has trouble attracting workers because of low unemployment. The strike now has no time limit, with the union demanding that the bonuses be paid nationally or not at all. `` Until there is a concrete framework agreed on over the central recruitment issue and a formula over getting postmen back to work quickly these exploratory talks will go on,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Francke </PERSON>. Union President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuffin </PERSON> said Thursday, `` We are no nearer reaching an agreement.'' A spokesman would not confirm whether <PERSON> Tuffin </PERSON> joined the talks. About 100,000 of the union's 140,000 members stayed off the job Thursday, said Ms. <PERSON> Francke </PERSON>, and only one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 82 main postal sorting centers, in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, opened for business. More than 100 million pieces of mail have piled up since the strike began, said Ms. <PERSON> Francke </PERSON>. Mail boxes around the country have been sealed. <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> police said strikers in that city, 200 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, behaved peacefully Thursday but picket line violence during the week led to the arrest of five strikers for disorderly conduct. The strike has disrupted business and the work of government agencies. A watchdog body, the <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Users </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the dispute is costing British industry $ 43 million a day.

<TEXT>
 A 63-year-old Jewish `` refusenik'' dying of cancer has again been denied permission to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for urgently needed medical treatment, a Soviet Jewry group said Thursday. The Union of Councils for Soviet Jews said it had learned that Soviet authorities have refused to grant an exit visa for <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Samoilovich </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> mathematician suffering from a deadly throat lymphoma. Last month, <PERSON> Samoilovich </PERSON> was removed from a waiting list to enter the <ORGANIZATION> Blokhin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for treatment. <PERSON> Samoilovich </PERSON> has been seeking permission to emigrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for 11 years. His wife, a physician, also is a refusenik. Americans who have been urging the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government to let <PERSON> Samoilovich </PERSON> emigrate include Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbluth </PERSON>, chief oncologist at <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` We will be starting a last, desperate, all-out campaign to save his life, and I hope the world will be with us,'' <PERSON> Rosenbluth </PERSON> said.

But <PERSON> Rosenbluth </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Samoilovich </PERSON> `` has not worked in his profession in over 10 years.'' `` The injustice of this case is overwhelming, especially in light of the new humanitarian facade the Soviets are putting on,'' <PERSON> Rosenbluth </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Deposits Flow Out For Third Consecutive Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Deposits flowed out of the nation's savings institutions for the third consecutive month in July, the government said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said net withdrawals from the 3,088 savings institutions were $ 123 million in July after hitting a revised $ 3.3 billion in June, up from a previous estimate of $ 2.9 billion. In May, S & amp; L customers withdrew $ 1.1 billion. But, before that deposits grew for seven consecutive months as investors battered by the October stock market crash sought a safe haven for their money in government-insured accounts. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said in a statement that a slowdown in withdrawals is normal for July. Consumers typically take money from their accounts at the start of summer to pay for vacations and other seasonal expenses. Mortgage lending by thrift institutions in July declined to $ 21.1 billion, 14 percent below the same month last year when many people were refinancing their mortgages, the bank board said. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said the drop in mortgage lending reflects the climb in interest rates this summer. The bank board also reported that the institutions' capital declined by $ 573 million in July after falling by $ 3.0 billion in June. For the first seven months of the year, it's off $ 6.4 billion. Declines in capital, which is the difference between an institution's loans and other assets and what it owes to depositors and other creditors, often reflect losses.

<HEAD>Growth In Spending By PACS Slows As Races Are Less Competitive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Spending by political action committees to influence the 1988 elections is on the increase, but the rise is far smaller than in previous years, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Several political scientists said the money figures compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> indicate that the PAC movement may be leveling off and reaching its saturation point. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> said that for the 18 months ending June 30, PACs representing business, labor, ideological and other interest groups spent $ 215.4 million, a 4.8 percent increase over the same period in the 1985-6 election cycle. The increase, however, was well below the 38 percent rise in <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> spending that occurred in the corresponding 18 months of the 1985-6 cycle when compared to the 1983-4 cycle, which itself was up 44 percent over 1981-2. Receipts by PACs showed a similar slowing in growth. The $ 266.6 million collected during the first 18 months of the current cycle was 4.7 percent above 1985-6, which saw 18-month receipts running 30 percent above 1983-4, which was 42 percent over 1981-2. As of June 30, PACs had given $ 94.9 million to candidates for federal office: $ 3 million to presidential races, $ 32.7 million to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates and $ 59.2 million to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> candidates. This represented a 21 percent increase over the same 18 months in 1985-6. This rate, however, was below the 38 percent rise from 1983-4 to 1985-6 and the 49 percent growth from 1981-2 to 1983-4. Incumbent senators and representatives got got nearly 90 percent of the money contributed by PACs to congressional races in the first 18 months of this election cycle. Democrats led Republicans $ 60.9 million to $ 33.9 million. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, a congressional analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank, said the double-digit percentage increases in PAC receipts and spending could n't continue indefinitely. `` We may have reached a saturation point,'' he said. `` That's good news for all of us except campaign vendors. <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said that `` it's hard to say whether we've got a long-term trend.'' He said the reduced rates of increase could be partly attributable to `` to so few competitive races in the House. There is n't the demand from incumbents to put the screws to PACs.'' <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Grenzke </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said the figures could indicate `` the saturation point is nearing'' for PACs. `` Those people who were going to form PACs and who were going to participate in the political process through them have pretty much done so,'' <PERSON> Grenzke </PERSON> said. She said some political money that previously might have been channeled through PACs now could be ending up as `` soft money,'' the less-controlled and little-reported cash flow increasingly finding its way to places like political party committees. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, a political science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, said the number of PACs has leveled off, as has the number of PACs that are really active. `` A couple of hundred PACs do half the business,'' he said. `` There's an ingrown limitation on how much they can raise. ... While it's not at a standstill, the growth rate is n't as explosive. ... `` The PAC phenomenom is reaching a point of natural limits,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Huwa </PERSON> of Common Cause, the self-described citizens lobby that has been urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to outlaw PACs, said he was not heartened by the latest <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> figures. `` The first thing I look at is contributions to candidates, and that's continuing to grow,'' he said.

<HEAD>FTC Aid Dismissed After Dukakis Letter</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDS two grafs with comment by Clews.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> aide has been dismissed after sending a letter to newspaper editorial boards criticizing Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Clews </PERSON>, associate director for media relations, was dismissed on Wednesday, said <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> general counsel <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who said his office has been assigned to investigate the case. The letter was sent Aug. 4 by <PERSON> Clews </PERSON> to newspapers, offering to rebut criticism of the agency by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and questioning statements made by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a controversy over advertising by optometrists. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said he was not prepared to say whether <PERSON> Clews </PERSON>' action violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits political acitvity by federal workers. He said the investigation is continuing. Meanwhile <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> commissioners <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuenaga </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strenio </PERSON> issued a statement dissociating themselves from a second latter sent by <PERSON> Clews </PERSON> to broadcast talk show hosts offering appearances by commission members. That letter contains a postscript saying that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been critical of the commission and adds that commission members are willing to discuss the records of the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> and of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. <PERSON> Azcuenaga </PERSON>, an independent, and <PERSON> Strenio </PERSON>, a Democrat, said they are happy to make appearances to discuss consumer affairs and other commission activities but will not discuss candidates for public office. <PERSON> Clews </PERSON> said later Friday, `` I do n't believe I violated the Hatch Act, and the general counsel himself has not said I violated the Hatch Act. And if I had violated the Hatch Act, there are certain procedures that by law they have to go through to give me a fair hearing. None of that was done.'' `` I think this whole thing is political and I was targeted because Commissioner <PERSON> Strenio </PERSON> and Commissioner <PERSON> Azcuenaga </PERSON> want to prevent Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from being criticized for his own attacks upon the commission. All I did was try to set straight the record of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said.

 Five policemen and a girl were slightly hurt when a bomb planted in a van parked outside a village police station exploded Thursday, police said. The explosion, which caused extensive damage to the police station building and nearby houses, happened at the <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Coagh </LOCATION> 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. A press officer at <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police headquarters, who in accordance with British practice declined to be identified, said a warning was telephoned to police at Coagh shortly before the blast. Police were evacuating people from nearby houses when the bomb went off. Police said the girl was believed to have been in a telephone booth near the police station at the time of the explosion. They did not have her age but said she was in her early teens. One of the five injured policemen and the girl were taken to a hospital at nearby <LOCATION> Magherafelt </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The presidential campaigns of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have tentatively agreed on Sept. 25 for the first debate between the two candidates, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide said Thursday. Both debates will be general in subject matter, in contrast to four years ago when the first was on domestic policy and the second covered defense and foreign policy, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, chairman of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, said the two contenders will face each other in a televised debate at <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> N.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brountas </ORGANIZATION> said their second debate would be either Oct. 13 or 14, depending on the length of the American League baseball playoff series which will be televised in prime time. The debate between vice presidential candidates <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is expected to take place during the week of Oct. 3. The two campaigns have not reached agreement on the location for the second presidential debate and the vice presidential encounter, he said. `` We are still discussing format, staging and the length of the debates and we will continue to carry on those discussions,'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said after meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` We believe we made good progress. This will be an opportunity for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to see presidential candidates debating face-to-face and man-to-man.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign wanted at least one more debate, with the first to be on foreign policy and national security issues, but that was rejected by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> emphasized that nothing is finally settled until they have agreed on all aspects of the debates. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday night: `` It sounds very good. Got the right number.'' Additionally, a statement released on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Two </ORGANIZATION> said, `` I congratulate our negotiators on working out a formula for the number and timing of debates which certainly has my support.'' On Tuesday, after weeks of negotiations, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign said it was willing to accept the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's offer of two presidential debates as well as one encounter between <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. The first debate will be sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Debates </ORGANIZATION>, a group headed by the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic parties. The commission also was likely to end up as sponsor of the vice presidential debate. The League of Women Voters will sponsor the second presidential debate. League president <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said, `` The league is pleased that it's now official that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public will see at least one non-partisan debate this fall.'' She urged the campaigns to include the league in discussions on format. Last spring, the league suggested 90-minute debates with a single moderator rather than a panel of reporters such as used in past presidential debates. <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said the site of the second presidential debate would likely be on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> issued a statement saying the network would not be able to televise the first debate live because it would conflict with its commitment to cover the Olympic Games. `` NBC News will run a taped replay of the first presidential debate between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that now has been scheduled for Sunday, Sept. 25,'' <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has long been committed to broadcasting the Olympics, whose dates were known by both political parties.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, drawing on the advantages of office to promote his presidential campaign, watched the fiery destruction of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear-missile rocket motors Thursday and charged later that Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wants `` to restrain us, not the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'' in arms control. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican nominee for president, was the senior government representative and featured speaker at <ORGANIZATION> Longhorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> in northeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for a ceremony marking the destruction of the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons under the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. The event provided a highly telegenic campaign showcase and dovetailed into <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s themes of peace and prosperity. In a state where 29 electoral votes are up for grabs in a close race, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also campaigned in <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> and criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for supporting a nuclear freeze as the INF missiles were being deployed in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in response to a Soviet builduip. `` He wanted to restrain us, not the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an enthusiastic <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> crowd. `` Therein lies a big difference between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' In a setting designed for television cameras, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was joined on stage by the Apache Belles, an all-female drill team from <ORGANIZATION> Tyler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, dressed in cowgirl hats and swimming suit-style outfits decorated with fringe. `` I want to see us build on this record of peace through strength and it ca n't be done if we have a naive view of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> anew for opposing the MX and <LOCATION> Midgetmen </LOCATION> missiles, the Strategic Defense Initiative, the B-1 bomber and two aircraft carrier task forces. `` He asks for nothing in return,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We must not _ and if I am elected I will not _ make unilateral concessions to Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> or the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, press secretary to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said the cost of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s travel to the rocket-destruction in <LOCATION> Karnack </LOCATION> and related expenses were being paid out of campaign funds, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said it was not a campaign event In another development, she said the vice president _ in a reversal of policy _ supports an increase in the minimum wage, which has been fixed for seven years at $ 3.35 an hour. She did not say how large a hike he favors. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an interview in <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, acknowledged that he goes out of his way not to mention <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, fellow Texan <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` I keep crossing it out -LRB- from proposed speeches -RRB- when people send it in there,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'm running against the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, very liberal.'' In <LOCATION> Karnack </LOCATION>, the ground trembled in vibration for 58 seconds as the motor of a Pershing II missile was ignited and burned its solid fuel rocket propellant. Bolted in concrete and steel, the motor remained stationary as it shot back a fiery tail and thick blossoms of white smoke. The motor of a less-powerful Pershing 1-A missile was destroyed the same way. It burned off in 37 seconds. After the firing, the Pershing 1-A motor was hauled by forklift to a crushing machine and destroyed. The larger Pershing II motor was to be destroyed later after it cooled down. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, standing on a speaker's platform 1,300 feet away, watched the firing through binoculars. When the smoke cleared, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, `` This has been a spectacular day. God bless you. This has been a great day.'' The Kremlin began destroying some of its missiles July 22 and as of Sept. 6 had eliminated 92 rockets. After viewing the rocket-engine crushing and pronouncing it `` well done,'' the vice president was presented with two metal fragments. He said he would give one to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and keep the other for himself. Soviet officials at the event also gave him fragments of their destroyed rockets. `` I hope the direction we're going in, in terms of destruction and verifiable reductions, continues,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` That was the message I got there today. And I think the Soviets felt the same way, the ones I talked to there.'' Under the treaty, signed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are required to destroy all nuclear missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles within three years. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and a team of Soviet inspectors from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> were flown here to witness the destruction of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons. `` We have become the eyewitnesses of significant events,'' said <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabolin </PERSON>, the chief Soviet inspector. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in brief remarks, said, `` We are witnessing today one of those unique moments in the career of man. ... This was the day we began to reverse the arms race; this was the day we began destroying the weapons of destruction.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then flew to <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, where he planned to address the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> women. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a crowd of about 200 well-wishers at the airport that `` <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is going to be a battleground.'' `` This is one of the critical four or five states in the entire country,'' he said.

 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> man was stripped of his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship Thursday after his attorney did not rebut government claims that he served as a guard at a Nazi death camp during World War II, federal prosecutors said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Clarkson </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> ordered 62-year-old <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reger </PERSON> denaturalized after a telephone conference during which <PERSON> Reger </PERSON>'s attorney did not contest government motions for summary judgment. Prosecutors alleged in court papers that <PERSON> Reger </PERSON> concealed his wartime activities as a member of the SS Death's Head Battalion and guard at the <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION> section of the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The government said <PERSON> Reger </PERSON> was a native of Filipovo, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. In court papers filed in February, <PERSON> Reger </PERSON> acknowledged being a member of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s SS but denied guarding prisoners at <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said in a statement. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reger </PERSON> is believed to be in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> was not available for further comment, and it was not immediately known what further action the government might take against <PERSON> Reger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reger </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Yardville </LOCATION>, has an unlisted telephone number and could not be reached for comment. His son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, a contractor, was not at home Thursday and a woman who said she was his wife declined to discuss the matter. <PERSON> Reger </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, did not return a telephone message left on his answering machine Thursday afternoon. Summary judgment occurs when attorneys ask that a judge rule in their favor based on documents and testimony presented before the case goes to trial. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> filed a complaint in December 1987 seeking <PERSON> Reger </PERSON>'s denaturalization. <ORGANIZATION> OSI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reger </PERSON> entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1952 and became an <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen in 1957. According to the complaint, <PERSON> Reger </PERSON>, beginning in 1943, guarded prisoners as they performed forced labor and were being transported between camps. The complaint accused him of no specific acts. In his application to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reger </PERSON> said he served in the 91st Grenadier Regiment of the German Army between 1943 and March 5, 1945, and as a Waffen-SS private until April 29 that year. <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> contended <PERSON> Reger </PERSON> should not have been allowed to become a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen because his activities during the war helped in the persecution of civilians because of their race, religion or national origin. The government's complaint said <PERSON> Reger </PERSON> joined the Waffen-SS in 1943 and served at <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION> until January 1945, when he left to guard a prisoner transport to another concentration camp. All documents related to the camps were destroyed by <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s SS, making it difficult to determine how many people died at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, but the figure is put at 4 million

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved amendments to an anti-drug bill Thursday that would permit federal death sentences for murderers in drug felonies and deny many federal benefits to anyone convicted of two narcotics offenses. Sponsors of the amendments rolled over opponents with arguments that these criminal and administrative penalties would deter those who use and profit from drugs. The death penalty amendment authored by Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON>, R-Pa., passed 299-111 and the benefit denials _ sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>. _ was approved The provisions were attached to a bill that would add some $ 2 billion to the nation's existing $ 3.9 billion attack on illegal drugs The House was unable to finish the bill Thursday night, and is not expected to resume debate until next Wednesday. Before ending debate, the lawmakers voted 259-134 for an amendment that would permit introduction of illegally seized evidence in federal court if police acted in `` good faith.'' Opponents of the benefit denials offered an amendment to water down the potential loss of student loans, public housing, veterans benefits and other federal assistance. But they could n't sway their colleagues, even by pointing out the amendment would prevent burial of Medal of Honor winners in Arlington National Cemetery. Battered death penalty opponents had argued that capital punishment would n't stop hardened drug killers from murdering someone. The death penalty provision would give federal judges the option of handing down a death sentence to anyone convicted of intentionally killing someone during a drug felony. The House also approved, 410-1, a measure providing for a mandatory life term for such killers. That language _ opposed by Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>. _ was proposed by death penalty foes as an alternative, but those backing capital punishment refused to stop there <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>'s amendment would deny benefits for five years for anyone convicted of two or more drug-related offenses within a 10-year period; and denial for 10 years for persons convicted of drug distribution. Heads of federal agencies could restore benefits for those who completed a drug rehabilitation program or were otherwise been rehabilitated. Veterans benefits would be denied only to those convicted of drug distribution. Retirement, welfare, health and disability benefits would be exempted from the penalty. <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON> argued that `` education and rehabilitation are not enough'' to stop demand and added, `` If we do n't have a deterrent, we wo n't win the war on the demand side. And if we do n't win on the demand side we wo n't win the war, period.'' Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lungren </PERSON>, R-Calif., asked if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> wanted to let a drug trafficker send the message that `` I got involved in drugs in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and therefore I'm excused. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, whose watered down version of the benefit denials failed 278-124, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that entire families in public housing could be thrown into the street if the head of household had two drug convictions. And he asked, `` Does it make any sense, on the eve of graduation, that we would cut off benefits'' to college students? <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON> said the death penalty amendment would provide a `` swift and certain'' deterrent against drug killings. A Democratic supporter, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said, `` Drug dealers do n't have to read anyone their rights. The drug dealers who kill have no conscience.'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the sentiment for capital punishment was linked to the upcoming election. `` We're now reaching the point, because it's on the eve of an election, that we may find ourselves thrown into a position where we have to explain to voters ... just who was the toughest on crime ... who was the toughest on drug traffickers,'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> argued. `` Sometimes it's those who say ` Let's kill the rascals' who prevail.'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said 36 states already have the death penalty, and `` if the other 14 states want it, they can get it.'' While the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has yet to consider its own anti-drug bill, it already has expressed sentiment on capital punishment this year. A separate bill approving the death penalty against drug dealers and kingpins passed in June by a 65-29 margin. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to support the death penalty in drug-related murders resulted in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> eliminating the measure from an anti-drug bill that year. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had inserted capital punishment in the 1986 bill by a vote of 296-112. Off the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, members were pressured by gun-control advocates and opponents over a provision for a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases. The language also includes an optional background check of the purchaser by law enforcement authorities. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is lobbying to remove the waiting period, and pro-regulation groups are trying to save it. Both sides have brought police officers to the Capitol to help in the lobbying effort. <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON>' death penalty provision would permit _ but not require _ a judge to impose the death sentence on anyone convicted of intentionally killing someone during a drug felony. If the death penalty was not imposed, the amendment would require a sentence of 20 years to life. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation approved last June would permit the death penalty for narcotics dealers convicted of murder in drug crimes; and for drug `` kingpins,'' defined under law as those who supervise five or more people, commit at least three federal drug felonies and derive substantial income from a continuing criminal enterprise. Most federal death penalty provisions are not enforceable because, unlike some state laws, they were never brought into compliance with <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> guidelines on capital punishment.

 A Vietnamese diplomat who allegedly waved a gun at protesters will surrender his immunity so British government officials can question him, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Vietnamese Ambassador <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hung </PERSON> `` handed over a toy gun which he said was the weapon the official had brandished'' in front of Vietnamese refugees demonstrating outside the Vietnamese Embassy on Sunday, a ministry spokesman said. During a meeting Thursday afternoon with Junior Minister <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON>, the ambassador agreed the diplomat, third secretary <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> <PERSON> Than </PERSON> <PERSON> Nhan </PERSON>, will surrender his immunity and visit the Foreign Office for questioning, said the spokesman. It has not yet been decided whether police will attend the interview, he said, speaking on condition he not be identified. The Foreign Office on Wednesday warned the ambassador he could expect `` the gravest consequences'' if he refused to allow the diplomat to be questioned. It also insisted the embassy surrender any other weapons. Vietnamese protesters sent two photographs of the diplomat holding a gun which were published Wednesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. The pictures showed a man with a pistol standing on the steps of the embassy. The paper said the demonstrators were Vietnamese refugees opposed to the current communist regime. Under the terms of the 1961 <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Convention on diplomatic practice, embassies are treated as foreign territory. Although diplomats and other embassy staff are required to obey local laws, they can not be prosecuted unless the country concerned agrees to waive their diplomatic immunity.

 Former leader <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> appears to be retaining some control over the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government and one suggestion in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> country's deepening crisis is for him to go into exile in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, a congressman just back from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said Wednesday. Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, told reporters that hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> have already demonstrated `` they are ready to lay down their lives'' for freedom, and the population will not retreat from demands for swift change from dictatorship to multi-party democracy. Also on Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved by unanimous consent a resolution introduced by <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> urging democratic change in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. The resolution called for `` the establishment of a transitional body, consisting of <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> citizens who are unquestionably committed to democracy and who have the confidence of the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> people, to organize the holding of multi-party elections and otherwise facilitate the establishment of a genuinely democratic government.'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs, met numerous prominent <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> during a 24-hour stopover in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> last weekend en route home from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. They included President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, Prime Minister Tun Tin and several student and opposition leaders, he said. A solution mentioned in the developing showdown is for Ne Win to leave <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, perhaps for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where he has spent time in the past, <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said. `` As for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the potential role they have to play is in terms of willingness _ if Ne Win expressed interest in leaving the country _ to facilitate resolution of the crisis in permitting him to go there,'' the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democrat said. If Ne Win decided to leave, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` is one of the places he might choose to go to. The other leading contender is <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said, recalling his conversations with Burmese. Although <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> resigned July 23 as head of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said his talks in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> gave him `` the impression that Ne Win continues to call the shots ... `` Virtually everybody I spoke to said he was not managing day to day affairs, but there was the sense that no decision may be made without his consent. There was also some evidence that key people in government are beating a steady path to his door,'' he said. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said the proposal of Ne Win's successors for a party congress next week followed by a referendum on multi-party democracy came too late and is `` utterly unacceptable to the people.'' This is because the government has lost all credibility and the proposal is regarded as a maneuver to cling to power, he said.

 River levels were stable or receding Thursday and the <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> airport reopened so relief supplies can be flown in, but distribution of aid to flood victims was slow and the death toll continued climbing. The government said 609 people have died in floods that began with the annual monsoon season in June, tapered off, then resumed in devastating fashion Aug. 27. Daily tallies by <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers total more than 1,300, which is considered more accurate. Information Minister <PERSON> Mahbubur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said Thursday 510 people drowned, died of snake bites or were killed when their houses collapsed. The government health center reported 99 deaths from diarrhea caused by drinking polluted water that flooded three-quarters of the country's 55,000 square miles. Health center officials reported 135,537 known cases of diarrhea nationwide, an increase of 15,715 in the previous 24 hours, but that includes only areas in communication with the capital. Officials say about one-quarter of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s 110 million people are homeless. Many still are stranded on rooftops, in boats and on the rare patches of high ground in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, most of which is a vast river delta. Water levels in flood areas range from a few inches to more than 10 feet. <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> insisted there was no shortage of water purification tablets, but his assertion seemed questionable. More than two dozen people interviewed at random Thursday in relief camps, flooded buildings and on rooftops in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> said they had no purification tablets and were drinking water that could be dangerous. `` Most of us have fevers and headaches,'' said <PERSON> Lily </PERSON>, a 17-year-old seamstress camping out at the Fair Fashion company factory with 10 co-workers. She said they paid 31 cents a day for about five gallons of tap water. <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> and a co-worker, 20-year-old <PERSON> Shamima </PERSON>, said they had heard of water purification tablets, but <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> said `` No one has given us any and we do n't have enough money to buy any.'' A diplomat from a Western nation that has tried to buy water purification tablets for relief distribution reported searching in vain for sufficient quantities in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and nearby countries. Representatives of other aid donors made similar reports, all on condition of anonymity. Pledges of disaster aid reached a total of at least $ 60 million Thursday, according to figures for individual nations reported by <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, the information minister. Included are $ 16.9 million in goods and cash from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, $ 3.6 million from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and $ 6.5 million each from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> societies. Much of the aid will take the form of food, blankets and medicine. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said it will send $ 11.9 million in new aid. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Thursday that the aid supplements $ 800,000 already pledged. Prospects for getting it to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> brightened with the opening of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>'s airport to all aircraft. More than half the 10,000-foot runway was flooded this week, and only helicopters and smaller commercial aircraft were landing. The World Food Program issued a statement in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> saying the greatest problem is moving the aid to where it is needed. `` Relief distribution is being carried out by boats, barges and tugs and a very limited number of helicopters,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency said. `` The government of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> has appealed for more logistical assistance.'' <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> told reporters neighboring countries agreed to study the flood problem in an effort to control the annual deluges carried by rivers that originate in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. He said the problem was put on the agenda of the December meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION>. The three mightiest rivers that run through the country to the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> are the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> and Meghna. Floods are a problem every monsoon season, but the inundation this year is the worst for many years in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, whose rivers cover 10 percent of its territory even in normal times. Rapid deforestation in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> has contributed to the problem because bare soil can not retain as much water, according to geographers, government officials and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> specialists. A report from the <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> flood warning and forecast center said the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Meghna </PERSON> continued receding slightly Thursday and the <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> held its level, with all three still above flood stage.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told war veterans Thursday he does not question <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s patriotism but `` I question his priorities,'' and said the massive federal debt threatens the nation's military strength. `` Military might can not be sustained without economic might,'' said the Democratic presidential nominee. `` We can not build a strong national defense on a mountain of debt.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received a polite, sometimes warm reception in an address to the annual convention of the American Legion, the nation's largest organization of veterans of war-time military service. He later flew to <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, to tour a General Motors engine plant, then attended a gala fund-raiser in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that the campaign said would raise $ 5 million for the fall effort. He shook hands with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who told reporters: `` I'm available to campaign ... upon request of the ticket. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> steered clear of mentioning in his speech the strategic weapons systems proposed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that he opposes _ such as the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles, and the Star Wars nuclear defense system. In a news conference later, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he supports continued Star Wars research at the reduced level of $ 1 billion a year but believes testing and deployment of such a nuclear-shield system would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which he supports as in the nation's best interest. `` If I made the judgment and if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made the judgment it was essential to our national security, then obviously we would proceed with it. But we do n't know that at this point,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has belittled the program, known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, in his campaign speeches. He has called it a `` fantasy'' and said the country needs `` star schools not Star Wars,'' while at the same time supporting continued research at 1982 levels. He faced repeated questioning about what appeared to be a change in tone if not position. He said he favored research as a way `` to keep our options open.'' `` I'm for continued research, but to commit billions that we do n't have ... to a system that is untested, untried and unproven, and which Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself apparently changed positions on a week ago, in my judgment does n't serve the national interest,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He referred to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recent remarks that suggested he was softening support for SDI deployment. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> followed by a day an appearance before the same group by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the vice president and Republican presidential nominee who has attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as soft on defense for opposing new weapons systems. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, an Army veteran, wore a Legion convention medal on his lapel and a pin commemorating soldiers missing in action _ but did not wear a legionnaire's cap _ during a speech that was interrupted repeatedly by applause. He critized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for misspending some defense money on weapons system that do n't work and attacked the administration and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for supporting cuts in veterans benefits, including cuts in the Veterans Administration hospital system. `` My opponent in this election is a patriotic man who served his country well in time of war,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I do not question his love for this country. But there are days _ and this is one of them _ when I question his priorities.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used similar words before the Legion, saying he did not question <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' patriotism but his support for a strong defense. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports a capital gains tax break that would benefit the wealthy, and compared that position with what he said was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vote to break a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> tie to cut <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> health care benefits by $ 2 billion and to eliminate cost of living increases for disabled veterans. `` What kind of priorities are those? A tax cut for those who have it made. A cut in income for those who lost a leg at <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> or were blinded at <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> or had an arm torn off at <LOCATION> Khe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sanh </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> praised the U.S.-Soviet treaty reducing intermediate-range nuclear missiles and said, `` I salute President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for it.'' But he said the country should strengthen conventional forces while working to `` build on that treaty.'' `` We can not rest here because today, after eight years and $ 2 trillion, we still do n't have an anti-tank weapon that can stop modern Soviet tanks. We have serious shortages in ammunition and spare parts and maintenance. We see billions being spent on weapons that do n't do what they are designed to do. And we see too many defense dollars slipping into the pockets of wheeler dealers and consultants,'' he said. At his news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made light of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s misstatement before the Legion group that Sept. 7 was the anniversary of the Japanese attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> The attack was on Dec. 7, 1941. `` I did n't know there were only 16 shopping days to Christmas until yesterday,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He shrugged off a question about the latest poll showing him eight points down, and the suggestion his campaign is in disarray. `` I do n't think we're slipping and I do n't think we're in disarray,'' he said.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Firefighters on Thursday for the first time closed all but a small piece of the oldest national park, devastated by fires that surrounded Old Faithful and charred more than 1 million acres. `` I've done this for 20 years and I've never seen anything as awesome as this,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>, operations chief on the 221,800-acre North Fork fire, which destroyed 17 buildings in the park Wednesday. Winds died down and temperatures cooled Thursday, and a weekend weather forecast called for rain or snow _ but also for winds up to 60 mph. `` It looks as if the burn that went through yesterday pretty much fire-proofed the Old Faithful area,'' North Fork commander <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said. `` The priorities have switched now that the fire has gone around here.'' Some firefighters and equipment that had been deployed around Old Faithful were moved elsewhere Thursday because of the reduced threat to the geyser development, officials said. Firefighters in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> used a helicopter and tracking dogs to search for a crewman missing from fire lines since Wednesday night, but reported that he returned to camp under his own power. About 150 residents evacuated Sunday from Silver Gate and <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, small <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> towns on the edge of the park, were allowed to go home, but a spot fire closed the highway. Firefighters used backfires Tuesday to save the towns. Fire officials warned that a wind shift could send the 119,000-acre Storm Creek-Hellroaring fire back at the canyon towns and force another evacuation. Fires also burned in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where four cabins were destroyed by flames. Although federal officials have called this the worst fire season in 30 years, no fatalities have been directly attributed to the blazes, which have charred 3.65 million acres, an area larger than <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. However, one man was killed Aug. 19 when a private helicopter crashed in the <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> on Aug. 19. The helicopter was on its way to a wilderness area to replace batteries in fire communications equipment. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is sending a Cabinet-level team to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to see what additional federal help is needed in fighting fires, and the White House said the number of troops on the fire line is likely to be increased. So far, about 2,500 military personnel are fighting fires. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> and Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> IV. The three plan to leave for <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. At <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, officials opened only an eight-mile section of road from the north entrance at <LOCATION> Gardiner </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> flats, and a 14-mile stretch from the west entrance to <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION>, park spokesmen said. Most of the 2.2 million-acre park, which includes about 250 miles of roadway, was closed to ensure an open path for fire trucks and to protect tourists from the roaring flames. Park officials said it is the first time such a large area in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> has been closed. The only tourist attraction open was Mammoth Hot Springs, which includes a hotel and campground, a restaurant, visitors center, employees dormitory and a small grocery store. Wind gusts up to 85 mph Wednesday briefly trapped some crews and tourists and destroyed 17 buildings. The strong wind knocked down trees in the complex, including a 50-foot pine next to the main entrance of historic Old Faithful Inn. The building was not damaged, and tourists had evacuated earlier. `` Trees were just popping like matchsticks,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a firefighter from <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. Firefighters on Thursday hosed down the still-smoldering rubble of nearby cabins, many with only metal fixtures and bed springs identifiable. Crews also cleared fuel in the complex around the park's most famous attraction. Heavy smoke blanketed the area, and small licks of fire could be seen in many spots on either side of the road. Flames continued to threaten the structures remaining, said <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>, the fire operations chief. In <LOCATION> Bridger-Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, where missing crewman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Alire </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rito </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, returned unharmed to camp around noon, authorities said they planned to investigate his disappearance from the fire lines Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s Glacier National Park, firefighters struggled to flank the 14,000-acre <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bench </ORGANIZATION> forest fire that has burned more than a dozen homes, but officials were reluctant to assign crews to the leading edge of the fire. `` In a situation like this when you've got 20 mph winds and a large, very dry area of lodgepole pine, the only things that will slow it down are rain, humidity and natural barriers,'' information officer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said. About 1,400 firefighters were on the lines of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s 238,400-acre Canyon Creek fire near the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> border, which was mostly stalled by cool temperatures Thursday Fires have burned about 200,000 acres in the rugged canyons of central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, including seven wilderness fires in the <ORGANIZATION> Nez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> that continue to burn out of control. The Entiat fire in the <LOCATION> Swakane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> area of central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is the state's biggest forest fire, and has consumed 36,170-acres of wildlife habitat. Five other blazes, mostly contained, have burned about 70,000 acres.

 A woman whose car was seized at the border because agents found two 50-cent pipes from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> says the agency carried Zero Tolerance too far. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> confirmed that no drugs were found but said <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s car was seized Sunday because of `` paraphernalia.'' Custom officials said Thursday the car would be returned. Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who lives in suburban <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that her friend, <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantrell </PERSON>, bought the pipes in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where the two had gone shopping. `` It's appalling,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 27, a clerical worker at a <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> law office. `` I'm an American citizen, and I should have rights. First off, they -LRB- the pipes -RRB- were not even mine.'' Ms. <PERSON> Cantrell </PERSON>, 23, who also does clerical work at the law office, said the onyx pipes were among several knick-knacks she bought and were a gift for a friend. Ms. <PERSON> Cantrell </PERSON> said neither she or Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> use drugs. The seizure, at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> port of entry at <LOCATION> Progreso </LOCATION>, stems from the administration's Zero Tolerance policy, designed to curtail the demand for drugs, Customs spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said. Customs officials announced Thursday afternoon that they would release the car back to Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> if she or someone else returns to Progreso and claims it, and <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said it had been decided that no charges would be filed. `` That seizure has been canceled by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said. `` We considered all the facts involved and the circumstances in the case and came to the conclusion that the seizure did not fit the spirit and intent of the Zero Tolerance program.'' <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said he was not aware of any decision to reimburse Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> for her additional travel expenses. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> is about 350 miles from <LOCATION> Progreso </LOCATION>. The women said they had been told that the car, on which Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> still owes $ 5,800, would be put up for auction if the appeal was rejected. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, had said the matter was being looked into. He added that five complaints had been received in the last month about seizures along the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said that from March 21, when Zero Tolerance took effect, through June, 474 vehicles have been seized in the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s southwest region _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

 A transcript of cockpit conversation on <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 reveals the crew knew their jetliner was in serious trouble about 21 seconds before it crashed Aug. 31 at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported Thursday. The transcript of a tape shows that about nine seconds after an apparently normal takeoff, a cockpit alarm showed the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 was not able to gather enough speed to stay aloft, the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Salt Lake City-bound plane exploded and exploded and broke apart on impact, killing 13 of the 108 people on board. Eleven secords before impact, Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lon </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> exclaimed, `` We're not gunna make it!'' One of the final entries on the transcript appears to be a scream. The unauthorized release of the transcript drew sharp criticism from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, who warned, `` There will probably be some repercussions.'' It will be months before investigators pinpoint the cause of the crash, but two primary suspects have emerged. They are wing flaps, designed to give the plane lift, and engine problems during the flight. The transcript reveals that flight engineer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> and co-pilot <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> went through a standard preparation checklist. In the transcript, <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> told <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> that the flaps were extended in the correct position for normal takeoff during the checklist less than a minute before the plane received permission for takeoff. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators said last week that the cockpit recording indicates there were two compressor stalls, which are disruptions of air flow, one each in two of the engines. The transcript, however, notes five possible compressor stalls within six seconds, a set of two followed within seconds by three more, the newspaper reported. Investigators have not been able to determine whether any compressor stalls actually occurred, safety board officials said. The engines are to be tested at the <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON> said he believes the transcript, which he said appears to be a very relevant portion of the cockpit tape, may have been released `` to point the finger -LRB- of blame -RRB- away from whoever was doing the leaking,'' but said he would not speculate on who that may have been The release of one piece of evidence in an investigation that make take nearly a year is `` folly'' and may lead people to draw wrong and unfair conclusions, <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON> said. `` This has happened many times in the past, and we've complained many times in the past,'' <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON> said. He said the pilots union may consider filing a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which is investigating the crash, about the transcript's early release. `` We got it from an investigator,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON>, an assistant managing editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, but the newspaper would not disclose what agency the investigator worked for. A spokesman for the transportation safety board in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said the board also is upset that a major portion of the transcript was leaked to the newspaper. `` We're upset because that transcript is an unauthorized, preliminary and incomplete version,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. `` By law, that transcript is not to be released for 60 days. We make every effort to ensure the transcript is confidential.'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said there is no way to determine who gave the transcript to the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` A number of parties have access to that transcript,'' including the pilots union, he said. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials are reviewing security procedures to see if they must be changed to prevent such documents from being leaked to the press in the future.

 Syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> was rushed to <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> when he fainted after giving a speech Thursday night, hospital officials said. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s condition and the cause of his collapse were not immediately available, but <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtzke </PERSON> said the columnist was `` alert, he's conscious, he's sitting up. An ambulance dispatcher, who would not give his name, said <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> was taken to the hospital about 9:11 p.m. EDT for apparent heat exhaustion. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> was leaving a lecture hall at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> after giving a speech on the presidential campaign when he collapsed, a student who was nearby said. `` He walked up the stairs, paused, and was leaning forward over a sign,'' said <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpf </PERSON>, a freshman at American. `` He said, ` Oh, it's kind of warm in there,' and he was n't feeling well,'' she said `` I looked back over, and he was lying on the ground.'' `` He was holding his chest,'' <PERSON> Karpf </PERSON> said. `` Nobody really knew what was going on.

About a dozen people were around <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> trying to ask questions when he collapsed, she said. `` He was conscious when they took him away,'' in the ambulance, <PERSON> Karpf </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, 52, has been the target of national publicity recently for shooting a teenage intruder who had taken an unauthorized midnight dip in <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s back yard swimming pool. The columnist, generally known for his liberal views and an outspoken opponent of handgun use, is scheduled to stand trial Sept. 22 on charges that he used an unregistered handgun and ammunition in the June 14 shooting. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> has argued that the weapon and bullets were given to him by his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, who has said he was told by <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> officials that he did not have to register the weapon.

The storm center was near latitude 24.5 north and longitude 89.2 west. Forecaster <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said air currents high above <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> were blowing the top off its thunderstorms, keeping winds from intensifying to the 74 mph level that would classify the system as a hurricane. `` Right now it's maintaining the status quo,'' <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said. He added that because of weak steering currents, it was impossible to predict where the storm was headed. `` We're still looking at a threat, but we do n't know what direction it is going to take,'' <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said. He said it was not unusual for a storm to stall in the Gulf for several days before moving toward land. The <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> would be closed Friday because of high tides caused by the approaching tropical storm. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodiel </PERSON> said she did not know how long the park, which is on the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, would be closed. <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> is the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season. Only Debby, which also formed in the Gulf, reached minimal hurricane status briefly. The 12th and 13th tropical depressions of the season formed in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> late Thursday afternoon. The 12th was centered about 300 miles east-southeast of <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> with top winds of about 30 mph. The depression was drifting westward at 10-15 mph and was expected to continue this motion for the next 24 hours. The 13th depression was located about 400 miles northeast of the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off the west coast of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, moving north at 20-25 mph with winds of 35 mph. The system was not expected to intensify, forecasters said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sued <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and its top officials Thursday, alleging that the county's 1981 redistricting plan has denied Hispanics equal voting rights The lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, seeks to invalidate the electoral boundaries set for the county's five elected supervisors, and to devise a new plan that complies with federal law. <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> said the lawsuit was expected, and added it is `` unfortunate that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has elected to take its action so near to the 1990 census.'' Supervisor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonovich </PERSON> agreed, saying `` It makes more sense to wait 16 months for the next census than to use antiquated statistics from 1980 as the basis for reapportionment.'' <PERSON> Antonovich </PERSON> also denied that there has been any pattern of racial discrimination by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>. However, leaders of local Hispanic and civil rights groups welcomed the suit as long overdue. `` I think it makes it utterly uncontestable that there can be a continuation of the white enclave that has governed <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The 1981 districts were `` gerrymandered to dilute the power of latino communities to elect a leader of their own choosing,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> representative for the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>. A discrimination case also was filed against the county last month by the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, which called the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> `` the most exclusive, most powerful whites-only club in the nation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s suit most likely be consolidated with the suit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MALDEF </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said. The county, which has an annual operating budget of about $ 8.9 billion, comprises an estimated 8.5 million residents, with each supervisor representing between 1.6 million and 1.7 million people, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> said. A similar <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> discrimination suit was filed aginst the city of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1985, leading to a settlement that radically revised <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> districts in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The federal lawsuit charges that the county's electoral plan fragments the county's geographically cohesive Hispanic community, thus denying Hispanics an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice to the county governing body. Named as defendants, in addition to the county, were the Board of Supervisors; <PERSON> Dana </PERSON>; <PERSON> Antonovich </PERSON>; and Supervisors <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabarum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, and Registar-Recorder <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Weissburd </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schabarum </PERSON> did not immediately respond to a telephone call seeking comment, and <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> declined to comment. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said in a prepared statement, `` I believe this could have been avoided if this past June 21st, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> had approved my motion to place a measure on the November ballot to expand the board to seven members.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suit alleges that in 1970, Hispanics numbered 1,289,311, or 18.3 percent of the total population. In 1980, the suit says, the county's Hispanic population rose to 2,066,103, or 27.6 percent of the total population of 7,477,503. Blacks comprised 12.4 percent, or 926,361, and Asians and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> 5.8 percent, 434,850, of the 1980 population. The suit says the Hispanic population stretched from the City of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on the west to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> on the east, comprising about 73 percent of the more than 1.2 million people residing in the 230 contiguous census tracts and constituting what is called a `` community of interest.'' The 1981 reapportionment plan adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> divided the concentration of Hispanic voters into three districts, with the result that <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> did not constitute a voting-age majority or plurality in any of the five single-member districts. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> charged that the county also has systemically discriminated against Hispanics in its employment policies. He cited a recent study that found that Hispanics make up about 18.3 percent of the government's work force, while county hiring goals call for a 27.6 percent representation. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> complaint says that non-partisan elections in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, including those for the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>, are characterized by patterns of racial and ethnic bloc voting.

What I'm doing is opening my eyes and my heart to everything that I am and have been,'' he said. <PERSON> Dinkjian </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Nutley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, has a diverse musical background. At age 5 he performed at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s Fair as part of an Armenian ensemble and grew up listening to the Beatles and jazz. He studied Western classical music in college. In Night Ark, <PERSON> Dinkjian </PERSON> plays a variety of exotic <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stringed instruments _ oud, cumbus, canoon, saz _ and writes and arranges most of the four-piece band's music. Keyboardist <PERSON> Armen </PERSON> <PERSON> Donelian </PERSON> and percussionist <PERSON> Arto </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuncboyaci </PERSON> share <PERSON> Dinkjian </PERSON>'s Armenian heritage, while bassist <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuller </PERSON> finds in Night Ark an opportunity to explore new sounds and technique. While the band members decline to call their music jazz, they perform mostly in jazz clubs, and Night Ark's two albums on the RCA Novus label are targeted primarily at jazz audiences. Those audiences, <PERSON> Dinkjian </PERSON> says, are generally receptive to Night Ark's often unconventional rhythms and melodies At its best, Night Ark plays a distinctive and frequently compelling music reminiscent of the Turkish-inspired jazz played a number of years ago by flutist <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>. But at its worst, the band drifts into lazy renditions of timeworn pop standards, producing a music that ends up sounding like some uninspired New Age elevator music. `` The major disappointment is in the squandering of talent and ideas on a lame version of <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s ` You've Got a Friend,''' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnally </PERSON> reviewing Night Ark's second album, `` Moments,'' in <LOCATION> Jazziz </LOCATION> magazine. But, performing recently at the jazz club Fat Tuesday's, Night Ark relied on its original compositions to charm receptive listeners. Night Ark _ the name is a reference to biblical <PERSON> Noah </PERSON>'s Ark, which, legend has it, came to rest on <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ararat </LOCATION> _ retains several <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> musical fundamentals to produce its sound. `` Between two adjacent notes on a piano, there's an infinite amount of notes'' that are inaccessible to Western instruments but can be played by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> musicians, <PERSON> Dinkjian </PERSON> said. `` Sometimes when people hear an Arabic song it sounds out of tune,'' he said. `` The reason why my music does n't sound strange is that I have slipped in all of those funny notes but carefully added the harmony behind it. We've kind of buffered it.'' Night Ark also employs rhythms unusual in Western music. `` This is not a jazz fusion gimmick; this is the beat I was brought up with,'' <PERSON> Dinkjian </PERSON> said. The insistent percussion `` is not alienating the Western audience, but tries to bring them in and say ` Welcome. You're going to like this.'''

<HEAD>Moyers' Eclectic New Interview Series on PBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Yes, after a while it does get to be tedious, praising all these <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> programs on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>, informing the deprived TV populace that they are missing some of the best stuff on television by not switching that selector away from <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> or Fox or HBO. <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>' Constitution series was fascinating. The <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> interviews were inspired. Could n't <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>, just once, produce some kind of lame drivel that could be lambasted for a change? Apparently not, at least for now. <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> embarks Monday on a new series of interviews, `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>' World of Ideas,'' with an eclectic group of guests, though judging from the first few shows, they seem to have a common theme about ethics and societal responsibilities. The series of nightly, half-hour interviews continues for 10 weeks. If that seems like a lot, figure it's worth it to check in once in a while when you're likely to drop in on a conversation with anybody from sportswriter <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> to Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Most of the interview subjects are authors, some scientists and others philosophers. In the first week, <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> talks to British film producer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON>, environmental scientist <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuchman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>, ethicist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Josephson </PERSON> and historian <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> <PERSON> Commager </PERSON>. Part 2 of the <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> interview rounds out the week. In Monday's premiere, <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON>, producer of `` Chariots of Fire,'' `` The Killing Fields'' and `` The Mission,'' discusses what he sees as the moral decay of the movie industry, a degeneration of message to money. <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> knows whereof he speaks since he won an Oscar and later became head of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, only to be bounced out for going against the system. <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Both recall images from the silver screen that strongly affected their sense of the world. It is this often profound effect on the formation of ideals, <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> argues, for which the filmmaker must take responsibility. Instead, he argues, many moviemakers sneer at audiences while picking their pockets. `` We've all got to look past this thing and say, well, where are we going to be in the year 2000?'' he says. `` Are we literally going to live in tiny enclaves with individual armed guards, pouring rubbish over the fence in the form of television material, films or even journalism at an undereducated and increasingly irresponsible society on the outside?'' `` But I go to the movies to be entertained,'' <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> counters, `` not to be lectured. Do I really want <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> sitting there saying, ` What kind of moral instruction can I give <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> when pays me seven dollars?''' `` No, you do n't,'' says <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON>. `` You have every right not to want that, but, again, I think there's an underlying poverty of ambition, if you like. I've never accepted that there's any dichotomy at all between entertaining you, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>, and also dealing in an issue, addressing you with an issue. I do n't think there's any dichotomy at all, and I think it's the job of the responsible filmmaker _ or of the good filmmaker, forget ` responsible' _ to deal in both.'' <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> admits he tripped in the moral mine field when he made `` Midnight Express'' to prove he was n't just a maker of `` art'' films, and could produce a commercial hit. The movie was about a young American, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, imprisoned in a hellish Turkish jail for drug smuggling. In the climactic scene, <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> bites off the tongue of one of his tormentors. <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> meant the scene as a horrific portrayal of how demented <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> had become in the brutal prison world. But <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> was appalled when he sat in a movie house and heard the audience cheer the scene. `` That's when I said to myself, ` Never again.' I do n't ever want to sit and look at a film that I've had any responsibility at all for and be stunned and shattered by the reaction it's getting from the audience,'' he said. In the second half of the interview, <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> expresses regret for turning down `` Moonstruck'' when he was at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, though he says the script he saw was n't as good as the movie turned out to be. He also says he did n't think `` Chariots of Fire'' deserved the Oscar as Best Picture when it won in 1981. Between it and the later runner-up in that category, `` The Killing Fields,'' <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON> says, they did add up to one Academy Award. <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>' other guests in the next few weeks will include, among many others, American authors <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> and <PERSON> E.L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doctorow </PERSON>, Nigerian novelist <PERSON> Chinua </PERSON> <PERSON> Achebe </PERSON>, author and scientist <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Asimov </PERSON>, author and historian <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuchman </PERSON>, Mexican author <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, British historian <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and philosopher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>.

 The workers at <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant have found out they can get along just fine without bosses. For the past two years, the plant has been run by `` self-directed'' work groups made up of the 150 or so employees who make industrial and automotive rubber hoses. It has been a successful experiment, says plant manager <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, one that is being used at other <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> plants. `` There was just dissatisfaction with the way things were done,'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. `` This plant used to have traditional supervisors.'' `` Basically it was a parent-child relationship,'' he said. `` You know, the old ` I'm the boss and you do what I say.''' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said that approach was not popular with employees, several of whom were attending nearby <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think what really happened was, as the education level and expectations of our employees grew, the work place was n't keeping up with their ability to function in that work place,'' he said. In 1984, the company decided to launch a `` supervisorless team'' made up of `` people that all had that can-do, a little bit of rebels, the people that were really the free spirits,'' said <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>. The experiment, which stresses more employee involvement in the running of plant operations, was considered so successful that three more work teams were formed over the next two years. Instead of having middle-level management positions such as production managers and floor supervisors, each work team chooses a `` coordinator'' who brings to <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> the group's ideas and complaints. `` The challenge we make to every person is: Do n't ever put that coordinator in the position of being an old supervisor,'' he said. `` You're not fulfulling your responsibility as an employee if you put that guy in a supervisory mode.'' The self-directed work teams may appear to mirror the way some Japanese companies run their operations, but <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> and officials at company headquarters in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said the idea is not the result of Japanese philosophy. `` ... As far as we're concerned it's an evolution of what needed to be done in an American factory,'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. `` It had nothing to do with the Japanese way of doing things.'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, who has been plant manager for about a year since moving from <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, said production has increased more than 40 percent since 1985. Absenteeism and accidents also have declined during that time, he said. In <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Fair </PERSON>, director of public relations for the company, and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, director of organization development, said many of the company's 48 plants in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are `` embracing the system in varying degrees.'' `` We think we have a very successful system at Mount Pleasant. It's on the leading edge of all the systems,'' said <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. `` The Mount Pleasant plant, overall, is considered a good plant.'' Fair said employees at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION> and at other <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> plants, such as in <LOCATION> Hannibal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, have adopted `` an entrepreneurial attitude'' as a result of the work teams. `` They view themselves as managing their own jobs,'' he said. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said it goes beyond that, however. `` We operate on the principal of trust and mutual respect. We trust that our employees will do what is expected of them, what is right, what is fair,'' he said. `` Fairness is the principal,'' said <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>. `` If you violate that trust, we do n't give second chances.'' The system has made employees more than clock punchers working three shifts a day, nearly seven days a week, he said. `` They really have a fierce sense of ownership of this plant,'' he said. `` They have a fierce sense of loyalty here in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>.''

 Airline pilots, weary from flying many hours across multiple time zones, often wander out of assigned air space, land on wrong runways and even fall asleep at the controls of planes carrying hundreds of passengers. A review of sleep research and interviews with researchers and pilots by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> found the significance of fatigue, long a problem in air travel, has grown along with the deregulated airline industry. Government documents obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> describe some 600 incidents over the last five years, an average of two a week, in which air crews blamed fatigue for potentially dangerous mistakes in navigation, communications and piloting. While never officially listed as a cause in any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial aviation accident, fatigue has been linked to several incidents. A still unreleased report by the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> cites fatigue as a factor in the Dec. 12, 1985, crash in <LOCATION> Gander </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, of a charter plane carrying 248 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen and a crew of eight home for Christmas from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Many people interviewed blame airline deregulation for the mounting reports of fatigue. Deregulation brought a competitive explosion in air travel, and pilots contend their airlines try to lower costs by working them harder, sometimes with schedules that keep them flying all night and into the next day. These work hours, say the pilots, affect their concentration. `` When you're fatigued, you get distracted easily. You'll miss a radio call, or enter the wrong data or read it wrong,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Linsley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> captain and a pilot's union spokesman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` Then you get into physical problems, hitting the wrong switch, over-controlling the aircraft, sometimes turning the wrong way or busting an altitude. `` It comes down to both of you sitting at the controls and shaking your heads to stay on top of things.'' <PERSON> Linsley </PERSON> was among two dozen pilots interviewed by the AP. Many talked of falling asleep in the cockpit. `` I've flown trips that were n't safe because we were all so exhausted,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> captain, who asked not to be identified. `` I've flown trips that leave at midnight with three legs -LRB- takeoffs and landings -RRB- and you arrive at noon, feeling like a piece of dog meat.'' Pilots are n't alone in their concern. Researchers such as <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> psychologist <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Graeber </PERSON> believe pilots often fly beyond their endurance. `` I am convinced that serious errors occur that are facilitated by fatigue, sleep loss, jet lag, whatever you want to call it,'' said <PERSON> Graeber </PERSON>, lead scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> NASA-Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Moffett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines have the world's best safety record, <PERSON> Graeber </PERSON> and others worry that pilots' schedules do n't consider the grinding, numbing effects that 15-hour days, abrupt shift changes or multiple time zone travel can have. The pilots agree. `` Sometimes, if you've flown several legs and had a rough day with bad weather, you realize you're not seeing things you're supposed to see,'' said an Eastern captain who asked not to be identified `` I've flown at 2 in the morning when I realize I've fallen into a hypnotic state I've been on airplanes where I do n't remember the last three legs from the night before. Fatigue contributed to at least two recent air accidents: _ The <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> crash of the Arrow Air DC-8, taking off for <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>, Ky. The preliminary report, as yet unreleased and subject to modification, blames icing and crew fatigue, noting the crew flew an exhausting schedule in the previous 12 days, including short layovers, multiple time zones and excessive flight hours. The report cites a `` high potential for the development of chronic fatigue'' among the crew and says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flight-time limitations `` do not reflect recent advances in the understanding of the deleterious effects of fatigue.'' _ The Feb. 19, 1985, `` inflight upset'' of a <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 747 flying from <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators said that after a simple engine flameout, the crew relied too long on autopilot to adjust the plane's bearing. When the captain finally took over, the 220-ton aircraft rolled over into a six-mile nosedive that approached the speed of sound before control was regained 9,500 feet above the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The plane was extensively damaged and two people were seriously injured. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> noted that five days before the accident, the captain had flown through five time zones on a return from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and then had flown several flights between <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. While the report stopped short of blaming fatigue, board member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON>, a sleep scientist, believes it was a factor. `` You go through that whole sequence and it's strongly suggestive of a crew that were n't plugged in and who probably were n't plugged in because of sleepiness,'' he said. Fatigue may have been involved in other accidents as well, including the Sept. 25, 1978, collision between a <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> 727 and a private plane and the Oct. 31, 1979, crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. On the night before the PSA accident, which killed 146 people, the crew had barely seven hours off duty and likely slept no more than 5 -LCB- hours. The next day, the pilot was heard saying on the cockpit tape, `` I'm draggin'. It was a short night.'' The Western crash occurred at 5:30 a.m. when the DC-10, having flown about three hours from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, landed on the wrong runway and hit a truck. Seventy-three people died.

 Both accidents were blamed on pilot error. Experts say hard evidence rarely exists to show pilots erred because they were tired. `` The problem with fatigue is it's not a bent piece of metal. It's not a liquid that can be analyzed in the laboratory,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> official who heads aerospace medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Government and airline officials acknowledge they've heard tales of pilots napping in flight and of mistakes attributed to sleepiness, but they play down such reports. `` There is n't evidence that there is a fatigue problem,'' said <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group representing the major airlines. <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, says more research is needed into the effects of long flights on the circadian system, or biological clock. But he denies a safety problem. `` There's no evidence that shows it makes flying any more hazardous,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. Some 600 accounts of missed approaches, near misses and near tragedies blamed on fatigue show up in voluntary pilot reports filed with the Air Safety Reporting System, an office run by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> for pilots who want to confess to mistakes and report risky conditions without fear of retribution. Enough reports were filed by crews for commuter airlines and air taxis that the <ORGANIZATION> ASRS </ORGANIZATION> sent a memo to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in May identifying `` recurring pilot deviations directly attributable to fatigue and cockpit workload.'' `` The big chunk that we have perceived out of this information is that fatigue is a real issue that needs to be addressed,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynard </PERSON>, who runs the reporting system. Even though the reports are protected by anonymity and are not investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> ASRS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reynard </PERSON> believes they are truthful. `` It is absolutely, positively valid that these numbers are real,'' he said. `` Our analysts have been in aviation for 20 to 30 years. They are very good at spotting a ringer.'' The reports provide a litany of horror stories: _ In February 1987, the co-pilot of a cross-country jumbo jet already descending into <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> looks up from his coffee cup to see the captain asleep at the controls. `` I think we need to look at the world of the pilot and see what more hours and labor unrest is doing,'' he writes. _ The next month a large airliner from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> sinks 4,000 feet below its assigned altitude, coming close enough to another plane to set off alarms at the air traffic control center. `` I do not believe it would have occurred to a rested crew,'' writes a crewmember, noting he flew all night to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> then continued to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> into the morning sun. `` Duty regulations.. do not in any way address the debilitating effects of flying all night and especially of continuing to work into the morning hours.'' _ Last November the co-pilot of another large jet begins a takeoff roll from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> without setting the flaps, an error then already suspected in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 crash in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> that had killed 154 people three months earlier. Cockpit warning horns sound and takeoff is aborted. In the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> crash, the horns failed to sound. `` It is quite sobering to consider that the combination of fatigue and distractions could so easily cause a breakdown in my own cockpit discipline,'' writes the co-pilot, who had flown for three days with little sleep. `` Complacency was not a factor,'' he writes. `` Simple fatigue was the culprit.'' That incident affords a good look at the shadowy effects of fatigue. Planes do n't crash because pilots are tired, say the experts. Fatigue becomes a killer only when something else _ equipment or the weather _ goes wrong as well. If, for example, the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> flight's warning horns had failed, as they did in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, the tired pilot's oversight could have been fatal. In the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> crash, there was no evidence fatigue played a role. On paper, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> flight rules seem favorable to pilots. Domestic pilots are limited to eight hours' flight time a day; overseas pilots fly no more than 12. All pilots must get at least eight hours of rest between flight sequences. However, the regulations count only scheduled flight time, not the hours spent on the ground between flights. So scheduled turnarounds and unscheduled delays can push a crew's day up to 16 hours. Scheduling agreements between airlines and pilots once kept flight hours well below federal standards, but concessions to management have become commonplace amid the fierce competition brought on by deregulation. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said that 10 years ago, at the start of deregulation, the typical contract limited flight time to a maximum of 75 to 80 hours per month. Today, he says, it's 80-85 hours. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> pilots, who lost their contract when the company reorganized in 1983, now fly 20 percent more hours a month. The company says its flight hours are still well under the industry average. `` Our ... work rules remove the anti-productivity aspects to allow reasonable productivity,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>. Northwest pilots complain their company has interpreted regulations to allow international crews flying home to take on additional domestic flights, adding up to four flight hours to their day. Northwest, citing ongoing negotiations with the pilots, declined to comment. When <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> routes in 1986, its pilots faced extended flight hours and reduced crew size on the longer routes. A separate contract added a day of work each month. `` The Pan Am guys had a cushy job, but the company fell on hard times,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s director of flight operations. `` We're trying to strike a balance between what's fair and equitable for the pilots and what's economical.'' Many pilots interviewed complain the scales are tipped too far toward economics at the expense of safety. `` I've got 400 people in that airplane and I take it very seriously,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 747 pilot. `` It's a responsibility, and you know this is n't good for the passengers.''

 Concern shimmered in the words of the pilot, who was writing after spending 30 of the last 48 hours on duty, flying his commuter plane in and out of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` I found myself continuously asking the first officer if I had performed certain duties or functions because I just could n't remember,'' he wrote `` You have an accident waiting to happen.'' The pilot's warning was among hundreds of reports detailing pilot fatigue received by a little-known organization that monitors safety in the nation's sky. The Air Safety Research System, established by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and run by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, has collected 95,000 written reports over 12 years, ranging from admissions of missed paperwork to confessions of near misses. The montage of mistakes, gripes and pointers has become an essential tipster's sheet to problems in the air traffic system. The information comes voluntarily from pilots who are guaranteed anonymity and limited immunity for the mistakes they describe. `` Our basic function is to provide a place to which people in the aviation system can report in confidence, without fear of reprisal,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynard </PERSON>, the head of the program. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> began the system in 1975 but got little response because it offered only limited confidentiality. Since <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> assumed administration of the system the next year, pilots who report errors have been promised limited immunity, although that has been extended in less than 2 percent of the cases. The system goes to great lengths to protect pilots' anonymity. The compiled reports mention no names or airlines; even the time of day is blocked out. The place, month and year where the incident took place are listed along with the weight class of the aircraft involved. Yet the message comes through: The pilot of a jumbo jet bound for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> confesses to flying 1,500 feet above his assigned altitude. `` We were lucky there were no other aircraft in our area,'' he wrote, noting his crew had flown 23 hours in three days. `` I have to attribute it to fatigue and @ or jet lag.'' The pilot of a small jetliner reports he incorrectly decided to continue a botched approach to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, landing too fast nearly halfway down the runway. `` My poor judgment was caused in major part by fatigue,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Reynard </PERSON> believes the credibility of such reports. `` It's very, very rare that somebody would make up something and then confess to it,'' he said. The reports go to the <ORGANIZATION> ASRS </ORGANIZATION> office at <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for review by analysts with aviation backgrounds. They often call the pilots for additional information. If something needs immediate attention, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials are informed. Special study groups look into chronic problems such as multiple reports of planes landing or taxiing on the wrong runways. The database is also tapped by investigators at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Last year, for example, after a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 crashed at <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Metropolitan Airport, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> requested a computer search for any reports mentioning that airport. The safety system provided The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> with all files detailing instances of pilot fatigue collected since 1983. About 2 percent of all reports collected since then involve some mention of crew fatigue. <PERSON> Reynard </PERSON> said analysts watch for the possiblity of false reports filed in the often hostile environment of airline union-management conflicts. `` We know when we're being campaigned by someone trying to make a point,'' said <PERSON> Reynard </PERSON>. `` Even if they tried, our analysts are too experienced to let something fictitious get through.

 The crash of an jetliner in <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> three years ago that killed 256 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and crew members resulted in part from the exhaustion of the flight crew, who ignored ice on the plane's wings, according to a preliminary Canadian report A still-unreleased draft report by the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> noted the crew had flown a grueling schedule in the two weeks before the accident. Had they finished the trip, the captain would have been awake 24 hours. `` I think these people were tired,'' Dr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` They had been on a series of flights prior to that, which were fatiguing. I just think they needed a good night of sleep.'' <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON>, head of aerospace medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, advised the Canadian board on fatigue factors in the crash. The plane, an Arrow Air charter, crashed Dec. 12, 1985, while taking off from a refueling stop at <LOCATION> Gander </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, killing everyone aboard. The plane was ferrying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from peace-keeping duties in the Sinai peninsula to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. The preliminary report lists ice on the wings of the plane as the principal cause of the crash. But it says that a too-slow takeoff speed and flight-crew fatigue were contributing factors. Spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said the board hopes to release a final version of the report in early December. `` It may bear no similarity to the draft report,'' he said. `` In fact, it wo n't. It will be quite different.'' He said he did not know whether fatigue would still be listed as a contributing cause. The draft report said that twice in the two weeks before the crash, the crew had flown longer than allowed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulations. According to federal rules, no crew member may be on duty aloft for more than 12 hours in any 24-hour period. If the flight had made it to <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, its final planned stop, the crew would have flown about 15 hours and been on duty for 20. However, because the plane would have carried no passengers on its final leg, this trip would not have violated federal limits. The board could not determine with certainty whether the pilot, co-pilot or flight engineer were truly fatigued. However, it cited <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON>'s testimony that `` in the 12 days leading up to the accident, the flight crew had been consistently exposed to work patterns and fatigue-producing factors which were highly conducive to the development of chronic fatigue.'' These included short layovers, night departures, multiple time-zone crossings and almost 57 hours in the air in the previous 10 days. In one 48-hour period that month, the crew flew for more than 22 hours, then were back in the cockpit seven hours later. The report said that at Gander the crew failed to notice ice on the wings, which prevented the plane from gaining altitude after it lifted off, and they set the wrong takeoff speed. `` Each of those would be consistent with tired pilots,'' <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON> said. `` Tired pilots do things like that. They omit things. They make mistakes.''

<TEXT>
 Backstage at the <ORGANIZATION> Worcester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centrum </ORGANIZATION>, a few hundred yards from the hastily constructed ring where in a few hours the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Circus was to begin its first American tour in a decade, <PERSON> Slava </PERSON> <PERSON> Zolkin </PERSON> leaned near a cage and kissed one of his 12 dancing brown bears between the eyes. Immediately, the other bears emitted jealous growls of protest until <PERSON> Zolkin </PERSON> came by and stroked each one. `` I love them a lot and they love me,'' said <PERSON> Zolkin </PERSON>, 39, a former tightrope artist who began teaching bears to perform after he fell off the wire and broke his back in four places. <PERSON> Zolkin </PERSON>, who wears a bear keychain around his waist and hands out bear pins to visitors, said through an interpreter that he never uses force to train his bears to dance and juggle with their feet. He chooses his bears as cubs and they live with him, his wife and daughter in their three-room apartment in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, until they grow too big. <PERSON> Zolkin </PERSON>'s dedication to his bears is typical of the members of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Circus, considered on a par with the finest theater, opera and ballet in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` It's not your typical American circus; it's an art form,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leber </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Circus. `` These people have dedicated their entire lives to it.'' <PERSON> Leber </PERSON> traveled to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to choose 11 of the best circus acts from the hundreds of performers associated with the state-run circus, a revered institution in the country. The first professional circus school was established in the late 1920s. Students are trained for four years in different fields and also create their own acts. Once their act has been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Circus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, students graduate to professional careers and are guaranteed 20 years employment plus a full pension upon retirement. The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Circus last performed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1978 and just began a 15-city tour that will wind up at the Cow Palace in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Jan. 1. `` These are the superstars of the circus in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the real headliners,'' said <PERSON> Leber </PERSON>. Included in the circus are the bears, <LOCATION> Sumatran </LOCATION> tigers, clowns, jugglers, aerialists, trapeze artists and horsemen. One of the most spectacular acts is called `` The Flying Cranes,'' which consists of 10 aerial artists who combine a quadruple somersault and other daring acts with the choreography of a ballet as their movements tell their story of the soldiers who died in World War II, their souls becoming like those of `` cranes.'' `` When I appear in the arena, I immediately forget about everything else,'' said <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Golovko </PERSON>, 24, who with her husband, <PERSON> Vilen </PERSON>, is a star of `` The Flying Cranes.'' `` Our life is in the circus where we work. But one can not say that it is ... that it is just work. It is our way of life. Because all of our thoughts are with our work.'' The `` Cranes'' had its premiere in 1985, and creator <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> <PERSON> Maestrenka </PERSON> said it will be performed `` until we are absolutely sure there will be peace.'' Another notable performer and trainer is <PERSON> Tamerlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nugzarov </PERSON>, who oversees the 12 horses and horsemen who perform breathtaking stunts. Nugzarov, a short, powerfully-built man with a fierce demeanor, is from a circus family. He comes from the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> mountain range in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> where both men and the horses they ride are known to be fearless. Nugzarov and the other Cossack riders need courage. At times, all 12 horses gallop at full speed in the ring. Sometimes the riders are on the top of the horses, at other times they are beneath them. Sometimes they are beside them, with their arms and torsos dragged on the ground, both men and horses jumping through hoops surrounded by knives. `` A lot of the tricks have a method to it,'' said <PERSON> Nugzarov </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter a few hours before the show. `` There is this myth and legend to everything we do.'' The act is dangerous but <PERSON> Nugzarov </PERSON> said there have been few injuries. `` They have not been major,'' he said. `` After all, the hardest injuries are those to the soul.'' Equally daunting to watch is <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlenko </PERSON> as he steps into the cage with his 17 wild Sumatran tigers and coaxes them into performing without ever using a whip. `` My attitude about my work is dictated by my attitude toward them,'' he said. `` Animals should be allowed to show their character. They should not be oppressed nor made to think like we think.''

<HEAD>USDA Crop Reports Still Going Strong After 125 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This summer's searing heat and drought marked in cruel fashion the 125th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s first crop report on July 10, 1863. At the time, the Civil War was in full swing, with only a few days elapsed since the North and South bled each other on the fields of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>. And the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> itself was a fledgling department, created by President <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> just the year before. <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewell </PERSON>, secretary of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the latest successor to the long-ago bureaucracy that issued the first report, said the war put a damper on the collection of crop and livestock information. Even so, he said in an interview, the first report was nine pages and included a lengthy explanation of the need for such material and the meaning of the tables. `` We had the report reprinted this year, and as far as I can tell it's in the same format that was used then,'' <PERSON> Jewell </PERSON> said. `` Some of the information may be a little hard to understand by today's standards.'' For example, the original report did not include production figures for any crop. The board's report issued on Aug. 11, 1988, showed the corn crop at 4.48 billion bushels, down 37 percent from the 1987 harvest. Soybeans, which were not reported in 1863, were estimated at 1.47 billion bushels, down 23 percent from last year. Under the 1863 plan, monthly `` circulars'' were sent to about 2,000 farmer correspondents who voluntarily supplied <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> with the requested information. It was decided that the government should pay for the return postage. `` In the subjoined tables it will be seen that the questions relate to but two matters, the amount sown in 1863 compared with that in 1862, and the appearance of the crop in May and June,'' the report said. Replies from some of the states were not as numerous as desired, the report said. But the answers from `` the great grain-producing states of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, were full and satisfactory.'' The report added: `` It is due, too, that the promptness of the new and distant states of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> should be kindly acknowledged, and their example commended to states much nearer to the capital.'' Among the specific items, the 1863 report noted that the winter wheat crop in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Territory `` was destroyed by the winter, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> much injured from the same cause.'' Otherwise, the winter wheat crop looked pretty good in the 20 states, plus <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, that were surveyed. In 1863, there was also a familiar ring for today's corn farmers: `` This, our national crop, is reported as generally small in size on account of the drought of the latter part of May and the first half of June in some states, and nearly the whole of it in others.'' Although the Civil War caused little note in the 1863 crop report _ except by the absence of information from the Confederacy _ a portion devoted to wool took the secession into account. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sheep flock by the census of 1860 totaled more than 24.8 million head -LRB- compared with 10.8 million head on Jan. 1, 1988 -RRB- and wool production more than 60.5 million pounds. `` The rebel states produced 5,717,587 -LRB- sheep -RRB- of the whole number, which must be deducted from it, as they are not now represented in the wool market,'' the report said. `` <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> raised in 1862, 2,039,601 sheep, and the ravages of war have destroyed largely these.'' After some refiguring and allowing for projected annual increases, the report concluded that the North may have had a sheep flock of more than 26 million head and a wool clip of 79.4 million pounds in 1863. Today, the whole realm of crop and livestock statistics is handled by the department's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> NASS </ORGANIZATION>, headed by administrator <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON>. The agency issues more than 300 national reports and 9,000 state reports each year, covering more than 150 crop and livestock items. And in times of emergency, as with this year's drought, extra efforts are made. Normally, reponses from about 30,000 farmers provide much of the information for the monthly crop reports. Field surveys and other information are collected by the agency's 44 field offices. The information is sent to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for review by specialists, who then release final estimates through the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> under strict security conditions. In preparation for the vital Aug. 10 report, <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON> said, a special additional survey was conducted among 16,000 farmers in 28 states to help assess the drought damage. Also, he said, about 1,000 corn and soybean fields are inspected to help determine acreage and yield estimates. This year, the sample was doubled. But agency officials say one thing has n't changed from 1863: to protect farmers and consumers from speculators. As the 125-year-old report put it: `` Ignorance of the state of our crops invariably leads to speculation, in which oftentimes, the farmer does not obtain just prices, and by which the consumer is not benefited.''

 It does n't seem quite right to use the word huge when talking about a minivan, but that's the impression the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LE </ORGANIZATION> conveys. It also is comfortable, easy to drive and versatile. Want to take that antique table -LRB- with two leaves and four chairs -RRB- off <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>'s hands? Pull out the two back seats of the van and tuck the dining set inside for the trip home. No problem. And the furniture wo n't get wet or dirty, as it would in the back of a pickup during inclement weather. Have five young ballplayers to take to the park? Put the rear seats back in and there's room for equipment and another adult _ and no one is cramped. It's no wonder <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has sold more than 1 million of these little-big gems since the automaker pioneered the minivan concept in the 1984 model year. Today, bigger automakers such as <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> have joined the market, but <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> retains the sales lead. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s van is sold in smaller quantities and has a higher base price for the cheapest passenger model -LRB- about $ 13,200 vs. about $ 11,000 for a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> downsized vans are rear-drive and a bit larger than <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s. One auto analyst has called the minivan the product success of this decade, and some analysts predict annual industry sales of 1 million in the next decade. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s idea for the minivan was to provide a fuel-thrifty way to cart around passengers and cargo comfortably in a roomy vehicle that would drive like a car and fit in a garage like a car. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has stayed true to that concept, as the test <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LE </ORGANIZATION> bore out. It was easy to drive and felt like a car, even during difficult parallel parking maneuvers. Driving in some other, especially full-size, vans can give a distinct bus-like feel as you turn the steering wheel and maneuver. Getting in and out of the Voyager was uncomplicated compared with some other vans where you have to climb up to enter and take a flying leap to exit. But like other vans and unlike a car, the Voyager _ 64.4 inches tall _ offered a good view of the road ahead. I appreciated being able to spot potential slowdowns in traffic and parking spots in shopping center aisles. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakobowski </PERSON> noted company research shows the low step height and low loading height are among the main reasons for the minivans' popularity. Women like that, he said, adding that 37 percent of buyers are female. Buyers' median age is 39, with median annual income of $ 45,000, he said. Fifty-six percent are college graduates and as many as 45 percent have professional-technical-managerial jobs. The Voyager test vehicle had superb fit and finish, inside and out. The side door slid open easily for passenger exit. The rear seats were arranged so two people could sit comfortably in the middle seat and three adults could fit in the seat behind them. Both seats could be removed with a bit of effort after detaching locks that held the seats to hooks in the floor. Be sure to check that the locks hold when replacing the seats or, whoa, you might flip backwards. Bucket seats were in the front, with space between them so a person could climb into the back without going outside. But the van's roofline is low, so adults do have to hunch over when moving about inside. There was some room behind the rear seat for cargo storage, enough to stand up several grocery bags. If more room is needed, there's a lever to pull so the the rear seat advances on a track. The seat back also can be folded down. In the 1987 model year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also introduced a longer minivan, the Grand Voyager, which is 14 inches longer than the regular Voyager and offers more cargo space behind the rear seat. Both the regular and elongated vans have a lifting rear door so you do n't have to hoist items up and over the vehicle body. I also appreciated the rear window being all one piece. In some other vans, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astro </ORGANIZATION>, there is a pillar in the center which reduces rear viewing. Also changed from the earliest <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> minivan models are the engine options. The base engine for a Voyager has gone from a 2.2-liter four-cylinder powerplant to a 2.5-liter four-cylinder. Also offered is an optional 3-liter V-6, which boosts performance but decreases fuel economy. The test model had the V-6 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission. The V-6 certainly is an improvement over the standard four-cylinder, but I had to put in 15.3 gallons of gasoline after 263 combined city-highway miles. That worked out to around 17-18 miles per gallon. There were nice touches throughout. Because the engine and components take up much of the small hood and under-the-dash space, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> tucked the drawer-ike, locking glovebox under the passenger-side bucket seat. There was a center console on the ceiling that included map lights for driver and front-seat passenger, sunglasses storage and a spot for garage door transmitter. In the rear, there were two compartments for storing small items and spots to rest two cups. Outdoor enthusiasts who tow boats, campers, etc. will note that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s front-drive configuration does limit towing capacity, however. With the standard 2.5-liter four-cylinder, the Voyager can handle up to 2,000 lbs. with the V-6 and Class II frame-mounted trailer hitch, it can take 2,750 lbs. In contrast, many rear-drive vans can handle bigger loads. Consumer Reports says 1984-86 <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voyagers </ORGANIZATION> have ranked average or above average in reports of trouble.

 On one side of the chain link fence, children play kickball on the broken pavement, flanked by the yellow brick buildings that have been called the worst public housing project in the nation. On the other side, protected by armed security guards, rises a social experiment _ with roots both utopian and capitalist _ where poor residents and affluent young professionals will live in luxury apartments and share a swimming pool, tennis courts, a health club and a day-care center. The scene is the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> housing project on <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, a 51-acre site that marks the first attempt to convert a federal housing complex into private, for-profit housing The transformation is not occurring without pain or upheaval, however. Tenants of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> charge the private developer with harassment, unfair evictions and reduction in some services. The developer says the opportunity for decent housing depends on enforcing rules. To some housing experts, the rebirth of the complex as a landscaped development called `` Harbor Point'' is viewed as a test case that, if successful, could be applied to a generation of failed projects. `` There are thousands upon thousands of units in partially occupied public housing across the country that something has to be done with,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stegman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and Regional Planning at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>. The conversion at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> will result in far fewer low-income apartments than in the original project, but the payoff, he said, `` is restoring a community to livability.'' <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> rose out of an isolated city dump in 1953. In time, violence and drug dealing scarred the complex. Squatters occupied many vacant apartments and terrorized longtime residents. `` It was in a complete shambles,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittlesey </PERSON>, court-appointed overseer at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> in the 1970s. He and <PERSON> Stegman </PERSON> said that by that time, the project was notorious across the country. By 1984, the original population of 1,504 families was down to 350. That year, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> leased the property to the development firm <ORGANIZATION> Corcoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jennison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for 99 years for $ 1. For those 99 years, 400 of the 1,283 apartments at <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> must be reserved for low-income tenants who will pay no more than 30 percent of their gross household income in rent. The difference between that and market rent will be subsidized by the federal government. <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> produced a plan to create a complex of 20 multi-family buildings _ 10 rehabilitated <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> structures, 10 new ones _ and 214 new townhouses. Seventeen <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> point buildings were demolished. There are 1,283 units, 400 subsidized and 883 market-rate. Most of the apartments reserved for low-income residents will go to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> tenants, who are mainly black or Hispanic. Harbor Point enjoyed the backing of political leaders ranging from Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and received hefty state construction loans and federal tax breaks. <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> hopes to net $ 7.7 million per year in profit. To succeed, the firm says it has to play hardball with drug dealers, squatters, teen-agers who get into fights and anyone else at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> who might make life difficult at <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. But many of the 320 families from the project who will make the move to <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> say <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> is playing too hard. They have staged protests and even gone to court over what they call heavy-handed tactics and aggressive security guards. Tenants accuse <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> of trying to push out poor black families to replace them with poor whites and increase the marketability of the apartments. An evicted tenant is subject to arrest if he or she returns, even for a visit. `` This place was not geared for the black people in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolly </PERSON>, occupant of a tiny apartment in the complex for 16 years. `` It's not going to work the way they say it's going to work.'' <PERSON> Jolly </PERSON>'s daughter was among several tenants evicted from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> under the new management. Security guards falsely accused her of dealing drugs, Mrs. <PERSON> Jolly </PERSON> said, acknowledging only that her daughter was a drug user. `` My own daughter. She ca n't even come and visit her children. They'll pick her up for trespassing,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Jolly </PERSON> said. She is among several tenants who say they have been offered $ 1,000 to $ 4,000 by Harbor Point management to relocate and give up their guaranteed Harbor Point housing. The money is from a federal relocation fund. <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>'s marketing manager, denied anyone is being pressured or bribed into leaving <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, and she insisted the developer wants a racially and economically mixed complex. This summer the first market-rate tenants began moving into <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, drawn by advertisements emphasizing its views of downtown <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and touting its luxury amenities. Market-rate rents are $ 675 and $ 1,200 per month. Will Harbor Point succeed in mingling <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s poorest minority residents with well-off, mostly white tenants? `` Where this thing will rise and fall is on the human side,'' said <PERSON> Stegman </PERSON>. He is optimistic, because of the development's choice location and because <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> `` really cares about the true nature of the partnership'' between <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> residents and market-rate tenants. `` It's not just a case of throwing them all in and hoping it works,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Corcoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jennison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, who noted a tenants task force helps make decisions. Task force executive director <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> for 20 years, acknowledged that some security guards `` use their authority forcefully.'' But the guards work in a place where, for years, there have been no rules, he said. In answer to charges that the guards, most of whom are white, have uttered racial slurs at tenants, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who is black, said teen-agers in the project routinely harass the guards. The stated goal of <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> is to mix its varied tenants together, but the developer acknowledged some isolation will occur. That's because families with children are not allowed, for safety reasons, to live in the five - to seven-story mid-rise buildings that will have 903 apartments In the mid-rises, <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> said, market-rate tenants will outnumber low-income tenants about 4-to-1, because most of the low-income tenants are families with children. Besides the mid-rises, most of which are new, and the 214 townhouses, there will be 166 `` garden flats'' in low-rise rehabilitated <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> Point buildings. Despite the problems, Ms. <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>: `` People are looking at us as a model. We're under a microscope. We feel confident that we have the experience.''

Prosecutors charged <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> with using his position at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> to steal market-sensitive information about pending takeovers and other confidential matters in which the firm played a role. The government alleged <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> peddled the information starting in June 1987 to a Taiwanese businessman, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who allegedly used it to make at least $ 19 million in profitable stock trades in more than 14 companies and shared about $ 200,000 with <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was named as an unindicted co-conspirator, but <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> declined to explain why <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was not charged. Federal officials said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, also known by his Chinese name <PERSON> Chwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has frozen the U.S.-based assets of both men and requested return of the $ 19 million plus triple penalties for a total of $ 76 million. That amount makes the case the second-biggest insider trading scheme next to the record $ 100 million in illicit profits and penalties surrendered by now-imprisoned Wall Street speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> nearly two years ago. The <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> case is considered significant not only because of the amount of money involved, but because the alleged abuses came at the height of a public uproar over Wall Street greed and corruption highlighted by the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> scandal. It suggested that insider trading remains a deep-rooted problem. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> cooperated in the government's investigation and faces no criminal liability, but also indicated the firm should have done more to detect <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s activities, which the former analyst allegedly undertook during much of his internship <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> did not return telephone calls for comment on Wednesday. The firm fired <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> after the scandal first was disclosed and has stated it believed adequate precautions were taken. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, at the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> firm <ORGANIZATION> Buchanan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ingersoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PC </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that the criminal charges against <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> were news to him. He declined to comment on any aspect of the case or his client. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said the separate, previously undisclosed insider trading scheme involving <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> included an unidentified person living in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, where <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> grew up. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said the person was not a Wang relative or engaged in the financial business, but declined to elaborate. In that scheme, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> fed market-sensitive tips about developments in at least five companies to the other individual, who used the information to make profitable trades and rewarded <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> with about $ 4,000. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, who attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Champaign-Urbana </LOCATION>, won a coveted internship at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> before he graduated and was only days short of completing it when the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> brought its civil complaint.

 The principal defendants in the federal government's long-awaited, massive insider trading suit against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the head of its pioneering junk bond business say they welcome the fight as a chance for vindication. Ending months of speculation on Wall Street, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filed a 184-page civil complaint Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> accusing <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> of engaging in a secret arrangement with convicted speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> that included illegal insider trading, stock manipulation and fraud. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, reiterated the firm's longstanding claims that it would be absolved of the charges. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> also again denied any wrongdoing. Wednesday's lawsuit capped months of guessing about whether the government had built an extensive case against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> on evidence turned up by the nearly two-year-old <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading scandal. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> charges against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, with whom <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> worked extensively, widely had been expected since his illegal dealings were revealed in November 1986. `` For the past 22 months I have been the subject of a shadow trial of systematic leaks and innuendo based upon false accusations,'' <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. `` ... No one likes to be sued, but I welcome the opportunity to have at long last a full and open hearing of the allegations in an unbiased forum.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, who in July told <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees to expect charges against the firm, issued a statement saying: `` We disagree with the charges filed by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and in due course we expect to be vindicated.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said it would seek to have the defendants _ three companies and six individuals _ surrender profits made from illegal stock trades. The lawsuit also sought from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maultasch </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employee, civil penalties of three times those profits. The agency offered no specific amount, but Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> was seeking $ 100 million. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who is serving a three-year federal prison term on an insider-trading related charge, was forced to surrender a record $ 100 million in penalties and illegal trading profits. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> allegedly had an arrangement with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> involving at least 16 series of illegal securities transactions. Under that agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> claimed, Boesky-controlled companies secretly bought, sold or held securities for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> or individual defendants while <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> sometimes reciprocated with secret transactions for <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> employees kept secret, off-the-books records as part of the arrangement. And the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> claimed <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> traded in securities using confidential information misappropriated from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s own clients. In 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> allegedly made $ 1.23 million in profits using inside information on a pending merger between <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> and Telepictures and allegedly avoided $ 1.78 million in losses the following year after learning privileged information from <ORGANIZATION> Viacom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> about a leveraged buyout proposal. Federal law bars corporate executives, investment bankers and others with access to confidential corporate information from using it to trade in securities. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, whose office prosecuted <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and other Wall Street criminals, declined to comment on whether <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> or any of the other defendants faced criminal charges. There had been speculation the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> delayed filing its civil complaint to avoid interfering with a criminal probe. In addition to <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maultasch </PERSON>, a senior equity trader at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters, other defendants included <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Monzert </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, both <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s parent corporation, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, also is a defendant. Others defendants are <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, which also was named as a defendant, and <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, a director and vice chairman of the board at <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Engineering. A spokeswoman, <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mottram </PERSON>, said the Posners had not seen the complaint and could not comment.

 Former stockbroker <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> has pleaded guilty to another criminal charge stemming from his admissions that he traded securities based on advance knowledge of a stock market column that appears in Business Week magazine. `` I know what I did was wrong and I'm very sorry for what I did and for the people who were affected,'' <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, 34, told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> when he pleaded guilty Wednesday to a single count of wire fraud. <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, who had worked in <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> branch, was the first person to face criminal charges as a result of a federal probe into insider trading on Business Week's `` Inside Wall Street'' columns <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, who was fired by <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, already has pleaded guilty to a separate wire fraud charge in federal court in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, under an agreement with the government. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> stated that <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> has been cooperating in a continuing investigation of insider trading based on advance knowledge of securities to be mentioned in Business Week.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s mammoth civil suit against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> marks a major turning point in a federal crusade against Wall Street corruption and could devastate the scrappy investment firm that pioneered `` junk-bond'' takeover financing. But the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s move against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> also presents great risks to the government's case, by providing the firm with its first big opportunity to acquit itself of wrongdoing after months of damaging press leaks and innuendo, criminal lawyers say. The move also may reflect tension between the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office and <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigators, who have been assembling a dossier on <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> for months and were eager to proceed with it. They reportedly had been deferring action until federal prosecutors completed a parallel probe of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, a precursor to possible felony charges. But there have been signs that the criminal investigation is facing delays. Lawyers familiar with the procedure in such cases said it was highly unusual that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> took action before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, because <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> now has the opportunity to seek wide-ranging access to the government's evidence and cross-examine witnesses under civil pretrial discovery rules Had <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> faced criminal charges first, its access to the government's evidence and prospective witnesses would be sharply restricted and could cripple an effective defense. `` If I were one of the defendants in this civil case, I'd scramble like mad to start taking discovery,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldberg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> defense attorney and former federal prosecutor `` If you're a defendant in a criminal case, the thing you have the least of is information.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s 184-page civil complaint filed Wednesday against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and other defendants, notably <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, head of its controversial high-yield bond business, alleges a variety of systematic, fraudulent activity conducted largely in concert with now-imprisoned speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. The accusations range from insider trading to falsifying record books. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> did n't quantify <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s allegedly illicit profits. But the deals mentioned in its complaint involve some of the biggest corporate takeovers of the 1980s, in which <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> played a prominent financing role through its innovative use of high-risk, high-yield securities commonly called junk bonds. If the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> can prove <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> made tens of millions of dollars in illegal profits on those and other transactions, then the firm's potential exposure is enormous: the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is seeking return of that money plus triple the amount in damages Moreover, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> can seek court orders kicking <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> or other defendants out of the securities business, a potentially ruinous prospect for one of Wall Street's most successful firms. One of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> complaint's most intriguing elements is that it describes a relationship in which <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, once thought to be a masterful independent Wall Street financier, is little more than a corrupt agent for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. If true, this suggests the government's crackdown on securities fraud is focusing more on outwardly legitimate investment banking activities by big Wall Street firms and less on errant individuals. `` This is the final phase of what many people have been talking about for the last couple of years,'' Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, author of a proposed law to tighten penalties for insider trading and other securities fraud, said after the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> action was announced. `` <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> looked like the middleman.'' Nevertheless, the government faces a daunting task in proving the accusations against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which persistently has said it would fight to vindicate itself in court and has undertaken a massive public relations campaign in anticipation of a crisis. The biggest potential weakness in the government's case is <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who judging from the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> complaint would be a star witness. As a convicted felon, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s credibility could be shattered by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyers. `` The question is whether the trail of transactions is sufficient for the government to believe it has enough to corroborate <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Walpin </PERSON>, a former federal prosecutor now at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION> Rosenman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Colin. `` I'm certain both sides have attempted that analysis.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who faces insider trading charges, is seen as the Wall Street whiz kid who made `` junk-bond'' financing into the tool of choice for corporate raiders. In so doing, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, 42, transformed <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from a minor player on Wall Street into a powerhouse and in the process made himself feared, respected and enormously wealthy. The 184-page civil complaint filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> against <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and others on Wednesday followed months of speculation about <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading scandal. Although the move by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had been anticipated, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and others who have made fortunes in junk bonds continued to hold their annual <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> spring gathering known as the Predators' Ball. The message was clear: Never mind the burgeoning government investigation of insider trading. It was business as usual at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was still king of the junk bonds _ high-risk, high-yield notes used to finance corporate takeovers. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> had refused to comment publicly on the scandal up until Wednesday, when he issued a written statement asserting that `` for the past 22 months I have been the subject of a shadow trial of systematic leaks and innuendo based on false accusations.'' In anticipation of a crisis, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> undertook a public-relations campaign starting last year to polish its image, stressing the role of junk bonds in helping small companies and downplaying their role in large takeover battles. The normally secretive and unreachable <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> himself played a major role in that blitz, accepting speaking engagements. He granted selective media interviews _ on condition there would be no questions about the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the investigation. The speeches and interviews focused almost solely on <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s latest pet plan _ to alleviate the <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> debt crisis by swapping debt for equity or selling securities backed by those countries' oil and silver resources In the years before the insider trading scandal, the financial media wrote glowingly of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. `` A one-man revolution,'' Forbes magazine headlined one typical article. `` A world-class financial wizard, on a plane with the likes of <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> ... <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> of the money markets,'' wrote <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Business magazine. It had been a relatively short road for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, from head cheerleader at <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in 1964 _ actress <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON> and superagent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovitz </PERSON> were among his classmates _ to the top of the nation's financial industry. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> reportedly pulls down $ 40 million a year as the head of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s junk-bond operation and his personal fortune has been estimated at more than $ 500 million. He lives with his children and wife, <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> _ his high school sweetheart whom he married at age 22 _ in a house on the former estate of the late actor <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> in suburban <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION>, an upper-middle-class section of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> two miles from his childhood home. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s fascination with finance stetches back to his boyhood. At age 10, while other boys were giggling over comic books, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was enamored of money. A favorite pastime was hovering over tax returns being prepared by his father, an accountant. After studying business at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> went to work for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> as a junior bond trader. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> merged with <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1973 and <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brussels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 to become today's <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s job was moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> worked hard to make a name for himself but never got used to the East. As the story goes, he wearied of the cold Eastern winters that froze his water pipes and kept his two children from playing outside. He also tired of the long commutes from his home in suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to Wall Street. In 1977, he pulled off a coup by convincing <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to let him move the company's junk-bond operations from <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, just off swank Rodeo Drive. His reasoning was simple: He did n't have to be sitting in a tiny office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to make deals. He just had to know the players and have their confidence. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was enormously successful in that regard, almost single-handedly building a close-knit network of junk-bond investors. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> no longer has to go on the road to make deals. The corporate players come to him. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> still works hard _ 12 to 13 hours a day, seven days a week. He once said he had no hobbies `` because what I do is fun.'' <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s appearance generally is described as ordinary. He buys his suits off the rack, and it was only a couple years ago that he traded in his unstylish <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> car for a Mercedes.

 The proposed $ 2.5 billion merger of <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has been blocked temporarily by a federal judge as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s attorney general fought the plan he said would bring higher food prices to the state. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>, who issued a temporary restraining order Wednesday, said he believed the acquisition of Lucky supermarkets by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, parent of the <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION>'s supermarket chain, threatens `` serious irreversible harm'' to Californians <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> scheduled a hearing Sept. 16 on whether to grant a preliminary injunction sought by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>, who sued to prevent the merger, says that transaction coupled with the recent acquisition of Oakland-based <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> stores by El Monte-based <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> spells higher prices for consumers. He said a survey he commissioned indicated the two mergers would increase food prices by $ 400 million a year in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> has said the merger of Lucky with <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> would lower consumer food prices by $ 50 million annuallyu. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lillie </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement said: `` Judge <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>'s ruling was simply designed to maintain the status quo until a hearing on the merits of the case can be heard. We are confident that the court will not want to delay the combination of Alpha Beta and <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> once we have the chance to lay out the facts before him.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has tentatively approved the <ORGANIZATION> Lucky-Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> merger, although it would require American to sell 37 markets to competing chains to maintain competition. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> wants a trial to decide whether the marriage of two supermarket giants is anti-competitive. `` The proposed acquisition threatens serious irreversible harm to the public interest within <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which outweighs any harm to defendants if the mergers are temporarily restrained,'' <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> said in imposing the temporary restraining order. The judge forbade <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> from launching a joint operation with Lucky stores until the matter is resolved in court. The combination would give the <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta-Lucky </ORGANIZATION> chain 550 stores. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>, who has threatened similar court action in the Vons-Safeway merger, said talks are progressing on reaching an out-of-court settlement of that dispute.

<HEAD>Survey: Biotech Sales Rising, But Most Companies Still
Unprofitable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Biotechnology companies' product sales rose 25 percent last year, but three-quarters of the companies lost money, according to a survey by <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Fifty-eight percent of the companies had lower profits this year than last year, apparently because they were spending heavily for the future, while 74 percent lost money, according to the survey released Wednesday by the accounting and consulting firm The companies' research and development spending rose 32 percent, outpacing revenue growth, the survey said. Biotechnology companies are having a hard time raising money through stock offerings, especially since the stock market crash, and therefore are spending the cash accumulated through past financings in hopes of getting products to market and earning the respect of investors, the firm stated. `` They expect _ and need _ to impress Wall Street again,'' the firm said. `` The strategy is obviously risky.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> concluded that the biotechnology industry is beginning to fulfill its promise, although `` the road remains rough in some sectors.'' `` The general public was thinking in terms of writing the obituary to this industry,'' said <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrill </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION>'s high technology group. A survey that drew responses from executives at 291 companies found that on average they expected 32 percent of the companies to be acquired within five years and 46 percent to be acquired within 10 years. The executives' estimate may be too high, <PERSON> Burrill </PERSON> said. He said the biotech companies' close linkages with larger companies would limit their attractiveness to other big companies that might want to acquire them.

 If he ca n't teach them capitalism, at least he'll give them heartburn. The man who brought American pizza to the Soviets via a roving concession truck in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> now says he is working to establish the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first full-fledged pizza parlor. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Piancone </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Roma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Piscataway </LOCATION>, said Wednesday he plans to meet next week with Soviet officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and inspect several potential sites for a pizza restaurant in the capital and two other cities. `` We are going to be looking at several locations in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tula </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Piancone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Piancone </PERSON> and his partner, Ukranian-born entrepreneur <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeiger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moorestown </LOCATION>, entered a joint venture with Soviet officials last year to bring the company's <ORGANIZATION> Astro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> mobile concession truck to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The truck began selling slices of the American fast food to tourists and Soviet customers in April. `` Our sales so far have been extremely lucrative,'' he said. `` This is just the next logical step.'' To date the truck has been using ingredients purchased in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because Soviet tomatoes, cheese and other products were not readily available. <PERSON> Piancone </PERSON> said his trip will include a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials to discuss the feasibility of using products grown locally. The mobile pizza parlor made a splash in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> when it began operating on a snowy day in April, selling more than 1,200 slices of the cheese-and-tomato pie in just three hours. Since opening, <PERSON> Piancone </PERSON> said the truck has operated three days a week for tourists, accepting only Western currency, and three days a week for local customers, selling slices for 1.25 rubles, roughly just more than $ 2 a slice. The truck does not make rounds on the seventh day. <PERSON> Piancone </PERSON> said it was always his intention, and the intention of his Soviet partners _ who by law own 51 percent of the enterprise _ to open permanent restaurants around the country. He said the company is concerned that competitors may take the initiative away if <ORGANIZATION> Astro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> does n't move quickly. <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and Pizza Hut Restaurants earlier this year announced their intention to open two restaurants in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Piancone </PERSON> said neither has opened yet. But he said a <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> ice cream parlor opened in the lobby of a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> hotel. The ice cream parlor does not accept Soviet currency, which is not readily convertible on currency markets. `` I think the people in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> kind of resent that approach,'' <PERSON> Piancone </PERSON> said.

 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today criticized regulators' use of promissory notes to rescue insolvent savings institutions as a `` shell game'' designed to push the problem into the next administration. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the nation's 3,000 savings institutions, has pledged more than $ 12 billion over the last three weeks to rescue or close 48 savings institutions, including 21 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and 14 in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, states hard hit by the depression in the oil industry However, much of the assistance has been in the form of interest-bearing notes, which will obligate the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to billions of dollars in payments a year for the next decade. The plan `` seems to be nothing more than a massive shell game in which insolvent institutions are reshuffled, the names changed, and little if any real capital injected, resulting in thinly capitalized weak institutions,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` Many of these institutions will ultimately have to be bailed out again at even greater cost to the taxpayer,'' he said. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said the bank board's strategy would `` postpone the day on which the bill for this crisis becomes due until long after the members of the current administration have left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and are sitting on a beach somewhere.'' However, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, who is asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to put the full faith and credit of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government behind the notes, said the notes, because they are tax free and carry a low interest rate, are the most effective way to close down insolvent thrift institutions that are draining the industry's health Wall said his agency had $ 10.1 billion in the notes outstanding at the end of August and said by the end of this month it will have spent billions more to resolve the cases of 65 more ailing thrifts. Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the committee, was particularly critical of the $ 2 billion rescue earlier this week of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> <PERSON> Group </PERSON>, the investment arm of a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, billionaire, is spending $ 550 million and getting $ 2 billion in assistance from <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> to acquire American. It is the largest-ever rescue of a single savings institution. Part of the deal allows Bass to use $ 1.5 billion of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s funds for merchant banking activities such as acquisitions of commercial companies `` Frankly, I am concerned when notes ... are utilized to promote risky ventures such as merchant bank subsidiaries,'' <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> said, warning thatr, `` the industry as a whole can be expected to take this as a green light to again reach for the riskier operations.'' The Bass group has been an active player in corporate takeover battles in recent years. It is currently pushing a $ 1.75 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a publishing company. Previously, it has participated in buyouts of <ORGANIZATION> Taft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Howell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Wall, in a letter earlier this week to Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., who also had questioned the merchant banking activities, said they are being permitted to allow the Bass group to `` capture substantial tax benefits'' of taking over the ailing S & amp; L. He noted that 75 percent of the benefits will be funneled back to the government fund insuring S & amp; L Moreover, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said, the agreement with <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> `` will impose substantial restrictions, more stringent than those imposed by -LRB- <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> -RRB- state law.'' Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fear that the slew of <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> notes issued in recent weeks setting up the insurance fund for a bailout by taxpayers, with some private analysts pegging the cost of restoring the industry's health as high as $ 80 billion. However, the bank board says it expects to receive $ 42 billion in income over the next decade and to spend only $ 31 billion. The bank board is also being criticized for agreeing to negotiate exclusively with Bass since April 21. Before that, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had pursued the acquisition of American for 10 months. Its executives were upset about being shut out from making another offer for most of this year.

 Futures prices for grain and soybeans opened moderately lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting an increase in farmers' sales of new-crop soybeans at levels near $ 9 a bushel, analysts said. Soybeans for November delivery advanced to $ 9.05 a bushel Wednesday before closing at $ 8.97. Many farmers who sign forward contracts to sell their new-crop soybeans to grain elevators found such levels hard to resist, said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, an assistant vice president of grain futures trading with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Farmers have n't seen $ 9 beans for quite a while,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Leow </PERSON> said soybeans historically have rarely maintained the $ 9 level, and she predicted prices would fluctuate within an $ 8-to - $ 9 range until significant new export demand develops The corn and soybean harvests are getting underway, which typically has a negative impact on prices, she said. Some wheat futures rallied Wednesday to match the year's highs reached earlier this summer but the market could not break through those levels. In early trading today, wheat was 2 cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.23 a bushel; corn was 3 cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with September at $ 2.88 -LCB- a bushel; December oats, the only oat contract active in early trading, was 2 -LCB- cents lower at $ 2.77 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 8 -LCB- cents lower with September at $ 8.77 a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .10 cent to .50 cent lower with October at 71.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .55 cent lower with September at 81.10 cents a pound; hogs were .32 cent lower to .10 cent higher with October at 38.10 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .27 cent to .75 cent lower with February at 47.35 cents a pound.

UP & amp; L and <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> have promised to lower rates by 5 percent to 10 percent within five years if the merger is approved <PERSON> Cumming </PERSON>'s bid, which would be subject to approval by state regulators, is his second offer for <ORGANIZATION> UP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L. `` About a year and a half ago, Mr. <PERSON> Cumming </PERSON> hired <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to do a price check on what <ORGANIZATION> UP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L stock was worth,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> quoted one source as saying. `` Mr. <PERSON> Cumming </PERSON> increased the price and made the offer to UP & amp; L, but the offer was rejected.''

 Republican members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> made clear today that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to build bipartisan support for legislation imposing new and stern economic sanctions against white-dominated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. And <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials suggested that any action on the measure to institute an almost-total trade embargo on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and to pull out most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment might disrupt delicate ongoing negotiations involving independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and the withdrawal of cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The committee set a vote for Wednesday on the measure as statements from individual <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members indicated the legislation will not enjoy the wide bipartisan support given the milder sanctions bill that became law over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto two years ago. Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., a key supporter of sanctions legislation in 1986, called the present bill `` untimely'' and told the committee, `` There are occasions when legislation is not always helpful. `` At this moment, to go into a total disruption of our business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> does not benefit anyone,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said, adding that the measure would remove any leverage the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has to bring pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to end its apartheid system of forced racial separation. Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan., agreed, saying she does not believe that comprehensive sanctions will end apartheid `` We simply create havoc,'' she said. `` To strike out alone with a package that requires complete disinvestment and a total trade embargo does not behoove us at this time.'' Speaking for the bill, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said it is designed to `` increase the costs of maintaining apartheid. `` If we fail to focus on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> we will, in essence, allow the South African regime to declare victory ...,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. `` We have a moral obligation to continue to press for freedom for all South Africans.'' Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, is reportedly ready to submit up to 40 amendments designed to dilute the impact of the legislation during its examination by the Foreign Relations panel. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is considered highly likely to veto new sanctions legislation if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> follows the lead of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and approves a bill blocking most trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and requiring practically a complete withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business investment. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., another backer of the harsh sanctions measure, said on Wednesday they believed the measure could be brought to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor for a vote in the waning days of this year's session, despite a tight legislative schedule But both said it would be difficult to pass the bill in the absence of significant Republican support. They said opponents could make it difficult even to get it past the Foreign Relations Committee. Even if both of those hurdles were cleared, there would not be enough support to override a veto, they said. But any action, even passage by the committee, would `` send a signal to the government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that pressure is rising'' against apartheid, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` I know of no other way to send that signal, other than sanctions,'' he said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said his recent five-day trip to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> convinced him that it is time for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to adopt the most punishing economic sanctions to date as a signal to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> that its apartheid policies of racial repression must be abandoned. `` Blacks are living in despair and hopelessness, and whites are living in fear,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told a news conference. `` And the greater the fear, the more there is repression.'' `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is drifting toward massive violence and the community of nations has to signal to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that peaceful change has got to come about,'' he said. The House bill, passed on Aug. 11 by a vote of 244-132, has become a focal point of election-year politics. Many Democrats would like to force the issue in order to portray Republicans who oppose it as weak on civil and human rights. Opponents contend stronger sanctions would impose further economic hardship on black South Africans and strengthen the government's resolve to resist pressure for change from outside. A more limited sanctions measure was enacted two years ago over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, an action made possible only with significant <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> support in both chambers.

<HEAD>Postal Service Contract Subject Of Appeals Court Arguments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorneys for billionaire <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> have told a federal appeals court that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> never intended postal contracts to be subject to government competitive bidding rules. But <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>'s former company, which is challenging the attempt by <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to do business together, disputed the claim in arguments Wednesday before a three-judge federal panel reviewing the case. <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> sold to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, is challenging a contract between the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> and his new company, <ORGANIZATION> Perot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Perot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> won the contract without competitive bids or notice to other companies that such a venture was envisioned The contract involves <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> studying the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and recommending efficiency steps and then sharing the savings realized from his ideas. It is <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>'s first attempt to compete directly with his former company. `` This is an area where <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has spoken often about the need for competition,'' EDS attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schecter </PERSON> told the judges. EDS initially lodged a protest with the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, and contended that the potentially lucrative contract awarded to <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> conflicted with bidding rules. The appeals board voided the contract in August. The federal appeals court could reinstate the contract. Two federal statutes were at the center of the arguments Wednesday. One requires most government agencies to solicit competitive bids on purchases involving computers and data processing, and another created the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 as a quasi-private agency. In creating the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> freed it from federal rules and regulations unless specified by law. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> does not have jurisdiction over the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and therefore lacks the authority to invalidate the <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> contract. <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Elgarten </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Perot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' intent in creating the service was `` to free the Postal Service from the constraints'' binding its predecessor

<HEAD>Lawmaker Files Bribery Complaint Against Company Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A member of the Japanese parliament filed a complaint Thursday against three businessmen for allegedly offering him a 5 million yen bribe to end his investigation of an insider trading case, officials said. <PERSON> Yanosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON>, of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, filed the complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecutor </ORGANIZATION>'s Office against the current and past officials of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Rescuit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate firm at the center of an insider-trading scandal, a spokeswoman for the lawmaker said. According to <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON>, one of the men, <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsubara </PERSON>, then a top aide to Recruit's president, brought him the equivalent of $ 37,000 in cash on Aug. 4, one day before the lawmaker was to take part in the questioning of government officials about the insider trading scandal. <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON> said he declined the money. Recruit officials have maintained that <PERSON> Matsubara </PERSON> was acting independently, but the lawmaker told reporters Thursday he believed the alleged bribery attempt was carried out on behalf of Recruit. <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON> claims a contact number left by <PERSON> Matsubara </PERSON> was that of the company, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. The two other officials named in the complaint were former <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> and Recruit-Cosmos President <PERSON> Tomoyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON>, the lawmaker's secretary <PERSON> Aya </PERSON> <PERSON> Narazaki </PERSON> said. In a statement, Recruit said it was unaware of the contents of the complaint, but would `` cope with the situation with a cautious and sincere attitude.'' Company officials declined to discuss the case further. The insider trading scandal surfaced in July when it was revealed that aides to top politicians bought <ORGANIZATION> Rescruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> stock in 1984 at bargain prices before it was put on the market, and then made hefty profits when prices soared after the stocks were officially traded. Those who profited reportedly included aides to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> and other top figures in the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, as well as senior business and news media figures.

 The stock market advanced slightly today, seemingly unfazed by Wall Street's latest insider trading case. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.62 to 2,070.41 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers edged ahead of losers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 684 up, 671 down and 532 unchanged. Analysts said no concerted selling appeared in the wake of the news late Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had charged <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and several other parties with a series of securities violations. For one thing, they said, it had long been known and widely discussed on Wall Street that the investigation leading to the allegations was under way. However, brokers added, it was evident that the market was still suffering from apathy and caution about the outlook for the economy and interest rates. Some observers have said it was disappointing that the market showed little follow-through this week to its pre-Labor Day rally, which was touched off by evidence that economic growth was moderating. <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> jumped 2 to 9 | on word of a $ 10-a-share bid for the company by a concern controlled by the <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> rose | to 27 -LRB-.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s external trade commissioner warned <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Thursday to help reduce trade imbalances as the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> becomes a more important market for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, in a speech delivered to a journalists' conference in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and distributed in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, said the unified European market may have to adopt rules to protect some industries from excessive imports However, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> brushed aside fears that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> would become more protectionist as it moves to set up a single internal market by 1992 as `` totally unjustified.'' The trade commissioner predicted that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surplus with the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> will increase in the second half of 1988, even though it slipped during the first half of the year. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, who makes such warnings to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on a regular basis, repeated calls for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to increase imports and to give the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> greater access to its markets. He said the issue was becoming more important as the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> becomes a more important trading partner for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is now the big, profitable, open market for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he said. He noted that the creation of a single market will create unified EEC rules on trade and this will benefit foreign companies resident in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. He warned at the same time that restrictions at the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> level may be set up in certain `` sensitive sectors'' to replace various national restrictions which currently exist to protect some industries. `` Such community measures would, of course, be discussed with our trading partners and would have to conform fully with our international obligations,'' he said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the 12-nation trade bloc rose in July to 258 billion yen, up 14 percent from the year-earlier period, according to figures distributed Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Calculated in dollars, the surplus rose in July by 28.5 percent to $ 1.9 billion, but fell 3.2 percent in the first seven months of 1988 compared with the year-earlier period. The statistics showed Japanese imports from the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> rose 16.2 percent in yen terms and by 30.7 percent in dollar terms in the month of July. Non-ferrous metals, aircraft and textiles showed the sharpest growth. Meanwhile, Japanese exports to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> rose 15.1 percent in yen terms and 29.6 percent in dollar terms due primarily to increases in exports of automobiles, office machinery and audio-visual equipment.

<TEXT>
 A theme underlying the government's unprecedented civil enforcement action against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is that the investment firm used convicted insider trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> as a stooge for cheating and illegal profiteering But some securities lawyers find that idea flawed. More likely, they say, is that <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> had a mutually beneficial relationship, assuming the accusations leveled by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> are accurate. `` Frankly, I'm very skeptical that <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> was the manipulator behind the scenes of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a partner in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Orrick </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herrington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s trading practices committee. `` It's true in the securities market generally that people work together in all kinds of ways. Transactions are seldom isolated to one participant,'' he said. `` So it's possible that <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> could be an agent technically for some purpose in dealing with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, but I'd say the converse is equally likely. That fact does n't lead me to conclude <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> was a puppeteer in this role.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s mammoth enforcement action, undertaken Wednesday after an investigation that lasted ne Other controversial House amendments would: deny student loans and other federal benefits to convicted drug users, admit illegally seized evidence in court if police acted in `` good faith'' during a search, and withhold federal highway money from states that refuse to revoke or suspend drivers' licenses of convicted drug users. As the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conducted a generally mild-mannered debate on the 375-page bill Wednesday, policemen-turned-lobbyists roamed through lawmakers' offices to present their views on a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchasers. They were not all on the same side in debating this provision of the drug bill, which includes an optional background check on the purchaser during the week-long delay. Rank-and-file officers supporting the waiting period are part of a coalition of law enforcement organizations and gun control groups. The coalition has set up shop in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> basement hearing room in the Rayburn Office Building across the street from the Capitol. Other policemen are lobbying for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes the waiting period and virtually any form of gun control that affects the general population. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., will try to eliminate the waiting period His amendment would substitute an identification system that would allow gun dealers to check by telephone or other means to determine whether a purchaser is a convicted felon. The <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON> proposal on the death penalty would permit _ but not require _ a judge to impose the death sentence on anyone convicted of intentionally killing someone during a drug felony. If the death penalty was not imposed, the amendment would require a sentence of 20 years to life. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation that passed last June would permit the death penalty for narcotics dealers convicted of murder in drug crimes; and for drug `` kingpins,'' defined under law as those who supervise five or more people, commit at least three federal drug felonies and derive substantial income from a continuing criminal enterprise. The only brief moment of emotion during the opening debate Wednesday came when Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, urged the House not to `` stoop as low as those killers in the street'' by approving the death penalty. He said it would be `` beneath the dignity of this House'' to approve the Gekas language. But <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON> rose to <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON>' defense, calling the death penalty `` the missing deterrence'' in the fight against illegal drugs. Most federal death penalty provisions are not enforceable because, unlike some state laws, they were never brought into compliance with <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> guidelines on capital punishment. The overall anti-drug bill provides for money and programs that would attack drug use from every conceivable direction. The legislation would increase spending for federal and state law enforcement agencies to intercept illegal drugs on land, in the air and on the seas. Banking laws would be changed to try to stop the laundering of drug money at legitimate financial institutions. Education programs would be expanded for youth, including disadvantaged youngsters and the most hardened gang members. Capacity would be increased, and waiting periods lessened, for entry into drug rehabilitation programs. The bill encourages Latin American countries to form a regional anti-narcotics force and pledges financial support if one is started. Federal contractors would be required to maintain a drug-free workplace. Tight controls would be placed on the U.S.-made chemicals that are used to manufacture heroin, cocaine and other drugs. States also would be given money to develop programs to stop the spread of AIDS by intravenous drug abusers.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will spend $ 1 billion over the next five years to expand its extended-stay lodging centers, company officials announced Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> plans to build 300 Residence Inns nationwide, with most of the units scheduled for construction in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, and West. <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> already has 123 Residence Inns, which feature moderately-priced, all-suite accommodations geared to customers staying in hotels for five or more nights at a time.

Extended-stay travelers now account for more than 50 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Residence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION> division's business, which <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> officials estimate to be more than 7 million customers per year, who average 10 nights or longer per stay. Residence Inns are built in a two-story residential style and include either one or two-bedroom suites. Each comes with complete kitchens, and many include fireplaces. Swimming pools, health spas and exercise clubs are also available to lodgers.

Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 671 up, 689 down and 562 unchanged. Analysts said no concerted selling appeared in the wake of the news late Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had charged <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and several other parties with a series of securities violations. For one thing, they said, it had long been known and widely discussed on Wall Street that the investigation leading to the allegations was under way. However, brokers added, it was evident that the market was still suffering from apathy and caution about the outlook for the economy and interest rates. Some observers have said it was disappointing that the market showed little follow-through this week to its pre-Labor Day rally, which was touched off by evidence that economic growth was moderating. <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> jumped 2 to 9 | on word of a $ 10-a-share bid for the company by a concern controlled by the <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> rose -LCB- to 27. On Wednesday the company named <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruckelshaus </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, as its chairman and chief executive. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks lost .07 to 150.31.

 Soybean futures closed strongly higher Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to new drought-damage estimates while wheat declined and corn was narrowly mixed. The crop production estimates of about 30 trading companies averaged 1.4 billion bushels of soybeans and 4.2 billion bushels of corn. Those compare with last year's production of 1.9 billion bushels of soybeans and 7.1 billion bushels of corn. The average estimated production declines of 25 percent for soybeans and 41 percent for corn compare with the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s August estimates of a 23 percent reduction in the soybean crop and a 37 percent drop in corn production. Strength in the soybean meal market added to the soybean rally, said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Balletto </PERSON>, soybean analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat declined in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of various offers for export sales, analysts said. At the close, wheat was 1 -LCB- cents to 6 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 4.05 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents lower to 1 cent higher with September at $ 2.90 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -RCB- cents to 3 cents lower with September at $ 2.66 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 6 -LCB- cents to 15 cents higher with September at $ 8.89 a bushel

He was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimson </ORGANIZATION> as an undergraduate, and has worked as a newspaper columnist and television moderator. `` This promises to be a lot of fun for a while,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said at a ceremony at <LOCATION> Forbes </LOCATION>' Fifth Avenue headquarters. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, who called journalism his `` first love,'' will be writing commentary in every issue. `` The kind of advice that he used to receive, he will now be giving,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. `` He brings a dimension of knowledge of American business and the operations of government. It's a unique combination.'' He replaces <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, 69, publisher since 1966. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> _ only the third publisher in the magazine's 71-year history and the first who was not a member of the <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> family _ will become vice chairman and consultant to the magazine. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said his decision to step down was personal. `` Some years ago <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> said to me, ` You know <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, you and I are going to go out feet first','' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. `` I decided against feet first.'' The previous publishers were <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> and his father, B.C. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, the magazine's founder. The biweekly magazine has a circulation of 735,000. `` My four Forbes-involved sons and I are really happy that <PERSON> Cap </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> is going to be helping us and our colleagues at the wheel of <LOCATION> Forbes </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, who is the magazine's editor-in-chief <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said he did not plan to move to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He maintains an apartment here. When asked what his salary as publisher would be, <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> practically gloated: `` I do n't know that it's a matter of public interest.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday it has awarded a $ 6.7 billion contract to the <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to operate the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, a nuclear weapons facility in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, for 5 -LCB- years beginning next spring. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>, which beat out <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for the contract, will replace the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as operator of the plant. Du Pont, which built the plant and operated it for more than 30 years, announced last fall it would not renew its contract when it expires next April. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON>, acting deputy energy secretary, said both <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> offered `` high-caliber proposals'' for the operating and management of the plant. `` The selection process resulted in the choice of the single proposer which I believe will operate <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> in the best interest of this nation,'' <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> has considerable experience in operating national defense facilities for the department.'' <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>, which currently operates six <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> nuclear facilities, will begin operations at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> on Nov. 1, working alongside <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> officials during a five-month transition period. <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> employees currently working at the plant will be guaranteed continued employment with <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> under terms of the contract, according to <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON>. `` We are extremely excited and very pleased at our selection,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marous </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are committed to total quality of all phases of operation at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Plant.'' Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the selection of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> `` and a timely transition will help to ensure that operations at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> are conducted in a safe and efficient manner. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> officials have assured him that they will operate the plant `` with the highest level of quality and productivity'' and will comply with all `` state-of-the-art environmental practices. `` In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to work for an improvement in the quality of life in the surrounding communities and to use the university structure in the state to assist in research and development at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, whose district includes the giant plant near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> border, said he was `` tremendously impressed'' with <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> officials during meetings prior to the awarding of the contract. `` There is no doubt in my mind about their commitment to the safe operation of <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> and their ability to ensure that local citizens and the environment are not harmed by <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> operations,'' <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON> said. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> last month recommended the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> as the site for construction of a new `` state-of-the-art'' nuclear reactor to produce all the tritium needed for the nation's nuclear weapons program. He also recommended constructon of a smaller nuclear reactor to produce weapons materials in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The new reactors eventually would replace three aging reactors at <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> and one at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. The three <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> reactors all currently are shut down for maintenance or safety reasons, and the Hanford reactor was placed on `` cold standby'' earlier this year. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> has submitted a proposal to <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> to design and build the new production reactor at <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION>, but Ms. <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the award of a contract for that project probably wo n't occur before next spring at the earliest.

Under terms of the mortgage, <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puskar </PERSON> said, the company would receive a portion of the revenue from <ORGANIZATION> Peachtree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> as well as an option in 10 years to become half owner of the project. The sale comes at a time when many downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> trophy properties are the objects of investors, mainly foreign, looking to acquire high-profile real estate. In a deal yet to be closed, <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is negotiating to buy the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s newest showpiece skyscraper, for $ 300 million.

M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plans to cut about 6,000 jobs in two years from its <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and expects to reduce employment elsewhere in the company as well, a spokesman said Thursday. The cuts in the <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the long-distance network, will amount to about 8 percent of the unit's 74,000 employees, spokesman <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said He said the total cuts could exceed 6,000. The company will try to achieve as many of the cuts as possible through voluntary retirements, resignations and reassignments to other parts of the company, but will not rule out layoffs, <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said. `` Virtually every organization in <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has the marching orders to reduce the number of non-sales-related jobs.

<HEAD>Dollar Advances Against Most Major Currencies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar advanced slightly against most major currencies Thursday after trading in a narrow range while the market awaited fresh news on the economy. Gold prices rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 428.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 427.50 late Wednesday. Currency analysts said there was little news to stir the markets after last week's higher unemployment figures sent the dollar tumbling. `` Most of the market is on the sidelines waiting for the PPIs tomorrow and the trades on Wednesday,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolicki </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think much will happen until they come out.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to release statistics Friday on the Producer Price Index for August, which measures wholesale prices and is an important indicator of inflation. Next Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will release numbers on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for July. `` The biggest thing the market is looking for are the trade figures,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Palfi </PERSON>, vice president of foreign exchange marketing for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` As they go, the dollar will go.'' Analysts said the dollar tried to move higher Thursday but then reacted negatively to a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement that a rise in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency would be counterproductive to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. The market also reacted negatively to later statements at a foreign exchange conference in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that the dollar was headed downward, analysts said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to a closing 134.20 Japanese yen from 134.30 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it slipped to 133.75 yen. The dollar reversed its slide against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, closing at 133.625 yen, compared with 133.325 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.6940 from $ 1.7060 late Wednesday. Later, in New Yorkthe pound cost $ 1.7000, compared with $ 1.7080 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared with levels late Wednesday included: 1.84625 West German marks, up from 1.84125; 1.5571 Swiss francs, up from 1.5530; 1.23975 Canadian dollars, up from 1.23755; 6.2865 French francs, up from 6.2760; and 1,383.00 Italian lire, up from 1,377.375.

Several large buy orders boosted gold bullion, but trading activity remained limited, dealers said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the metal rose to a late bid price of $ 428, up from $ 426.70 bid late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, it rose to $ 428.50 from $ 427.50 bid late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Speculators Push Soybean Futures To 7{-Week High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices registered their highest daily close since mid-July Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after new drought-damage estimates sparked a speculative rally. Wheat finished lower and corn futures were mixed. On other markets, energy, precious-metals and cocoa futures gained while livestock, meat and stock-index futures declined. The Agriculture Department wo n't release new crop production estimates until Monday afternoon. But private predictions issued Thursday indicate most analysts expect the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to again lower its estimates for the 1988 corn and soybean harvests. The estimates of about 30 trading companies averaged 1.4 billion bushels of soybeans, 25 percent less than last year's production of 1.9 billion bushels, and 4.2 billion bushels of corn, a 41 percent decline from last year's 7.1 billion bushels. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had estimated declines of 23 percent for soybeans and 37 percent for corn in its August crop production report. Speculators gave the soybean market its initial push, then technical traders turned buyers based on the improved chart signals, analysts said. Soybeans for November delivery, the first month for the new-crop beans, finished at $ 9.05 -LCB- a bushel, the highest close for that contract since it settled at $ 9.27 on July 18. `` It was a pretty impressive day,'' said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Balletto </PERSON>, soybean analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Balletto </PERSON> said the strong soybean meal market provided additional support. `` The meal market is very bullish,'' he said. `` Prices are still too low and that's certainly spilling over.'' The wheat market ended a 6-day rally, settling lower on disappointment over slow export sales and reports the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was negotiating a large purchase of European wheat and barley, analysts said. `` We're not the only ones they're buying from and that's kind of negative,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, grain analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with the G.H. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> division of <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat settled 2 -LCB- cents to 5 -LCB- cents lower with September at $ 4.06 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with September at $ 2.90 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -RCB- cents to 3 cents lower with September at $ 2.66 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 15 cents higher with September at $ 8.89 -LCB- a bushel Oil futures prices rebounded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after five straight days of declines that had left them at their lowest point in nearly two years. Analysts said the increase was partly technical in nature and partly caused by a reassessment of the intentions of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Prices had been knocked down this week by rumors that the Saudis were offering volume discounts to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But stories Thursday contradicted those rumors and said any price cuts the Saudis offered to the Japanese would not be mirrored by price cuts elsewhere, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 32 cents higher with October at $ 14.48 a barrel; heating oil was .24 cent to .43 cent higher with October at 41.87 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .25 cent lower to .40 cent higher with October at 42.99 cents a gallon The advance in the oil market helped to boost the inflation-sensitive precious metals futures, with platinum leading the way. Platinum settled $ 9.60 to $ 10.10 higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with October at $ 537.50 a troy ounce. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold was 60 cents to 70 cents higher with October at $ 430.80 a troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 7.2 cents higher with September at $ 6.612 a troy ounce. The battered cocoa market rebounded on reports that discussions between producer and consumer nation-members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> were centering on ways to support prices. Some analysts had expected the two-week meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to accomplish nothing except to hasten the demise of the price-stabilization group. Cocoa settled $ 28 to $ 46 higher with September at $ 1,219 a metric ton. Cattle futures prices fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in response to denials of Wednesday's rumor that a large <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> meatpacker had signed a long-term agreeement to supply beef to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, livestock market analyst in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Lind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waldock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Pork futures retreated in sympathy with cattle, he said Live cattle settled .18 cent to 1.27 cents lower with October at 70.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to 1.37 cents lower with September at 80.70 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent to .47 cent lower with October at 38.10 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .62 cent to 1.03 cents lower with February at 47.07 cents a pound. Stock index futures settled mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index was unchanged at 266.10 points.

<HEAD>Hyatt Makes $397 Million Offer for Ramada Inc.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hyatt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> offered Thursday to buy rival hotelier <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for an estimated $ 397 million. Ramada officials were noncommittal after Hyatt announced its bid, but investors reacted enthusiastically to the offer, bidding <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> stock up $ 2.12 -LCB- a share to $ 9.75 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. Hyatt chief <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> made the offer in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rugen </PERSON> said. `` We have believed for some time that an affiliation of our companies would be mutually beneficial,'' <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>'s letter said. Spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the Ramada board would meet to discuss the offer before the close of business next Friday, the deadline set by <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> in his letter. <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>'s letter said the proposal would expire `` if you have not indicated a sincere desire on or before'' the deadline set. `` Should you choose not to commence a dialogue with us or should market conditions warrant, we may take unilateral action to increase our stake in the company or to dispose of any or all or any part thereof.'' Neither Cole nor Ms. <PERSON> Rugen </PERSON> could comment beyond company statements when asked whether the offer was considered hostile. Hyatt offered to pay $ 10 for each of <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION>'s 39.7 million outstanding shares, or a total of $ 397 million. <ORGANIZATION> HCC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Hyatt </LOCATION> affiliate, already holds 2.8 million shares, or 7.2 percent, of Ramada stock, Ms. <PERSON> Rugen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said it has been known for some time that the <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family, which founded the closely-held Hyatt, has been interested in <LOCATION> Ramada </LOCATION>. `` The last conversation before this offer -LRB- was in -RRB- March of this year,'' he said. At that time, Ramada officials told Hyatt officials they were not interested, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>'s letter said <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON> had cash on hand for the transaction. `` Our proposal to acquire all of the equity of the company is not conditioned upon financing and we have available sufficient funds to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,'' <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> wrote. Ramada companies operate 800 hotels, mostly moderately priced, in 40 countries. They include <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inns </ORGANIZATION>, Rodeway motels and the upscale Ramada Rennaissance hotels. <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> also owns 135 restaurants in the <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Callender </PERSON>'s chain, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. In 1987, the company had revenue of $ 226.6 million from hotels, $ 406.8 million from gaming operations and $ 113.1 million from restaurants, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. Hyatt subsidiaries, all owned by the <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family, operate 144 luxury hotels in many major cities worldwide, Ms. <PERSON> Rugen </PERSON> said. Hyatt in 1985 announced plans to build 40 hotels by late 1990 in areas outside the the major cities which had formed the base of its business. Ms. <PERSON> Rugen </PERSON> would not comment Thursday when asked if the proposed acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> was linked to that plan.

 Thousands of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commuters were spared a morning `` rush-hour nightmare'' when the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> railway and one of its unions agreed Thurssday to delay a likely strike. `` Both sides agree that this is a step that is in the best interest of commuters,'' 41,000 of whom use C & amp; NW commuter trains serving the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carle </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill. The 2,600 members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> at the railroad had planned to walk off their jobs at 12:01 a.m. CDT Friday, when a 36-day cooling-off period ends and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had planned to lay off 1,150 of the 2,300 union brakemen in its 10-state freight operation. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> late Thursday gave unanimous approval to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s bill implementing recommendations of a presidential emergency board, which in July called for trimming 689 brakemen. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointed the panel in April to study the labor dispute and seek a solution. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> predicted the measure would sail through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Friday and win quick approval from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He said the bill could be passed by late morning and signed an hour or so later by the president. Under the Railway Labor act, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president have specific authority to settle railroad disputes that threaten national commerce. The railroad and the union have been battling for more than a year over the size of train crews on C & amp; NW freight trains. The company contends the brakemen's jobs are obsolete and that trains can be run with a two - or three-man crew _ an engineer, a conductor and, in some cases, a fireman The union contends the brakemen _ two on each train's crew _ are necessary to maintain railroad safety. The two sides have failed to reach a compromise and earlier this week had implemented strike plans. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Markgraf </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> general chairman, said he opposes federal intervention, but that the union would honor the settlement if it is approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The railroad expects <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to push through the legislation, said <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; NW spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON>, but he noted that management personnel had been deployed throughout the freight system and about 8,000 replacement workers had been recalled. C & amp; NW commuters also were bracing for a walkout _ the third threatened this year. The <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> struck C & amp; NW for about four hours Aug. 4, after an earlier cooling-off period imposed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. During that period, the special presidential board proposed a compromise to end the impasse. Both sides then rejected the proposal _ the one now going before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ setting the stage for the August strike. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, however, ended that strike quickly by imposing a second cooling-off period.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cumming </PERSON> has made a $ 1.2 billion cash bid for a majority interest in <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an offer that is about $ 600 million less than one made a year ago by Oregon-based <ORGANIZATION> Pacificorp </ORGANIZATION> and accepted by <ORGANIZATION> UP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> L. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> UP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> said the privately held utility, which is in the process of trying to gain regulatory approval for a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Pacificorp </ORGANIZATION>, has not responded to <PERSON> Cumming </PERSON>'s offer. He said the company had no further comment. <PERSON> Cumming </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> and is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Leucadia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> holding company with sales of $ 320 million in 1986, could not be reached for comment Thursday. A woman who answered the phone at <PERSON> Cumming </PERSON>'s home said he was not expected home until Monday. His <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office referred calls to a <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindle </PERSON>. Swindle said <PERSON> Cumming </PERSON> made the offer through a letter to <ORGANIZATION> UP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L directors in June. The lawyer confirmed the bid is a cash offer of $ 30 per share for at least 67 percent of <ORGANIZATION> UP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L stock, totaling $ 1.2 billion. Swindle said it would be premature to discuss how the acquisition would be financed. UP & amp; L stock closed at $ 30.12 -LCB- a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Thursday, up 25 cents. <PERSON> Cumming </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Leucadia </ORGANIZATION> have expressed concern that a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Pacificorp </ORGANIZATION> would not be in the best interest of the state, or UP & amp; L's customers and shareholders, <PERSON> Swindle </PERSON> said. `` UP & amp; L has historically played an important role in the state and should remain a free-standing company, based in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and not part of a regional power company,'' Swindle said. Under terms of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacificorp </ORGANIZATION> merger, <ORGANIZATION> UP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L would become a division of <ORGANIZATION> Pacificorp </ORGANIZATION> and be part of an $ 8 billion system serving seven western states. Utility commissions in all those states, including <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, have approved the merger, but it has since been stalled at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION> administrative law judge has recommended the commission deny the merger because of possible anti-competitive impact The <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION> is expected to make its final ruling later this month. In <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pacificorp </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Chenoweth </PERSON> said the report of the Cumming offer caught her by surprise but that it should have no effect on the merger. `` We have an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> UP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L, and that merger agreement is in force,'' said <PERSON> Chenoweth </PERSON>. `` We fully expect to receive approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to go ahead'' with the merger. <PERSON> Chenoweth </PERSON> pointed out that the <ORGANIZATION> PacificCorp-UP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L merger has already been voted on and agreed to by shareholders of both companies and approved by regulatory agencies in seven states. `` So there's no reaction for us to make. We're just going ahead,'' she said. Despite the delay at <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION>, state regulators and industry analysts expressed skepticism about <ORGANIZATION> Leucadia </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. `` The consideration is that the <ORGANIZATION> Leucadia </ORGANIZATION> offer is lower than what <ORGANIZATION> Pacificorp </ORGANIZATION> will offer,'' said utilities analyst <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Enholm </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pacificorp </ORGANIZATION>'s minimum offer under its stock swap agreement is for $ 32.50 per share. `` The major consideration is that UP & amp; L is not in good financial shape, and the merger could solve those problems,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Leucadia </ORGANIZATION> is a holding company with banking, real estate and life insurance subsidiaries. Local holdings include <ORGANIZATION> Leucadia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, formerly Terracor; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION>; and minority ownership in <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Leucadia </ORGANIZATION> also owns interests in <ORGANIZATION> PHLCORP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION> Baldwin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> BRAE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cumming </PERSON> is chairman of both

 <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has reopened five <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> mills after workers ratified a three-year contract. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Elder </PERSON>, a Champion spokesman, said Tuesday the wood products company would bring back its 2,400 union workers on a staggered basis. The mills had been idle since the workers struck June 6. Elder predicted it would be late this week or early next week before all mills were running normally again.

The Champion settlement left about 2,700 timber workers still on strike in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, spokesmen for the two unions said Wednesday. Some 5,200 <ORGANIZATION> IWA </ORGANIZATION> members and 800 <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members are voting this week on a proposed settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.
