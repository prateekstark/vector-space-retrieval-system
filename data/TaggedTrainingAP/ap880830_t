 A businessman defeated a city planner Tuesday in a Republican primary runoff for the right to challenge Democratic Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, while a late-breaking campaign financing controversy complicated another state race. According to unofficial returns from all 207 precincts, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamutt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> had 6,220 votes, or 52 percent, to 5,691, or 48 percent, for <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Roswell </LOCATION> planner. The two were the surviving candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s 7th District nomination after the primary election three weeks ago. The race was thrown into a runoff when neither could claim a majority. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> was unopposed in the Democratic congressional primary. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s only statewide primary runoff, former state Sen. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> won the Democratic nomination for a seat on the utility-regulating <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday after a bitter fight with state Rep. <PERSON> Cathey </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. According to unofficial returns from 2,290 of the 2,569 precincts, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> had 216,321, or 55 percent, to Ms. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s 176,175, or 45 percent While polls were still open, a transcript unsealed in federal court indicated <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> supervisors and managers were pressured to make contributions to <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>. Utility officials said that would violate `` a very important policy'' of the company, and <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> called the allegations `` reckless and unfounded.'' In a mid-evening telephone interview after the contest appeared concluded, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> refused to say he would decline future contributions from sources with power company interests. `` If I go on the commission, we ought to talk about what we're going to do about this,'' he said `` I should n't try to stand out as an island by myself.'' Ms. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said, `` I'm not going to win; the utilities are going to win. My opponent beat me to death with a money bag.'' She said <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> distorted her legislative record in ads aired throughout the state and described the campaign as `` very nasty.''

 Leaking rocket fuel forced the evacuation of a Titan 2 launch pad during the weekend, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> declined to confirm whether the mishap Sunday delayed the classified launch of four <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spy satellites. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, a space policy expert at the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientists </ORGANIZATION>, said last week that a classified Titan 2 launch was expected soon. He said the one-time intercontinental ballistic missile, in its maiden flight as a space booster, was almost certain to carry into orbit a set of four <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cloud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> Surveillance System satellites designed to eavesdrop on radio and radar transmissions by the Soviet fleet. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have previously said that <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Launch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION> 4 West will be used to launch refurbished Titan 2s carrying military payloads. `` We had a minor vapor escape of monomethyl hydrazine at Space Launch Complex 4 West this weekend,'' said Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> and Missile Test Organization at this military base 140 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The leak was detected by our sensors and the pad was evacuated with our safety procedures,'' he added. `` The vapor dispersed harmlessly into the atmosphere. At no time was there any danger to the base or community population'' in nearby <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> or the neighboring city of <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> emphasized the leak was n't serious, but said he did n't know how many people were evacuated from the launch pad He also declined comment on whether a Titan 2 was being loaded with the hydrazine fuel to prepare it for a classified launch. For about 25 years, Titan 2 rockets served as ICBMs, each carrying a nine-megaton hydrogen warhead. Maintenance and safety problems spurred removal of the obsolete missiles from their silos in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has ordered 13 Titan 2s reconditioned as space boosters under a $ 528.9 million contract with <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> because it was cheaper than building new rockets.

<HEAD>Farmers' 1989 Income Forecast Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says there is some likelihood that farmers' net cash income in 1989 will drop from this year's level, even if there are drought-busting rains and production increases. According to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, production expenses `` may increase substantially'' in calendar 1989, judging from what has happened after previous droughts and an expected boost in plantings as a result of relaxed acreage set-aside requirements. `` As in the second half of 1988, higher feed prices will affect 1989's costs,'' the agency said in a new outlook report. `` Higher prices for feeder cattle likely will help boost livestock incomes. For crops, bigger planted acreage will boost expenditures for seed, fertilizer, chemical and fuels.'' The report in the September issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine by economists <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kodl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernat </PERSON> said 1988 net cash farm income is expected to be in the range of $ 55 billion to $ 60 billion, near last year's record of $ 57.1 billion. They offered no specific figure for 1989 income. <PERSON> Bernat </PERSON> said Monday that the first official projections for 1989 farm income wo n't be made until November but that `` we thought it would add something'' to the report by including some of the factors down the road. As used by the agency, net cash income in a calendar year is the difference between gross cash income _ which includes government payments in addition to farm sales receipts _ and cash expenses. The economists noted that higher prices for some commodities hit hard by drought have more than offset losses due to drought, on a national scale. The rub is that only those farmers whose crops were not hurt severely are able to benefit from the higher prices, unless they hold inventories from earlier harvests. For 1988, crop sales receipts are forecast at $ 66 billion to $ 68 billion, up from $ 59 billion in 1987 and reversing two years of decline, the report said. Livestock receipts this year may be in the range of $ 77 billion to $ 79 billion, compared with $ 77 billion in 1987. `` Consistent with recent droughts, this year's livestock receipts will probably be relatively stable,'' the report said. `` This year's smaller cattle herd appears to limit cullings, thus preventing substantial price weakening.'' The report added: `` Also contributing to lower-than-expected cullings is the fact that the five largest cattle-producing states -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> -RRB- have not been as hard hit by the drought as many other states.'' Crop deficiency payments to farmers are declining as a result of higher market prices, with the greatest effects likely in 1989. Also, if a large portion of the $ 3.9 billion drought emergency payments authorized recently go to farmers by the year's end, that will mean further 1989 reductions in benefits. `` Following the drought, next year's crop prices may remain higher, and crop production will increase,'' the report said. `` This would boost total cash receipts. However, it seems unlikely that revenue gains will compensate for reduced federal supports and higher operating costs.''

 Fed by what appears to be another bumper cotton crop in the making, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supply could be pushed to a 22-year high in 1988-89, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts. Based on Aug. 1 indications, the cotton harvest could be 14.9 million bales, up from 14.8 million bales last year. The increase would result from a larger acreage this year, despite a reduction in per-acre yields. In all, counting cotton left over from previous harvests, the total 1988-89 supply will be about 20.5 million bales, the most since the 1966-67 season, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Because domestic and export use is not keeping pace with production, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cotton stockpile when the next marketing year begins on Aug. 1, 1989, could rise to 8.9 million bales from an estimated carryover of 5.6 million bales this Aug. 1, the agency reported. Meanwhile, world cotton production in 1988-89 is expected to rise to nearly 86 million bales, up 7 percent from last season. Foreign production, at about 71 million bales, is expected to gain 5 million bales, including record crops in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. World cotton consumption, forecast at nearly 83 million bales, will about match last season, the report said. Cotton use is expected to increase primarily among producing countries, while falling among importers. As a result, world cotton stocks are expected to increase nearly 9 percent in 1988-89 to more than 35 million bales by the end of the season. All of the buildup will occur in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, while foreign inventories are expected to decline 2 percent. The report said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cotton `` has not been priced competitively in world markets for several months'' and that reduced export sales, along with large crops last year and in 1988 translate into the rise in inventories.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says safety concerns prompted its request that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> cut back drastically on the number of people allowed on a close-in press site to cover next month's launch of space shuttle Discovery. In the past, there have been as many as 3,500 people on the press mound during a launch at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> already has processed 2,600 news media applications for the Discovery launch. <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> declined to specify the number the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> wants to allow, but the number circulating around the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is 100 _ including <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> public affairs personnel. Those excluded would be allowed back onto the press site soon after the shuttle lifts off. As discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> continued, top <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> managers met Monday and decided not to set a specific launch date until after a detailed preparedness review on Sept. 13-14. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has been working toward a liftoff of the first post-Challenger mission in the last week of September. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, which has jurisdiction over safety at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Kennedy facility, is worried about flying shrapnel should one of the solid rocket boosters explode `` They are asking us ` what are the minimum numbers you can have there and still be able to operate effectively?''' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. He said 6,000 to 7,000 space center workers not involved with the shuttle on the pad also might be barred for some period preceding launches. The press site and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s huge vehicle assembly building are 4.2 miles from pad 34-B. Reporters have been there for every launch beginning with the Apollo program in 1967. `` They have some real basis for concern,'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. `` It came about because of what they learned after the Challenger -LRB- accident -RRB- and what they learned from the Atlas that had to be destroyed. `` What they learned is you ca n't predict where it's going to go. It can go down, it can go forward, it can go up.'' After the Challenger shuttle was engulfed in flames 73 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, killing its crew of seven, the Challenger's booster rockets careened about over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> for another minute before they were destroyed by a command from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> safety officer. In March 1987, an Atlas Centaur rocket had to be destroyed 51 seconds into its flight when it started to tumble. No one on the ground was injured in either incident. Before Challenger, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said, engineers assumed the booster rockets would continue on the same path if they were released during flight, perhaps tumbling. `` The detonation of the <ORGANIZATION> SRB </ORGANIZATION> is not as clean as everyone thought it was,'' he said. `` It breaks apart at different times and has debris as large as an automobile and as small as a piece of small shrapnel. The issue concerns the spread of debris and the fragmentation of the <ORGANIZATION> SRB </ORGANIZATION> when it disintegrates.''

 The man who would be president came to the shores of <LOCATION> Pontoosuc </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> with a mission, and a rather large following. The housing development here was one stop Monday for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on a nostalgic trip with all the trappings of a gubernatorial re-election campaign: talk of the rebound from double-digit unemployment, plans to convert an abandoned mill into a major art museum, and praise of partnership after partnership that has spurred western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' sudden resurgence. It was the sixth such annual visit for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but this time things are a bit different: he's running for president, not governor. While <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> denounce <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as soft on crime and weak on defense while questioning his patriotism, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has spent two days in each of the past three weeks touring his home state talking about home ownership, health care, economic development and drunken driving. Those are all important issues, to be sure, but such talk has for the most part been lost in the aggressive tone of the early campaign. On Monday, for example, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> defense plant and characterized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as opposed to every modern weapon system `` since the slingshot.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was here at a lakefront housing development, touting his Homeownership Opportunity Program, which made it possible for moderate-income families to buy their first homes in an area that otherwise would have been out of their price range. This at a time when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is being criticized for allowing his presidential campaign to lose its edge, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to surge ahead in the polls. `` I am the sitting governor of this state and I've got to do my job,'' was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' straight answer to a simple question: What was he doing here? There were complaints from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides that his message was being obscured by coverage of the attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the controversy over the Quayle selection. `` It's been a little difficult to get through,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a huge understatment. But the problems are n't all the doings of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the media's Quayle hunt <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has offered few new national ideas during his regional trips at home and has focused most of his dicussion on state programs. Many of these initiatives, in fact, are models for the nation, used as examples in shaping congressional proposals ranging from the National Economic Development Act to major welfare reform. And had these trips come at another time, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> might get out of them what his campaign wants: media coverage of some of his most successful programs, several of which he touts almost daily when campaigning for the presidency. But with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> criss-crossing the country pushing their agenda and slamming <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his attempt to talk about public-private partnership, health care and jobs _ to bring the campaign, in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' words, `` up where it belongs'' _ has been frustrating. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for sure, has n't faced any questions, or protests, lately over the Route 7 interchange proposal here in <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>. But opponents of the plan to widen the rural highway from two lanes to four at the cost of more than 20 homes turned out Monday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appears undaunted by the recent criticism, much of which has come from the large media contigent he has brought with him to <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION> this week, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> last week and <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> the week before. `` I am a sitting governor and I do have a responsibility to the citizens of this state,'' he told curious reporters Monday. But his post-Labor Day schedule will have him in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> less frequently and his only remaining regional visit _ to southeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> _ is scheduled for just one day. None of the criticism of the backyard stumping has been lost on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who was perhaps mindful of it when he delivered this promise Monday: `` The dog days of August are almost over.''

 Americans are giving less to the two major political parties, and Republicans hold a smaller fund-raising lead over Democrats than before, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> said in a report released Monday that contributions to five fund-raising committees operated by each party totaled some $ 226 million during the first 18 months of the 1987-88 election cycle. That was well below the $ 267 million the 10 committees took in during the corresponding period in 1983-84 when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was heading for a second term as president. The $ 226 million also was about $ 1 million below the combined take for the first 18 months of the 1985-86 cycle, a non-presidential election period when contributions usually are less than in presidential years. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> said contributions to the five <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> committees totaled $ 166.19 million during the 18 months ending June 30, compared with $ 59.84 million raised by the five Democratic counterparts in the same period. That left the Republicans in front by $ 106.35 million, but their lead was smaller than the $ 152.7 million bulge during the corresponding period in 1985-86 and the $ 147.85 million advantage for the first three quarters of the 1983-84 election cycle. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> report covered the finances of the Democratic and Republican national committees; their <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign committees; their national convention funds; and their state-local finance committees. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> saw its 1987-88 receipts fall to $ 61.58 million, the lowest point for a similar 18-month period during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency. Corresponding figures were $ 64.16 million in 1985-86, $ 75.23 million in 1983-84 and $ 65.75 million in 1981-82. <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, the committee's communications director, blamed the falloff on poor response to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s direct-mail solicitations in the first and second quarters of 1987. During this period, the scandals that rocked the television evangelists hurt direct-mail appeals by the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and a variety of non-political fund-raisers, according to <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. She said that since then, contributions have picked up, with the second quarter of this year running second only to a three-month period in 1984. The National Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which support <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates in races for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, also showed lower receipts in the first 18 months of this election cycle. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee reported contributions of $ 42.3 million, down from a 1980s high of $ 65.81 million in 1985-86. The House apparatus had receipts of $ 21.32 million, nearly half the $ 41.96 it had in the first 18 months of the 1983-84 cycle. On the Democratic side, contributions to the five entities in the current cycle were only about $ 98,000 above where they were at the same period in the last presidential cycle. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which relies less than its Republican counterpart on direct-mail solicitations, had receipts of $ 16.85 million, down from the $ 29.76 million taken in during 1983-84. This drop, however, was offset by increased giving to the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees and their committees for state and local party affairs. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel received $ 11.42 million, compared with a previous high of $ 7.56 million in 1985-86. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel was at $ 9.45 million, up from $ 8.74 million in 1985-86. The state-local share was $ 12.64 million, compared with a previous high of $ 10.97 million in 1983-84.

 A moose, bear and ranger dash around the flames in Yellowstone National Park. `` Would the last one out of the park please put the fire out!'' So says one of the T-shirts <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> sells to tourists looking in the Wild West Mercantile for a memento of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>'s unprecedented 1988 fire season. The `` fire shirts,'' as <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> calls them, are among the few good things to come out of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s wildfires, which have blackened more than 450,000 of the park's 2.2 million acres during the past two months. One T-shirt's design carries a map of the park with the various fires pinpointed in fire-engine red. Another portrays a <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> entrance sign with a sketch of Old Faithful geyser, whose upper reaches have been transformed from steam into flame. `` We'd been asked if we had anything before we had any,'' <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> said Sunday. `` It's worked out pretty well,'' Up the street from <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>'s store, <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' Savage Shop also has found a steady demand for fire shirts. One he offers portrays a bear lounging at the mouth of a cave, bone _ human, presumably _ in paw, saying, `` Send more firefighters, the last ones were delicious!'' `` Everybody always thought that the park's fires would deter them -LRB- tourists -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>, pressing a `` Wildfires 1988'' logo onto a cap. `` But I think it brings more people. A national disaster. Everybody's been coming to see Yellowstone National Park on fire.''

 A pair of entrepreneurs turned rejection into a profitable business venture by creating a fraternity that anybody can join, even women, and everybody is president. `` Fraternities are elitist organizations,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Southwick </PERSON>, cofounder of Sigma Phi Nothing. `` We feel that everyone should be special.'' <PERSON> Southwick </PERSON>, 24, his 21-year-old partner, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Toth </PERSON>, launched <ORGANIZATION> Sigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nothing </ORGANIZATION> after an unhappy rush week at one of <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s fraternity houses. `` I got in and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> did n't and that kind of upset us both.

As their story spread, they sold more than 300 shirts in a few weeks. Then a marketing company expressed interest in selling the fraternity idea nationwide. The two have spent the summer developing plans for selling the T-shirts at Big Ten schools this fall. So far, the fledgling company has expanded its inventory to include sweatshirts, corduroy caps and bumper stickers. And the T-shirt price has risen to $ 11.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> on Monday ended a 23-hour session by approving the last of 300 congressmen elected directly to the Chamber of Deputies during balloting in July that the opposition says was fraudulent. The body then postponed until Tuesday night its certification of the elections of 200 other deputies assigned to the different parties according to a proportional representation formula. The <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, made up of the newly elected members of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, began its marathon session at 1 p.m. Sunday and ended it shortly after noon Monday. Protests from opposition parties, accusing the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, of fraud in the July 6 elections, delayed the certification process. The delay raised the small possibility there would not be a quorum for the opening session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday and threatened President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s state of the nation speech that day. Under the constitution, the president must attend the opening session and by tradition that is when he delivers the state of the nation address. If the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> does not have the 251 seats for a majority in the 500-member Chamber of Deputies an opposition boycott could cancel the session. The Electoral College began the certification process, seat by seat, on Aug. 15 and in the results announed Monday the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> won 235 of the 300 seats. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had 36 and leftist parties backing presidential candidate <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> received 29. An earlier official vote count by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> 247 seats in the 500 member chamber and opposition parties 227 with 26 in dispute. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> has dominated Mexican politics since 1929 and this year for the first time it will not have the two-thirds majority required to amend the constitution. Opposition parties claim the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has not released results from about 25,000 polling places. They say those would show that <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate, did not win the 50.36 percent of the vote awarded him in official results. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> received 31.12 percent of the vote in the official results and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, the candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, 17.07 percent.

The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> has finished certifying all its members.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is abandoning efforts to get the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> kicked out of offices at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, while continuing to fight any attempt to reopen a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, following what one source described as a bitter internal fight over the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> issue, decided not to appeal a judge's ruling that allowed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to maintain its <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office. A year-old law had ordered the administration to close <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> facilities in both <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON> on June 29 struck down the provision regarding the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office, saying obligations to the international body took precedence. Monday was the deadline for appealing <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON>'s order. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the decision not to fight <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON>'s order `` was based on a determination that, on balance, the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are best served by not appealing. The department said its `` normal policy'' was to appeal adverse district court decisions of this kind, but `` it was decided, in light of foreign policy considerations, including the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role as host to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> organization, not to appeal in this instance.'' The department said, however, it would continue to oppose any effort to reopen the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had opposed <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> efforts to launch an appeal, according to <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> officials who spoke on condition they not be identified. The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 required closure of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> offices on ground that the organization sponsors terrorism The administration had opposed enactment of the anti-terrorism measure, saying it could possibly violate international obligations. But once the act became law, the administration moved to enforce it. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, which has no <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> affiliation, was shut down, but <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office must remain open because of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> obligations under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Headquarters Agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s representative in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, praised the administration's decision, saying it `` is the only sensible thing to do because otherwise they would have pursued the misguided policy of confrontation with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and of acquiescence with the pro-Israel lobby in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> was shut down by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last year, now heads the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> which operates out of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> offices. Republican Sens. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> had urged the administration to proceed with an appeal. `` At issue is the question of who determines the sovereign powers of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president through the constitutional process, or the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and a single District Court judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> wrote in a letter to White House chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> both said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to control access to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be hampered by allowing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office to remain open. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> added there was `` clear and irrefutable evidence'' that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> sponsored terrorism. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, in a letter to Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> last week, said he intended `` to proceed further in this matter'' once <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns after the August recess.

 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s besieged government and military may be deliberately pushing the country toward anarchy in an attempt to reassert control after 26 years of authoritarian rule, diplomats and other analysts say. Remaining silent since Aug. 19, the government has withdrawn troops and police from the streets while looting and other crimes reportedly go unchecked. Civilian administration has ceased to function in many areas. There have been increasing reports and some witness accounts of military agents seeking to provoke tensions. The state media has reported nine almost simultaneous prison uprisings in widely different areas of the country and the escape or release of nearly 9,000 inmates. `` My impression is it is strongly possible that this chaos is being planned by state authorities to give them good reasons to intervene eventually,'' said a Japanese diplomat in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> capital. However, others, also speaking on condition of anonymity, caution that with virtually no access to the current leadership analysts can at best make educated guesses on its intentions. One Western diplomat watching developments from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said the drift towards chaos may simply reflect confusion within the leadership coupled with an `` arrogance, an unwillingess to accept that they have to give up.'' `` There's an obvious vacuum with students and others trying to find some leadership. The obvious people to step into the vacuum are the military, conspiratorially or not,'' an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said. The leadership withdrew into itself following the announcement Aug. 19 _ after months of bloody anti-government rioting in which hundreds were killed _ that civilian lawyer <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> had replaced the widely hated <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> as president and head of the sole political party. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s promise of a referendum on Sept. 12 that would pave the way for democracy did not quiet the protests that have erupted throughout <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in the past month. Unsatisfied opposition leaders demanded an interim government and the end of one-party rule. A number of Burmese and some outsider observers believed that <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who formally retired in late July after wielding almost absolute power for 26 years, was still pulling strings behind the scenes along with loyal military officers. Leaders have urged that demonstrations remain peaceful so the government can not take advantage of the turmoil. `` The public must be united and well disciplined ... people must be alert to prevent machinations of destructive elements to create anarchy in the country,'' a former defense minister, Tin Oo, told an anti-government rally last week. In <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and other areas, `` democracy centers'' and block committees have replaced judicial and civil authorities to maintain law and order. Whether such makeshift measures will stop the growing lawlessness, widespread strikes, soaring commodity prices and food shortages remains a crucial question. One Swedish journalist and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> expert, <PERSON> Bertil </PERSON> <PERSON> Lintner </PERSON>, notes that <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> and his military followers used the pretext of domestic turmoil and threats to national security to seize power from a democratic government in 1962. `` The government ca n't control the situation so they are letting things get worse. They hope the people will beg them to come back. It's vicious,'' <PERSON> Lintner </PERSON> said, quoting a <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> proverb that translates: `` If you ca n't eat the beef yourself, throw sand on it.'' One Bangkok-based diplomat said the students and other anti-government forces might react dramatically to keep up their hitherto remarkable momentum. `` The students have been the engine of change and used a lot of imagination. But now they have to take a new initiative,'' he said. `` There appears to be a paralysis in the government. A hiatus has set in and nobody knows what to do next,'' the diplomat said. Referring to Ne Win, he added: `` In every dictator there is an element of contempt for the people. He ca n't accept that the people no longer want him.''

<HEAD>Ban On New Industry In L.A. Smog Basin Largely Symbolic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RIC LEYVA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federally ordered building ban on major new <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> polluters is largely symbolic because the region has no plans for heavy industries, fuel refineries or power generating plants, officials say. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Monday announced plans to ban construction of industry emitting more than 100 tons of carbon monoxide or ozone pollutants a year as a congressional moratorium on such sanctions expires. The ban could be extended to more than a dozen other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> locations, including <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> comes under the sanctions slated to take effect at midnight because the air pollution control plan submitted to the agency was rejected. The order came as no surprise to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lents </PERSON>, executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, who said it would do nothing to reduce smog in the nation's largest and most populous urban area. A lawsuit by environmentalists resulted in a January federal court order requiring the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to reject the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> plan because it failed to bring regional air quality into compliance with a 10-year deadline set by the 1977 Clean Air Act, <PERSON> Lents </PERSON> said. `` We've known for some time that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did n't act, the construction ban would go into effect,'' said <PERSON> Lents </PERSON>, who oversees smog eradication efforts in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> counties. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> ban only affects heavy sources of pollution such as oil refineries, power plants or automotive factories. No such plants are planned for the region, <PERSON> Lents </PERSON> said. `` Based on the permit applications we've received this year and last, the ban will have absolutely no effect on smog abatement in the short run,'' <PERSON> Lents </PERSON> said, adding that it will take at least 20 years to clear <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> smog to acceptable levels. `` There will be some psychological impact, certainly,'' <PERSON> Lents </PERSON> said. He said he hoped the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> move would spur <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to revise the Clean Air Act and allow cities more time to clear smog. `` A complete solution calls for federal action,'' he said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needs something to motivate them, but I'm afraid this wo n't be enough.'' Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> hailed the ban as a signal that the federal government cares about reducing air pollution, even though the effects may be insignificant. `` While it will not have a major impact on the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> economy,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said, `` the construction ban on major stationary pollution sources re-emphasizes the difficult air quality challenge facing cities and counties of this area.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement followed a weekend `` Air Pollution Summit'' at City Hall organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Campaign </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which were brought together by Assemblyman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>. Among other proposals, speakers called for tight controls on urban growth. `` <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has intolerable levels of air pollution,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said. `` I'm told current smog levels will expose everybody in the basin to toxic pollution 200 to 300 percent above acceptable health standards.'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was one of about 100 metropolitan areas that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said missed December's deadline to contain smog at acceptable levels. Because of its weather and terrain, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has by far the nation's highest ozone concentrations. <PERSON> Lents </PERSON> said his agency will present a draft of a new 20-year smog reduction plan that would go to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> for approval. Before the end of the year, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> expects to adopt a policy requiring areas not meeting pollution standards to demonstrate steady progress, with a goal of an average 3 percent reduction in pollution concentrations annually. When it adopts that policy, the agency will decide whether to impose construction bans at <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Decisions on similar construction bans are pending for <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and for the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Thirty years of firefighting have n't steeled fire boss <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> `` Ponce'' Poncin against the worst fear a commander harbors while calling the shots against a fire. `` I think the biggest fear is killing someone, injuring people,'' <PERSON> Poncin </PERSON> said during a break from his command of the 85,000-acre North Fork fire that is eating through <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>'s forests. He especially dreads aircraft accidents. `` When a helicopter goes down, there are usually fatalities. When there are n't, you count your blessings.'' But in eight years as a fire boss, the soft-spoken man who seems to have a minute for everyone has never realized his greatest fear. He knows, too, that he's been lucky. <PERSON> Poncin </PERSON> called a helicopter crash earlier this month in the <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, in which one firefighter died and three were injured, a `` harbinger, or an alert,'' for his squad of tactical firefighters. `` It's not unexpected,'' he added. `` It just seems like there's more potential for accidents,'' <PERSON> Poncin </PERSON> said, especially considering the long weeks of firefighting; the beating the helicopters take; and the stress that the crews and the machines endure. Relaxing in a lawn chair at his Madison Junction fire base, the 51-year-old <PERSON> Poncin </PERSON> looked back on his 30 years with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and did n't mention a single regret. He also said he's learned how to live with, but not forget, his fears `` It accumulates with you, and when you think back over the years, you think of the bad things,'' he said. As a boy growing up in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, he looked up to his uncle in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and longed for the day when he could head west and join the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Poncin </PERSON> got his chance out of high school, when he worked as a smoke jumper, parachuting into strategic hot spots, in northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> to pay his way through college. Now based in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, where he is an assistant to the forest supervisor, <PERSON> Poncin </PERSON> spends summers as the leader of 10 people who make up one of the nation's few forest fire overhead teams, who coordinate the firefighting of major forest fires. From the beginning of May until the end of October he and his team live on two-hour standby, always knowing that wherever they are, they can immediately be summoned to a fire. But <PERSON> Poncin </PERSON> would n't want it any other way. `` Firefighting is a lot like circuses,'' he said. `` It gets in your blood. Part of it is the people -LRB- you work with -RRB-. Part of it is the challenge of chasing and catching a big fire.'' In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> during this unusually dry summer, <PERSON> Poncin </PERSON> has mostly been chasing. He spent 14 days as commanding the forces for the `` Snake Complex,'' a collection of three tricky fires that by Monday had charred 92,000 acres in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. Less than a week later, he was sent back to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, this time to oversee the North Fork fire, which twice threatened the Old Faithful geyser complex, burned across the <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and through <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>. Married 28 years, <PERSON> Poncin </PERSON>'s wife and two sons have grown accustomed to his being away from home summers. And his wife is quick to tell young women to steer their affections clear of firefighters, he said. `` I think she's gotten used to it,'' <PERSON> Poncin </PERSON> added, chuckling. `` It's hard on a wife and family. But it's a commitment they make.'' He realizes, too, that his family may not have to make that commitment for much longer. `` I hear the engines of a retirement plane warming up on the runway,'' <PERSON> Poncin </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineers say they can begin final testing of space shuttle Discovery's payload now that a $ 100 million spacecraft-tracking satellite has been loaded into the cargo bay. The tests are scheduled for the first two weeks of September and are intended to ensure the payload, nearly identical to one destroyed in the 1986 Challenger explosion, was installed properly, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Diller </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. One test will involve the launch control center in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and one will involve a ground-based tracking station at <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sands </LOCATION>, N.M. The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, designed to help ground controllers monitor shuttles and their payloads, is the principal cargo for the 26th space shuttle mission, scheduled for launch in late September or early October. Loading the satellite took 10 hours Monday and was completed with no significant problems, <PERSON> Diller </PERSON> said. Deployment of the satellite is set for the first day of the four-day Discovery mission. Payload engineers and technicians, wary of the potential of lightning from a tropical weather system that moved up the coast, had been working feverishly during the weekend to prepare for the satellite-loading. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, meanwhile, decided not to announce a date for the resumption of space shuttle flights until after a review Sept. 13-14, said spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kast </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had scheduled _ and postponed _ the launch five dates previously, beginning with July 15, 1987. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manned space program has been grounded since the January 1986 Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts.

<HEAD>Canine Virus Believed To Be Seal Killer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PIETERBUREN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A virus common in dogs has killed more than 11,000 seals in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s coastal waters this summer and humans can do little to stop the spread of the disease, a Dutch biologist says. Up to 80 percent of the seals in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kattegat </LOCATION> waters between <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> might die, <PERSON> Ab </PERSON> <PERSON> Osterhaus </PERSON> told a news conference Monday. `` Canine distemper virus, or a closely related virus, is the primary cause of the seal deaths,'' said <PERSON> Osterhaus </PERSON> in this northern Dutch village, which has <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest seal nursery. The virus causes infections of the respiratory and central nervous systems and the digestive tracts. <PERSON> Osterhaus </PERSON> said no specific cure exists for seals with the virus. Distemper may have spread to seals when one was bitten by a dog, said <PERSON> Osterhaus </PERSON>, who works for the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>. Specialists in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> who have been investigating the seal deaths have speculated that pollution has played a role in the killer epidemic. <PERSON> Osterhaus </PERSON> said research is still being conducted to determine if the massive pollution of Western European waters could have accelerated the epidemic by weakening seals' immune systems. `` We know that certain substances we find in the seas today ... can affect the immune system,'' he said. `` Pollution may have triggered the thing but it was not the cause as such.'' <PERSON> Osterhaus </PERSON> said antibodies to canine distemper virus were found in all of the dead seals he examined: `` The development of these antibodies coincided clearly with the surfacing of symptoms'' of the disease. A similar report was made at a news conference Monday in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, by patholigist <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s veterinary school. He said he began suspecting in June that the canine distemper virus was linked to the seal deaths. <PERSON> Bengt </PERSON> <PERSON> Klingeborn </PERSON>, a virologist at the veterinary school, said he believed the 25 percent of Western European seals that have survived so far will live through the epidemic because they have developed antibodies. <PERSON> Osterhaus </PERSON> noted that there had been an outbreak of the canine distemper virus among dogs in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> shortly before the epidemic broke out among seals early this year. Each summer, thousands of seals migrate from <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> to Western European waters. <PERSON> Osterhaus </PERSON> said his team had developed an experimental vaccine against the canine distemper virus but added `` it will not be possible to carry out preventive vaccinations in the wild.'' <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> has reported 3,400 dead seals, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> nearly 3,000, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> 3,900, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> 600 and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> 175.

<HEAD>4,000-Year-Old Funeral Boat Gently Moved into Elaborate Museum
Tomb Scene</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 4,000 years after it was built, the funeral boat of one of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s most powerful pharaohs takes another journey this week. The delicate, 32-foot long, wooden craft was gently lifted off the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> on Monday and rotated 180 degrees. Expert riggers who performed the tricky maneuver kept their hands off, fearing sweat or body oils would harm the ancient wood. Today, the boat used in the funeral of King Sen-wosret III in about 1850 B.C. will be moved inch by inch a few yards to its new setting in the museum _ a $ 2.2 million permanent exhibit. When the exhibit opens in November, it will allow visitors to walk through the eerie world of tombs, mummies, shrines to cat goddesses and other treasures from ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The museum said the exhibit would give visitors the only opportunity outside <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to enter and explore a life-size tomb complex. King Sen-wosret's boat _ a graceful, crescent-shaped canoe-like craft _ is but one of more than a thousand artifacts and treasures from the museum's collection used to recreate the burial scenes. Visitors enter the tomb chambers of the 5th Dynasty pharaoh, King Unis, dating to 2400 B.C. and excavated from <LOCATION> Saqqara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, in 1908. Beneath a false door, a 35-foot burial shaft takes visitors into the dark and eerie burial chamber. The sarcophagus is empty. When it was excavated, the pharaoh's mummy was gone, stolen by robbers or destroyed by time. Leaving the burial chamber, the visitor passes through a roughly hewn tomb robbers' tunnel and into another scene depicting a variety of Egyptian burial rites. `` This could well be the most fascinating part of the exhibit,'' said its developer, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamien </PERSON>. `` It gives them -LRB- visitors -RRB- a chance to explore the age-old mysteries of mummies and life after death.'' Next month, the museum staff will move 23 mummies into the exhibit, along with the accouterments their souls were to take with them to the afterworld. Sen-wosret's boat will be displayed nearby. No one actually knows if the boat was used to transport the king's body across the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to the burial site, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurco </PERSON>, a scholar on ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Oriental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and a consultant on the museum project. The boat was one of six found at the burial compound in 1893-94 by <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMorgan </PERSON>, a Welsh Egyptologist. Two badly deteriorated ones were left at the site. Two of the four DeMorgan saved are at the Egyptian Museum in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and the other is at the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Sen-wosret is remembered for military campaigns that extended <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s boundary into the Nubian region of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, as well as securing control of the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to the south, he said. He also centralized the Egyptian government, setting the pattern for several hundred years. Sen-wosret is believed to have died when he was about 50, said <PERSON> Yurco </PERSON>.

 Gangs of high school students are roving the industrial city of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, committing an increasing number of violent crimes, an official newspaper reported today. The Legal Daily -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fazhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ribao </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- said students have murdered, raped, robbed and are `` imitating feudal and underworld practices by forming illegal gangs.'' In another story, the paper called on the police to protect railway passengers from bands of teen-agers who raid trains and steal food and luggage. `` Let's deal with these little railroad guerrilla bands,'' the paper said. Although the report on <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> did not say how many crimes had been committed by the young hoodlums, it did say that 769 students were convicted of violent crimes last year, a 78.4 percent increase over 1986. The paper said the students took to a life of crime mainly because they did n't have sufficient political education. `` Some teachers these days are more willing to give three classes in math and literature than one class in political studies,'' the paper quoted one school principal as saying. The paper also said pornographic and violence-oriented literature and videocassettes were to blame for encouraging students to break the law. In addition, it said an increasing number of students are leaving school early to work. The paper said the dropouts exert a bad influence on their friends still in school. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is in the midst of economic reforms that are transforming the social stucture of the nation. Violent crime, especially robbery, and corruption have risen dramatically in the past few years. <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, because it is in the forefront of the reforms, is changing most rapidly. In the report on the `` railroad guerrillas,'' the paper related an incident that occurred on June 19 as a train entered a station in <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION> province. `` Several dozen youngster ran to the train and began walking by the windows, occasionally looking in,'' the report said. `` Just as the train began moving, these children shoved their hands in the windows and grabbed food, beer bottles, cans, luggage and then fled with the goods.'' Said the report: `` All the victims could do was curse.''

<TEXT>
 Share prices rose moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday, while the dollar inched up against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 299.81-point loser Monday, rebounded to close Tuesday's trading at 27,511.65. The market's main barometer erased marginal early losses and added 132.55 points or 0.48 percent. The dollar, which opened at 134.57 yen, closed at 134.39, up 0.19 yen from Monday's close of 134.20 yen. It ranged between 134.30 and 134.60 yen. Stock market participants were continuing to stay on the sidelines amid lackluster trading, according to an analyst with a major securities firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Because investors were still in a wait-and-see mood, trading was thin,'' he said on condition of anonymity. `` Any notable change is unlikely before the scheduled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report on employment figures Friday.'' He said investors were also acting cautiously ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to begin a new system of forward transactions. Press reports have said the new system will begin Sept. 3 and offer investors opportunities to earn profit with less risk.

<HEAD>Ohio Charges Companies With Violations Over Drought Insurance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and other insurance companies have been charged with violating <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law by overselling drought insurance policies to farmers, officials say. The charges, filed by <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabe </PERSON>, followed hearings on <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>'s marketing practices at which farmers, insurance agents and officials of <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> and other companies testified. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> also faces a class-action lawsuit by farmers in 10 states accusing it of reneging on its obligations to pay drought insurance claims. In addition, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> have scheduled hearings regarding the drought insurance in their states. `` The testimony gathered in the investigation shows that the companies involved failed to properly control the marketing of the insurance. As a result, there were numerous violations of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s insurance laws,'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rector </PERSON>, deputy director of the department, said Monday <PERSON> Fabe </PERSON> issued a 12-count order against <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, underwriter of the drought insurance. Other orders involving fewer counts were filed against <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>'s administrator, Good Weather International of <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; a Good Weather subsidiary, Good Weather Agriculture of <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Pio-Gard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, an insurance agency based in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Pio-Gard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pio-Gard </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> operation The order against <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> charges it with violating <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s Deceptive Practices Act It also charges the company with using unlicensed agents and failing to file proper insurance policy forms. A spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, headquarters said the company had not seen <PERSON> Fabe </PERSON>'s orders and would not comment on them until it has time to review them. Penalties the department may impose range from reprimands to suspending or revoking their licenses to operate in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and fines of up to $ 25,000. The companies have 30 days to request a hearing on the charges. While he said he did not believe the companies' actions were premeditated, <PERSON> Fabe </PERSON> said the insurance `` was not carefully designed and controlled,'' and was administered sloppily. During June, about 600 <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> farmers applied for the coverage, but <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> announced in July that agents had oversold the policies and began returning premium payments. <PERSON> Fabe </PERSON> said that even after the insurance was oversold, agents were at farmers' homes into the early morning hours selling policies. Rains that have fallen in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> since the hearings precluded many farmers from collecting on the policies, but <PERSON> Rector </PERSON> said that does not affect the department's investigation. `` Just because there's been no harm does n't mean there's no foul,'' he said. Two weeks ago, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> granted class-action status to lawsuits by farmers in 10 states against <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>. The action allows other farmers to join the lawsuit. The farmers involved live in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The farmers say <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> sold them drought insurance but failed to pay their claims for damage from this year's drought. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> has offered to repay farmers twice the amount they paid in premiums, but some state insurance regulators have termed the offer inadequate. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> has maintained its innocence. The company said it initially intended to underwrite $ 30 million in drought insurance nationwide, but that a last-minute flurry of applications this spring resulted in potential liabilities of more than $ 400 million. In recent weeks, the company took out full-page advertisements in newspapers around the country saying it has a longstanding reputation for business integrity.

 Military authorities said today that two army intelligence generals were arrested for alleged roles in a knife attack on a journalist critical of what he called military dominance in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Two brigadier generals _ <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyu-hong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kwon </PERSON> Ki-dae _ from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> were imprisoned and charged with instigating the Aug. 7 attack on Oh Hong-kun, city editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Joong-Ang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, according to military officials. A major and three non-commissioned officers of the intelligence command also were arrested for allegedly slashing Oh's thigh with knives. The four soldiers admitted to attacking Oh in retaliation for articles he wrote criticizing the military as blocking democratic development, according to military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They said several other intelligence officers have been questioned to determine whether they were involved. Those questioned included Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jin-baek </PERSON>, who headed the intelligence command, according to the officials. The military at first denied soldiers were involved in the attack, but pressure from the opposition forced the government to order an investigation. The opposition has demanded that all military personnel linked to the case be punished, saying it indicates a hard-line trend against dissent among government officials and the army.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has extended a five-month cease-fire with Nicaraguan rebels until the end of September and called for new talks on a Central American peace plan. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s extension on Monday was the fourth of a formal 60-day truce that took effect April 1. The U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, said in June they would observe the cease-fire indefinitely. In a speech to a group of Indian leaders in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the extension was issued `` so the rebels can put down their arms and accept amnesty.'' The rebels and the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government first agreed to a cease-fire on March 21. Two days later they signed a pact agreeing to negotiate an end to the the 7-year-old war. Both sides have accused the other of violating the truce. A series of political talks to negotiate a permanent cease-fire and pave the way for a peace settlement broke off June 9. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also called on the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to resume talks on a Central American peace plan. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the four other presidents last met in January.

Predictably, vice-presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> came in for a few jabs: `` looks like a hawk, runs like a chicken.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, 51, wore a blue sweater with white stars and red stripes _ reminding the audience of his arrest for wearing similar garb in the'60s _ then stripped to a `` Just Say No'' T-shirt. In addition to politics and protest, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s topics of choice were drugs, sex and religion. Straightforward jokes were rare, and rambling stories and observations the norm.

<HEAD>Study: Drug Use By Pregnant Women Causing New Generation Of
Addicts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An alarming number of babies were exposed to drugs in the womb, according to researchers who found the problem not confined to inner-cities and warned that a `` generation of innocent addicts'' was being created. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perinatal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Addiction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> found that at least 11 percent of women in 36 hospitals had used illegal drugs during pregnancy. The hospitals were chosen to represent institutions of varying sizes with patients from varied socio-economic levels, said Dr. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chasnoff </PERSON>, who directed the survey. The study, financed by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Substance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> March </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dimes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, showed the incidence of substance abuse among the hospitals surveyed ranged from four-tenths of 1 percent to 27 percent of pregnant patients. <PERSON> Chasnoff </PERSON> said Monday the differences often reflected how carefully the hospitals looked for the problem, with those hospitals with an established system of determining drug abuse among pregnant women finding considerably more instances. Substances in the survey included cocaine, marijuana, heroin and methadone, amphetamines and the hallucinogen phencyclidine, or PCP. <PERSON> Chasnoff </PERSON> said the high rate of pregnancies or births in which drugs are present is not confined to the largest urban areas but is similar in hospitals across the nation. He also said damage to the baby from the drugs could include prenatal strokes, lasting brain damage, seizures after birth, premature birth, retarded fetal growth, breathing lapses, absence of part of the intestines or structural abnormalities in genital and urinary organs. The illegal drug use in pregnancy `` cuts across racial and socio-economic lines and maternal age groups, especially since cocaine has become so popular,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Substance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not just a minority problem and it's not just an inner-city problem,'' she said. `` We are producing a new generation of innocent addicts.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar inched up against most foreign currencies in early European trading today, but exchange dealers predicted gains would be limited by fears of central bank intervention and a lack of market-affecting news. Gold prices fell. `` After last week's activity, this is going to be a week of consolidation,'' said <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, treasury economist at <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Recording Reveals Joking, No Snowfall Discussion Prior To Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A `` black box'' tape recording from an ill-fated <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight shows the pilots joked about a flight attendant's dating habits but failed to discuss the falling snow before the jet crashed, killing 28 people, a newspaper reported. In the nearly three minutes of pilot conversation omitted from a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> transcript released earlier, discussion between the pilot and co-pilot centered around whether a woman flight attendant dated pilots, the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. There was no discussion about de-icing the jet or of the snow falling at <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in the minutes before the Nov. 15, 1987, crash, the newspaper said. The Union of Flight Attendants has filed a statement with the transportation board, saying the tape shows the pilots discussing `` unnecessary and unprofessional topics.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said Monday the black-box recording shows the pilots operated a `` highly skilled, well-disciplined, professional cockpit.'' <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, he added, agreed with the transportation board that the unreleased section of tape was not pertinent to the accident investigation. The fact that the pilots did n't comment on the snow indicates they did n't feel it was a problem, <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said. `` What it means is that they were human beings who had some conversations,'' he said. `` But at no point did they neglect their duties. ... Pilots are n't robots.'' Transportation officials are investigating the possibility that the DC-9's wings were not adequately de-iced prior to takeoff. The board also is studying the experience level of the pilots, who both died in the crash, and turbulence from a plane landing on the next runway as possible causes of the crash. The recording shows the plane taxied into position near the end of the runway and was prepared to take off at 2:05 p.m. In the minutes that followed, there was confusion in the <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> control tower about the identity of Flight 1713, and the tower cleared another plane to take off first. In the conversation between pilots that followed, the newspaper said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Zvonek </PERSON>, the 43-year-old captain, mentioned a flight attendant. `` She said she does n't date pilots,'' <PERSON> Zvonek </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` She does n't go for one-night stands.'' Co-pilot <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON>, 26, reportedly asked, `` How come she does n't date pilots? Is it the same reason why I do n't date flight attendants? ... -LRB- laughter -RRB- `` She seems real nice.'' Minutes later, Flight 1713 was cleared for takeoff and began rolling down the runway. At 2:15 p.m., the plane climbed into the air. Ten seconds later, <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON> shouted an obscenity. The DC-9 flipped and crashed.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told attorneys they did n't know where <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s money came from or how its finances were managed when they led the television ministry, documents filed with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court show. In depositions filed Monday with the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> court, the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> said top aides handled most of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s money matters. Asked about six-figure bonuses given her, Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said, `` I just know they -LRB- board members -RRB- put them in my account, and I spent them like a typical woman.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who repeatedly said he did not recall seeing various memos about <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s finances, was asked if he thought aides did not properly inform him. He replied, `` I was exhausted half the time and reading memos at 11 or 12 -LRB- o'clock -RRB- before dropping off to sleep, and I could have been informed and would not even know it, I would have been so tired.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> claims Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s annual salaries during her last four years at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> were $ 84,964 in 1983-84, $ 142,586 in 1984-85, and $ 90,736 in both 1985-86 and 1986-87. During that period she also received bonuses totaling $ 825,000, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> records show. PTL records show that during those years <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, as <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s leader, received nearly $ 8.3 million in salary, bonuses and other perks The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' comments were contained in 814 pages of depositions taken under oath for a Sept. 12 trial in which <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> attorneys will try to recover $ 52 million in ministry assets from the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and former top aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> claims they grossly mismanaged the ministry and took millions of dollars from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> for their personal use. The Bakkers are suing <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.8 million for equity in the parsonage they once occupied. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> is suing for $ 185,000, a year's salary. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said she was unaware that she and her husband are suing <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.8 million. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who was cohost of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> Show'' and had her own program called `` <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' said in the deposition that she did n't know how many bonuses <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s board gave her and did n't recall the amounts of the bonuses. `` I would go to them and tell them they did n't need to do that,'' she said, `` and they would always tell me, ` Well, you're worth more than that to us and we wish it could be more.' Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said she and her husband were always careful to use their money _ not <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s _ to pay personal bills. She also said she and her husband `` have always been very, very open with the Internal Revenue A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, is investigating whether <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his top aides committed tax, wire or mail fraud. That probe focuses on how <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, under <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, raised and spent millions of dollars in contributions. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned as <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> president in March 1987 after acknowledging a sexual encounter with former church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> in 1980. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> would not say when she learned of her husband's encounter with <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> `` I do n't think it has anything to do with the case,'' she said. Asked about a $ 10,000 expenditure of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> funds for security at a <LOCATION> Gatlinburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, residence he once occupied, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he and his family had received threats. `` A man came several years ago to murder my daughter and rape her, and he is in a mental institution,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Fugitive Financial Planner Charged With Embezzlement, Mail Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fugitive financial planner who sent notes of apology to his clients after he allegedly stole $ 25 million of their funds has been charged with embezzlement and mail fraud. Complaints filed Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allege that <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON>, 52, masterminded a 10-year scheme that may have swindled nearly 50 investors, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>. Authorities do not know where <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> is hiding, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. He did not reveal his location in telephone calls to his wife and her attorney. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> is accused of illegally transferring clients' money to a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> bank account since 1978 and issuing false statements indicating investments in money-market funds and certificates of deposit, said a statement by <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. The federal complaints cite five counts of embezzlement and two counts of mail fraud, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said, adding other charges were possible. The case could be brought before a federal grand jury next month, he said. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> faces 35 years in prison and fines in excess of $ 1.5 million if convicted on all counts, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> had a `` longstanding pattern of embezzlement'' from about 25 professional associations handling pension funds and other assets for members, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON>'s scheme could have affected nearly 50 investors, ranging from prominent <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> doctors and smaller investors such as clerks and nurses. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> sent hand-written notes of apology to his clients Aug. 10 when he dropped out of sight. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrence </PERSON>, assistant special agent for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, said most of the clients' losses were not insured. <PERSON> Torrence </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> is the only defendant in the case, but `` that could change'' as the probe continues.

<HEAD>China Tests Boeing Helicopter In Tibet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is interested in buying at least a dozen <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> helicopters that would be used in developing a rapid deployment force, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military official said today. He said Chinese officers recently tested a Chinook CH-47D helicopter on the Tibetan plateau at more than 15,000 feet high. A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, where the company's helicopter division is based, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> rented a C-5 cargo plane from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to ship the helicopter to <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in early August `` The Chinese interest is very encouraging,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Togerson </PERSON>. `` The helicopter met or surpassed their specifications.'' The spokesman for the prospective purchaser, <ORGANIZATION> Poly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which handles weapons deals for the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would decide in September whether to buy the helicopters. He said the military had so far only considered the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> model. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said the helicopters sell for about $ 15 million each. `` If completed it would be one of the largest direct sales of military goods between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The largest U.S.-China military contract was signed in August 1987 with <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Bethpage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and is worth $ 245 million. The avionics firm contracted to upgrade the electronics system of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s F-8 fighter jet. The Chinese military spokesman, who identified himself only as <PERSON> Kang </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would use the helicopters for military purposes `` inside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' He said the copters were being considered as part of a program to develop a rapid deployment force for the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said the Chinese also could use the helicopters to add an airborne wing to their army. The CH-47D is the latest version of the CH-47, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s primary medium-lift helicopter <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> says that its main use is for rapid deployment of tactical units in combat. The helicopter can carry up to 44 combat-equipped soldiers and has a top speed of 174 mph and a cruising speed of 161 mph. <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> said the helicopter tests in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> had nothing to do with recent unrest in the area. <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> activists rioted in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> last autumn and again in March. More than 30 Tibetans and Chinese police were killed. A Western military analyst in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said he did not think the helicopters, if purchased, would be used to quell domestic unrest. `` The Chinese traditionally test helicopters for high-altitude. Over one-third of the country is mountainous,'' he said. Before buying 24 medium-sized Blackhawk helicopters from the American firm <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> several years ago, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also tested them in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, he said. Western military analysts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the prospective purchase would be consistent with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military reforms designed to create a more professional army. The analysts pointed to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s poor showing in its brief war with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as an example of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s need to modernize its military. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has shifted its military focus from preparedness for all-out war to training for limited conflicts. `` These types of conflicts need a speedy response,'' said one diplomat. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> helicopters could be useful.'' In June, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> announced the formation of the `` First Platoon'' _ an airborne force trained in rapid response techniques. Today's official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported several military regions recently completed exercises in north and south <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to upgrade their ability to respond rapidly to `` local conflict.''

<HEAD>Mother Ordered To Practice Birth Control Is Pregnant, Lawyer Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A teen-age mother of three ordered by a judge to practice birth control for the rest of her child-bearing years after she abandoned her sons for three days is expecting another child, her attorney said. Debra <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>, 18, was sentenced by Judge <PERSON> Linsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> in May to lifetime probation and ordered to use birth control after pleading guilty to two counts of attempted child abuse. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> was charged after she left her sons, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, then 18 months old, and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, then 6 months old, alone for three days in a <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> apartment in May 1987. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, a deputy public defender representing Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>, said Monday that Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s pregnancy was confirmed early last week when she went to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for a pregnancy test. The baby is due in April, he said. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> refused to say whether <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> was practicing any form of birth control when she became pregnant. He asked Ms. <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> whether abortion is a form of birth control and whether Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> should obtain one to abide by the terms of her probation. The judge said that she `` would never make such a ruling.'' Ms. <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> also said that because no birth-control device is `` 100 percent foolproof,'' she will not revoke <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s lifetime probation. `` I'm not going to send her to prison because she is pregnant,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> had a third child, a daughter, while awaiting trial this year. The girl has since been adopted, according to court records. The two boys were placed in foster homes and court records show that Ms. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> signed papers allowing the children to be offered for adoption.

<TEXT>
 A car bomb exploded today in the Syrian-policed market town of <LOCATION> Chtoura </LOCATION>. Police said six people were wounded. A police spokesman said a white <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> blew up at around 1 p.m. near a bank on the main street of the town in eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The blast damaged parked cars, setting several on fire, and shattered windows in nearby buildings. The spokesman, who can not be identified under standing regulations, said ambulances and fire engines went to the scene. Syrian troops sealed off the blast area. The car bomb was the 12th in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. By police count, 103 people have been killed and 371 wounded in the bombings. As with the earlier bombings this year, there was no claim of responsibility for today's explosion. The highway where the bomb exploded links the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and is the main route used by the Syrian army to supply its forces in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, maintains about 40,000 troops in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as well as west and south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The Syrians have been at odds with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christians since President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, scuttled a Syrian-brokered December 1985 treaty between Christians and Moslems to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 13-year-old civil war. Christian anger has mounted following <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s support for one of its <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> allies, former President <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s presidential contest. Right-wing militants of the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, oppose <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> Syrian-backed Moslem factions have accused the militia of forcibly preventing Christian legislators from attending an Aug. 18 parliamentary session where a president was to have been elected. Only 38 of the 76 deputies turned up. Because that was not enough for a quorum, the election was postponed. No new date has been set. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term expires Sept. 23.

 A <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> neurosurgeon and convicted slumlord who ignored needed repairs to his vermin-infested buildings has agreed to pay 70 tenants as much as $ 35,000 apiece under a record settlement, lawyers said. The $ 2.5 million settlement was announced Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> attorneys <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Litt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodaken </PERSON>, who brought the suit against Dr. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Avol </PERSON>, 65. Avol, once described by a prosecutor as `` the most recalcitrant slumlord in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' previously was sentenced to house arrest in his own rat-infested building. He served 30 days. He also served 55 days of a nine-month jail sentence, a term that began Christmas Eve. Tenants accused Avol of cutting off water, failing to make needed repairs, allowing buildings to become infested with rats and bugs, and attempting to evict the tenants who complained to authorities. Payments averaging from $ 30,000 to $ 35,000 will be made to 70 families comprising 319 adults and children who lived in two of Avol's downtown South Main Street buldings, <PERSON> Litt </PERSON> said. `` We hope it will give a clear signal to those who run buildings in dilapidated conditions that it will cost them a great deal of money to do so, and it's in their own best economic interest to clean up the buildings,'' <PERSON> Litt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hittelman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Avol </PERSON>'s attorney, said the settlement did not mean his client was admitting liability. Also named as defendants were <PERSON> Avol </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Hyoung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sook </PERSON> <PERSON> Pak </PERSON>, who bought the building from <LOCATION> Avol </LOCATION> in 1986. The Paks will pay about 10 percent of the settlement costs. The buildings are now owned by <ORGANIZATION> Anthony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barras </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which has agreed to make complete repairs.

<HEAD>Infiltration Attempt Foiled, Four Arabs Wounded</HEAD>

 Lebanese Christian villagers joined by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops today blocked a guerrilla squad trying to infiltrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and at least one guerrilla was wounded, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. It was the first time <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has reported that Lebanese villagers helped thwart a border crossing. The infiltration attempt was the 17th since the Palestinian uprising broke out in Israeli-occupied territories almost nine months ago. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Palestinians went on strike to protest the planned deportation of 25 fellow Arabs. Israeli troops shot and wounded four Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> during a protest, hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the report. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the attempted infiltration today occurred near the village of <LOCATION> Khalata </LOCATION>, about 2 -LCB- miles north of the Israeli border. It said a villager spotted the guerrilla squad walking out of a ravine and moving across a field near the village. The villagers alerted others and 10 Lebanese men armed themselves and stopped the squad, it said. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, speaking on the radio, said the Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> initially encountered the guerrillas. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IDF </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Forces -RRB- soldiers joined them,'' he said. `` To the best of my knowledge, there were no people wounded on our side.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ended a three-year occupation of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in the summer of 1985, but maintains about 1,000 soldiers in a self-declared security zone to back up the mostly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. In other developments, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> turned down two appeals by <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, head of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, to open his court hearings to the public and to make secret prosecution documents available to his attorneys. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, whose case is currently before the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>, is being held for the third time under emergency regulations which permit detention for up to six months without trial. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> either to release <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> or bring him to trial. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> is a key <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader in the occupied territories. At the Jneid Prison near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, a military appeals board today began a closed hearing on the appeals of 15 Palestinians slated for deportation. Another 10 face deportation orders. Thirty-three Arabs have been expelled since the `` intefadah,'' or uprising, began. During that time 255 Palestinian have been killed, most of them by army gunfire. Four Israelis also have died. Curfews were in effect today on the Jabaliya, Bureij and Nusseirat refugee camps in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. A military spokesman said the curfews were `` preventive measures'' because previous general strikes _ a main tactic of resistance _ had triggered violent protests in the camps. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the largest city in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> with over 100,000 residents, the army lifted a five-day curfew but streets remained deserted because of the general strike. Outlawed Palestinian flags flew from the city's largest mosque and others were draped on electricity poles. Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, meanwhile, complained angrily after police confiscated a handgun from a settler at <LOCATION> Kedummim </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The settler, <PERSON> Eliezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Shochat </PERSON>, fired in the direction of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> youths who stoned his car Sunday in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported <PERSON> Shochat </PERSON> may have hit two Palestinians and said police were investigating.

 A homeless man who barricaded himself in a historic 19th-century fort and threatened to blow it up had enough provisions to last two weeks but surrendered after about seven hours. While police and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents surrounded <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> on Monday, the man used black powder to fire several apparently harmless shots from replicas of cannons inside the reconstructed log fort. No one was injured. The man, who identified himself as <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, 40, surrendered in exchange for an opportunity to talk to reporters. The former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans need their own program, run by other veterans, to overcome unique emotional and psychological problems. `` Veterans in this country paid their dues.

<TEXT>
 A reputed member of the Gambino crime family who reportedly served as a government informant for years was killed outside his <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> home. `` I think his days were numbered from the day'' his informer status was made public in March 1985, said a federal source who spoke on the condition his identity not be revealed. The victim, <PERSON> Wilfred </PERSON> -LRB- `` Willie Boy'' -RRB- <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, was a co-defendant in a racketeering trial at which he and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, reputed head of the <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> family, were acquitted in April 1987. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent testified in court that <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>'s faction had put out a murder contract on <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 53, was shot several times, including in the back of the head, with a .380 - caliber automatic shortly after 6 a.m. Monday, said Detective <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Llanes </PERSON>, a police Several spent shells were found between <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s home and his car, which was parked a block away. `` I do n't think there was any doubt that it was Gotti-sanctioned,'' said the source. `` One bullet in the head would have done the job, the 13 other ones were meant as a message.'' The government said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, whose criminal record dated to 1952, had been jailed for 18 months before the trial for his own safety because he had been on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> payroll from 1966 to 1974 and then resumed working as an unpaid snitch in 1980. A prosecutor said in court papers that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had passed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> details of the Gambino family hierarchy and its activities in gambling, loansharking, hijacking and murder. But his lawyer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehbock </PERSON>, denied that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was ever an informant and said he was denied bail in an unsuccessful government attempt to make him cooperate and discredit him with his co-defendants. Prosecutors offered <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> a place in the federal witness protection program before his informer status was revealed, but <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> refused, saying he would never testify against his associates, according to court documents.

 Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> says he learned to direct his first feature film the way he learned everything else: just doing it. `` You can study things until they're over the hill _ read a lot of books, see a lot of films,'' <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> says in the September issue of <LOCATION> Vogue </LOCATION>. `` But the only way to learn something is simply to do it.

 A Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> bishop met today with <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, spiritual leader of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Sunni Moslems, as part of an effort to free foreigners held captive by Moslem extremists. The Right Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, bishop of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, arrived in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Sunday seeking word on the fate of four missing Iranians. He had been in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> earlier this month. Iranians leaders have said they will use their influence with Shiite Moslems holding hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to free their captives if the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> helps determine what happened to the Iranians, who disappeared in Christian Lebanese territory six years ago. Four Britons are missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, along with nine Americans, an Indian, an Italian, a West German and two unidentified foreigners. Most are believed held by Shiite groups. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who is based in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said he was very optimistic about the progress of his discussions in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` It's just a feeling, but we're optimistic,'' he told reporters after a 45-minute meeting with <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> declined to elaborate. It was <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s second visit to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in a month as representative of Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, primate of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The Iranians disappeared while driving in the Christian heartland north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after the Israeli army invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in June 1982. They were presumed to have been kidnapped, but there was no claim of responsibility. There have been unconfirmed reports they were killed. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was asked if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would keep its promise to help free the foreign hostages if he received confirmation the four Iranians are dead. `` I simply do n't know what effect it will have on the government because I'm not a government man. I'm a churchman,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> replied. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who speaks Arabic, also sought word on the Iranians' fate Sunday when he met with <PERSON> Mar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, spiritual head of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he had some leads, but declined to give any details.

 The 10-year-old daughter of a couple presumed killed by security forces during <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s `` dirty war'' was ordered taken from her natural grandparents and returned to her adoptive parents Federal Judge <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanudo </PERSON>, who handed down the decision, `` does n't deserve to live,'' said <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON>'s maternal grandfather. <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON> vowed to appeal the order, issued Monday in a closed-door hearing in the <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> suburb of Moron. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON> adopted the dark, chubby-cheeked <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> after she was found as an infant in the doorway of a building and taken to an orphanage. They did not comment on the ruling to reporters outside the courtroom. The `` Juliana Case,'' as it is called in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, is reminiscent of `` The Official Story,'' the Oscar-winning 1985 Argentine film about a family that adopts the child of a woman killed by security forces. In the 1970s, at least 9,000 people vanished in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and were presumed abducted and killed by security agents in the `` dirty war,'' which was ordered by the military dictatorship to quell the leftist opposition. Several military leaders have been tried, convicted and sentenced for their role in the terror. The <ORGANIZATION> Trevinos </ORGANIZATION> _ unlike other families who did n't question where their children came from _ adopted <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> legally, told her she was adopted, and tried for years to track down her biological parents. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON>, a journalist, recently told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` From the first moment, we told <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> she was adopted ... If her real parents appeared, my wife and I told ourselves we would rip up the documents'' and return the child. The <ORGANIZATION> Trevinos </ORGANIZATION> brought <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> to the attention of her natural grandparents earlier this year, when they gave a sample of her blood to a clinic set up to match children with parents who had `` disappeared.'' The blood sample proved <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> was the daughter of <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON> and <PERSON> Liliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON> _ who was pregnant when the couple was arrested on July 1, 1977 _ and the granddaughter of <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON>. On June 23, the day the <ORGANIZATION> Trevinos </ORGANIZATION> received the news from the blood bank, they were ordered to appear in court. Former Federal Judge <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> gave them two choices: return <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> to her grandparents, or give her to a foster home. The <ORGANIZATION> Trevinos </ORGANIZATION> chose the former, but filed an appeal arguing that they had followed the legal requirements to adopt <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> and were better suited to care for her than the grandparents. <PERSON> Sanudo </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> after the latter retired, overturned his predecessor's ruling. The military, which staged a 1976 coup, turned over power to elected civilian President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> in 1983.

<HEAD>Government Appeals For End of Rail Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEIN WIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and the public today to help end a five-day-old railway strike that has paralyzed transportation nationwide. `` The stoppage of rail service, which is the cheapest mode of transportation, has caused hardship to the people and also caused the price of food to spiral,'' state-run <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio said. `` The government, therefore, appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and the public to help solve the rail transportation problem,'' the brief broadcast said. Monks are an influential element of Burmese society. They and activist students have been in the vanguard of mass pro-democracy demonstrations that began July 23 when 77-year-old Ne Win resigned after 26 years of authoritarian rule and was replaced by hardliner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>. The nation's railroad workers went on strike last Friday, shutting down the most affordable form of long-distance transportation and making it difficult to move food into the cities. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> suspended all domestic and international operations, and bus service was severely reduced. Private buses have since raised their fares from 8 to 50. Strikes also closed oil refineries in <LOCATION> Syriam </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Mann </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, crippled most factories of the <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and left foreign ships waiting at <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> port, officials said. Gasoline became scarce and its price soared. With most gas stations closed, the black market price rose from about $ 4.17 to $ 16.67 per gallon. That sent people running to buy bicycles, which were selling today at 15 percent above their normal price. Bicycles imported from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sell for about $ 600 - $ 700 in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> Those produced at government-run factories sell for about $ 133 but are in short supply, and today the black market price jumped to $ 416. As part of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s continuing turmoil, student leaders on Sunday announced the formation of a student union. On Monday, dock workers said they too had formed a union and 21 elder statesmen announced formation of a <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. After Ne Win led the 1962 military coup that ended <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s experiment with democracy, he outlawed all political parties, unions and associations except for the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> The unions and the new <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> are illegal under <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s present constitution. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s leadership disintegrated following the Aug. 19 announcement that civilian lawyer <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> had replaced the hated <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> as president and head of the sole political party. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s promise of a referendum Sept. 12 that would pave the way for democracy did not quiet the demonstrations, in which hundreds of people have died in the past month. Reports reaching <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> Monday said the governments of at least eight cities have stopped operating and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, residents and some striking policemen have organized protection of their neighborhoods. The reports said many offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were closed, while some were destroyed by protesters. The cities included <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, Sagaing, <LOCATION> Monywa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Minbu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Magwe </PERSON> in northern <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taunggyi </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Shan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bassein </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Irrawaddy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today countered <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s criticism of him on defense issues and said the next president ca n't have it all if he's serious about erasing the federal deficit. The Democratic nominee also hinted he was approaching the point at which he would respond more aggressively to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> attacks, saying it would be `` unfortunate'' but necessary to reshape the election debate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meeting with western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> editors on the final day of a two-day visit to the region, fired back quickly when asked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assertions that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would endanger national security because of his foreign policy inexperience. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he wants them all,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said after listing his opposition to building MX missiles on railroad cars, two new supercarrier task forces and deploying the Star Wars space defense system. `` You ca n't have them all,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Not if you're serious about providing the resources our conventional forces need and not if you're serious about getting that deficit down. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has been trying to dispel talk that his campaign has stagnated, has blamed such talk on the media attention given to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, following the Republican convention and to reports about unsubstantiated rumors about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his wife. `` If it continues you have to respond,'' he said. `` I think that's unfortunate but I think it's very clear what kind of a campaign the Republicans are running and I think we're going to have to deal with it.'' For <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, Monday was a bizarre day in which he first canceled a news conference after aides complained network television was ignoring his speeches but later met with reporters armed with questions about whether his campaign was in a state of confusion. `` Back by popular demand,'' he joked as he walked into a rescheduled news conference. The confusion comes at a time when many Democratic strategists inside and outside the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign are concerned that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has allowed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to seize control of the debate with attacks on the Democrat's patriotism, views on defense and gun control and the furlough program. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters he was `` trying to get this campaign up where it belongs'' by discussing his economic positions. He came to western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to highlight that region's economic resurgence. The governor said face-to-face debates were the best place to respond to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks but then offered a preview by countering the vice president's attacks on the furlough program, which until amended last year extended eligibility to first-degree murderers. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he wanted to ask <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about the 16,000 furloughs granted to federal prisoners last year, `` some lasting 45 days and many to convicted drug pushers Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he wants to execute.'' In a speech before the news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support for a reduction in the capital gains tax. `` We're not going to accept Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s suggestion that the way to build opportunity for our citizens is to cut taxes for the wealthy again, this time with a $ 40 billion handout, 70 percent of which would go to those making $ 200,000 a year or more,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also called for an end to questions about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military and academic records in favor of issues-related media coverage `` Let's put the last few weeks behind us,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The dog days of August are almost over. The curtain is going up on the greatest exercise of political freedom the world has ever known.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said time was too short to engage in personal attacks. `` Ten weeks from tomorrow, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will choose a new president,'' he said. `` The campaign is a golden and historic moment to define our nation's future. My friends, let us not waste this opportunity. `` Because the issue in this campaign is not how well Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did one night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> or how well I did one night in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` The issue is not whose speechwriter should get an Emmy. The issue is whose values should get into the White House. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are n't interested in the grades that some of us might have gotten while we were in college; they care about whether their children will have the chance to go to college.''

 A fuming mad <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> says he's `` going to go after'' two part-time actors who say they fibbed their way onto his and other popular TV talk shows by pretending to have undergone sex therapy. <PERSON> Tani </PERSON> <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON>, 37, and <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 33, both of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said they acted the roles of people with sexual problems because they wanted to experience the thrill of appearing on millions of television screens from coast to coast. In addition to the `` Geraldo'' show, both appeared on `` <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>,'' while Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> appeared on the `` <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> Show.'' Appearing this morning on `` CBS This Morning,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said the only time he was a little scared during the talk-show stints was during a `` <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>,'' when the host told the audience that he and Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> were not actors reproducing a scene. `` There was a little clenching in the stomachs ... but we've both been performers all our adult lives,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said `` After you go through the first one, they get really easy,'' Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said he is considering legal action. `` These people are admitting now to having committed fraud or at least misrepresentation ... and we're going to go after them,'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said Monday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` This is something that goes right to the integrity of the broadcast itself. I'm really spitting mad.'' However, a psychologist who recommended the pair as guests maintained they were n't acting. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said he played a 35-year-old virgin on a Rivera show in July and an impotent husband on a `` <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> Show'' televised in May. In both cases, he said he claimed to be undergoing therapy with a sex surrogate, in which a patient has sex with a stand-in chosen by the therapist. `` Geraldo tapes at a little studio on 42nd and Broadway, so now I can say I've appeared on Broadway,'' said the part-time actor who also cares for an elderly man. Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> said she appeared with <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and played the role of his sex surrogate on `` Geraldo,'' and appeared on a `` <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> Show'' taped in April. `` It was the idea of going on national television _ from a performer's standpoint that's pretty big,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON>, a full-time secretary and part-time actress. She said her favorite role was on a November 1986 `` Oprah Winfrey Show'' in which she pretended to be a sex-hating woman who had been married 14 years. During the taping, according to Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> came backstage and said, `` ` I know this is going to be a great show. ... Just be honest,' and I died a thousand times.'' Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said they were asked to appear on the shows by a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> psychologist-author, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dauw </PERSON>, for whom Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> was working as an office manager. `` He asked me to do it because the surrogates he does have working for him are neither presentable or articulate enough'' to go on television, Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dauw </PERSON>, who had appeared on some of the shows to promote his books, is frequently asked to suggest guests who can give personal accounts of sex therapy, said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnell </PERSON>, a producer for the `` <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>,'' taped in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` We try to check people's stories out as much as possible, but when you have a professional you've worked with before, there's no reason to doubt that professional,'' Ms. <PERSON> Finnell </PERSON> said. `` We take every precaution to ensure a person's credibility,'' said <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> DiMaio </PERSON>, executive producer of Ms. <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>'s show. <PERSON> Dauw </PERSON> did not return numerous messages left Sunday and Monday on his business telephone answering machine and a woman who answered the telephone at his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> home said he was in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. She refused to give her name or release a telephone number where he could be reached. Earlier, <PERSON> Dauw </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION> that Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> worked as an office manager and a sex surrogate and <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> was his client. `` They did n't play -LRB- act -RRB- anything,'' <PERSON> Dauw </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said today it is trying to locate and prosecute a pilot who buzzed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 30th birthday concert in the northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> industrial city of <LOCATION> Leeds </LOCATION> The airplane swooped less than 200 feet over the heads of the 90,000 fans at <LOCATION> Roundhay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> on Monday night, the authority said. `` Magistrates and courts take low-flying offenses very seriously, and so do we,'' said a spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. `` It is our firm policy to prosecute.'' Under <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> rules, it is an offense for a pilot to fly below 3,000 feet over an event with more than 1,000 spectators without permission. Concert fans said they could read the twin-engine light aircraft's registration number, and police have passed it on to the aviation authority. `` It was sufficiently low for us to be concerned and report him,'' said a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, also speaking of condition of anonymity. `` It is being considered as a potential hazard.'' The pilot, if convicted, could face stiff fines and permanent loss of his pilot's license. The audience sang `` Happy Birthday'' to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> during the concert. A spokesman for the singer said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> Jehovah </ORGANIZATION>'s Witness and they do not celebrate birthdays, so there was no fanfare, gifts, cake or party planned

 Twenty-nine people arrested while trying to give food to homeless people in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> chanted `` arrest hunger, not free food'' as police led them away. Police cited the activists for illegal distribution of food, demonstrating and leafleting without a permit and creating a public nuisance. `` By sending the police here, the mayor's saying it's illegal to feed people,'' said <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedgecoke </PERSON>, an organizer for a group called `` All Peoples <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The arrests were made Monday after about 100 members of the group called `` Food Not Bombs'' marched through the <LOCATION> Haight-Ashbury </LOCATION> district to the park, carrying boxes of food, chanting slogans and banging pots and pans. When they reached the corner of the park just before noon, the members began to set up two tables with plates of beans, melons and other food. About 50 police officers, half clad in riot gear, surrounded the group and arrested members after issuing a warning. `` We do n't want to have a confrontation,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON>, spokesman for Food Not Bombs. `` We have been doing this for eight years in other cities.'' <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON>, who was also arrested, said his group supported diverting funds for military arms to humanitarian causes. `` Our political message is that money should be spent on food and housing,'' he said. The city had warned group members they would be arrested if they attempted to give away food in the park, something they had done for several months. The group said the police crackdown was the result of complaints from local businesses. One resident who watched the arrests said she was disgusted by the police action. `` As a citizen of the city, I was offended that this was going on in my neighborhood,'' said <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antenore </PERSON>, a teacher and 12-year resident of the neighborhood. `` I was shocked by the attitude and the riot gear.'' The mayor's office did not return telephone calls for comment.

<HEAD>Polisario, Morocco Agree Conditionally To U.N. Peace Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and the Polisario guerrillas said today they had agreed conditionally to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan aimed at ending their 13-year conflict in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said both sides `` accepted with remarks and comments'' the Aug. 11 peace plan for a cease-fire and a U.N.-monitored referendum in the phosphate-rich desert territory. The text of the proposal has not been made public. The Marxist-led Polisario has fought for <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>'s independence since 1975, when <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s colonial forces gave up the northwest African territory and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> annexed it <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has backed Polisario's campaign, but <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> restored diplomatic relations in May after years of tension verging on war over the territory. In <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spain </ORGANIZATION> that he viewed as `` very good news'' the announcement. `` We expect this process to lead to the establishment of peace and prosperity in this region of great importance to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>,'' the minister said. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> expects to begin a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping operation in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> before the end of the year. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is considering sending about 2,000 peacekeeping troops to the remote, sparsely populated territory, authorities say. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> will also be appointing a special representative to supervise the peace process, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> told reporters. `` Through the two replies, the conflict in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> enters a new phase, with difficulties still to be settled,'' Polisario delegation leader <PERSON> Bechir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustapha </PERSON> said. `` We have accepted with certain conditions,'' <PERSON> Mustapha </PERSON> added. Moroccan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdellatif </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Falali </PERSON> said there `` is an accord in principle to work together with the secretary-general for the implementation of his proposals.'' `` A referendum can be held in the relatively near future,'' the foreign minister said. Announcement of the tentative agreement followed last-minute meetings between <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and the two sides. Their deadline for submitting responses to the peace plan was Thursday. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s detailed proposals included a cease-fire and a referendum calling for the region's independence or affiliation with another nation, most likely <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> covers about 110,000 square miles but had only about 76,000 inhabitants in the last Spanish census in 1975. Most of its people have fled to Moroccan-held cities or to refugee camps around the Algerian oasis of <LOCATION> Tindouf </LOCATION>. The major remaining dispute now likely is to be over who has the right to vote in a referendum. Polisario claims about 165,000 Western Saharans live around the <LOCATION> Tindouf </LOCATION> oasis, but <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> says most of them are not Western Saharans. Polisario also claims that two-thirds of the 150,000 inhabitants of the Moroccan-held areas are immigrants not eligible to vote, but <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> claims 90 percent of them are Western Saharans. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s army has kept Polisario from major gains, mainly by building a series of defensive walls in the desert. But <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s war effort has been costing up to $ 2 million a day in recent years.

 As forest fires spread through the West, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is spreading the word: Help! The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has put out a call for temporary firefighters to battle the hundreds of blazes scorching the West's timberlands. But the emergency help must endure backbreaking labor, smoke and flame. And only local people need apply. Meanwhile, governors in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> called up National Guardsmen today to help fight fires in their states. The <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has notified <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regions affected by the dozens of out of control fires that temporary firefighters may be hired on a contingency basis, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON>, information officer for the center that coordinates fire suppression in the West. The temporary `` emergency firefighting hires,'' or `` casuals,'' must have the physical and mental capacity to work on the fire lines, including long days of shoveling and chopping on steep hillsides very near burning timber, <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> said. `` The job carries with it a lot of drama and romance,'' <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> said. `` But somedays you've got to ask yourself, ` Why am I doing this?''' `` What we're doing is only hiring from the local community,'' he said. `` I've had people calling from all over the country, and some wanting to volunteer. I've had people wanting to take their vacation and work, if you can believe that.'' <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> said those interested should contact their local national forest office, not the <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> center and not the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. Applicants will undergo an aerobic stress test, which measures the ability of the heart to recover from exertion. While some fire officials have set the total number of temporary workers needed at 4,000, <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> said each national forest must determine its requirements and the cost of employing those extra people. `` We're making assessments about our needs in the situation. We're not saying we're going to hire 4,000 or 8,000,'' he said. The emergency labor is a unique situation in a unique fire year. Late last week, the fire center estimated that 66,000 fires had scorched more than 3.3 million acres, mostly in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. There are 547 20-member crews, or 10,940 regular firefighters, battling the West's fires, <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> said. Nearly 1,600 water pumper trucks are manned by 15,213 people, or an average three crew members per vehicle. About 630 people are flying in helicopters for aerial observation or water drops. And 2,400 soldiers have been called to the lines, <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> said. That does not include the scores of people who have contracted to cut timber, cater meals at fire camps or bulldoze lines. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> does not expect to have the `` casuals'' trained and fitted for fighting fires until Friday, <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> said. `` We will not put them in a situation that is more than what they can bite and chew,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The mysterious helicopter that swooped into a federal prison yard where an international `` techno-bandit'' was waiting to escape actually belonged to the government, because the plot was no secret. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> did n't know government agents were aware of his plan, and he ran and walked toward the aircraft as it hovered above the empty softball field at the Federal Correctional Institution Saturday evening, officials said Monday. The helicopter belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and was flown by a Customs agent. And Bruchhausen only got to within about 20 feet of the aircraft before he was arrested by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent and four prison officers. `` Possibly 2 -LCB- weeks ago we received information at the institution from an unnamed source that Mr. <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> was talking about escaping from the institution,'' said prison warden <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Honsted </PERSON>. `` Through the monitoring of telephone conversations we were able to piece together, along with the other agencies, certain elements of the plot,'' <PERSON> Honsted </PERSON> said. Officials released some details of the foiled escape attempt at a news conference Monday but refused to answer many questions, citing a continuing investigation. After the thwarted escape attempt, the West German citizen convicted in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> of selling high-tech products to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European countries was transferred to the federal penitentiary in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON>, who has been at the medium - to minimum-security facility since May 1987, was willing to pay for his escape, <PERSON> Honsted </PERSON> said `` It's our belief that a sum of money, approximately or possibly as high as a quarter of a million dollars, was mentioned,'' the warden said. `` There was actually $ 5,000 that was received in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> as partial payment.'' <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> could face additional charges of attempted escape and conspiracy to escape, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said Monday. Those charges have not yet been filed, but a conspiracy charge has been filed against an individual still at large whom <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> refused to identify. <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> and three others were indicted in August 1981 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on charges of conspiracy and violating the Export Administration Act, the Arms Export and Control Act and federal income tax laws. He was arrested May 1985 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, extradited and convicted of wire fraud in 1987. <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> allegedly smuggled a microwave receiver system, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, a computer system and other military and scientific items to the Soviet bloc through dummy corporations in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON>. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON> in 1981 called <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> `` one of the world's top techno-bandits'' and said he was `` deceiving and defrauding <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses by selling potential high technology to the Soviets.''

 Some students at crowded <ORGANIZATION> Lassiter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> complain that spaghetti, fish, hot dogs and pizza are not exactly what breakfast is supposed to be. But when you eat it at 9:33 a.m., what else do you call it? Because only so many of <PERSON> Lassiter </PERSON>'s 2,100 students can fit into the lunchroom at one time, that's when the first lunch period begins. `` It stinks,'' said <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, 17. `` When you get up in the morning and eat breakfast, when you go to lunch you're full. And when you get home you pig out.'' Last year, when the <ORGANIZATION> Cobb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> school in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> metropolitan area had 2,500 students _ 500 over capacity _ lunch started even earlier. `` We have improved,'' joked principal <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. `` We were serving at 9:13 a.m.; now it's 9:33.'' From a nutritional standpoint, there's nothing wrong with lunch for breakfast, said food service assistant <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greaves </PERSON>. `` They're given food groups that they need to give them energy during the day,'' she said Some students do n't appreciate that. `` They should serve grits and pancakes,'' said <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, 17. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the school tried adding brunch items last year, but the novelty wore off and students went back to the fast-food line.

 A 36-year-old white man accused of lobbing a hand grenade into a crowd of blacks during a racial melee could be charged with as many as nine counts of attempted murder, police said. The brawl between club-wielding whites and rock - and bottle-throwing blacks capped long-simmering tensions in a racially mixed community, residents said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Langston </PERSON> was arrested Monday and charged with two counts of attempted murder and with throwing an explosive device, Manatee Sheriff <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Langston </PERSON> was held in the <LOCATION> Manatee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail with bail set at $ 150,000. There were no critical injuries from the blast, authorities said. Seven people were treated for shrapnel wounds and two others suffered minor injuries, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said.. `` We possibly will be charging him with as many as nine counts of attempted murder,'' said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, who described the grenade attack was `` an isolated racial incident. But residents of the neighborhood, called `` <LOCATION> Duplex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' said racial tensions have run high since the opening three months ago of the <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION>, which they said is frequented by `` rednecks'' and members of a motorcycle gang. It was not known whether <PERSON> Langston </PERSON>, who worked at the pub, was a member of a motorcycle gang, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. The fight broke out Sunday evening between about 15 blacks in the parking lot of a convenience store and about 35 patrons of the adjacent bar, police said. Whites yelled racial slurs as the confrontation grew heated, according to witness <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 19. He said he saw a white man emerge from the area of the bar and lob the grenade. `` He just popped the clip. He just threw it. Then in five seconds there was a boom!'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said, adding that everyone in the parking lot scrambled for cover. The explosion caused about $ 30,000 damage to the cars and shattered windows of surrounding businesses. `` It looked like guerilla warfare,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Langston </PERSON> was arrested on warrants issued after witnesses and acquaintances talked to police, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. Police reports show <PERSON> Langston </PERSON> has been charged twice since 1981 for aggravated battery but never convicted.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general today blamed disagreements over an immediate troop withdrawal and a maritime cease-fire for stalling formal Iran-Iraq peace talks. `` We are trying to clear the first part -LRB- of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace resolution -RRB- on an immediate cease-fire and a troop withdrawal without delay ... The cease-fire at sea is part of the problem,'' Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said. Formal sessions between Foreign Ministers <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been suspended since Friday. Plans for a formal session Monday were shelved without explanation, and no formal talks were planned today. Low-level talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> were continuing. In an interview today, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would not grant <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> any concessions which it had failed to win in the 8-year-old war. He blamed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for lack of progress in the talks. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was facing many internal difficulties, adding: `` We think this is the main reason they are looking for some advantage, some concessions. But if they could n't get any concessions during this long war with a lot of casualties, of course they will not be able to get any concessions or anything beyond their legal rights during the peace talks.'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio today quoted <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had raised `` unnecessary or out-of-place issues to disrupt the talks.'' In the interview with <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, he said he hoped <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and other nations can pressure <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and `` put a stop to this deviating course ... or force them to come back to the correct path.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> met with representatives of the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ on Monday to brief them on the negotiations. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> did not comment on the discussions. But diplomats speculated that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief was hoping the five nations would help get the talks moving. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been insisting on an early reopening of the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway, which has been blocked by sunken ships since early in the war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said clearing the waterway _ <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the sea _ should come later after a permanent cease-fire and troop withdrawal. Talks reportedly faltered at the ministerial level because of the dispute over the <PERSON> Shatt-al-Arab </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> claims sovereignty over the entire Shatt-al-Arab. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims rights to half of it. The issue is central to the talks because the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan calls for troop withdrawal to internationally recognized boundaries. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said today: `` You all think that everything is the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> _ this is not quite true. This is one of the difficulties we are facing and not the only one.'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said Monday that it would be impossible to advance to other points until <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed that the cease-fire extended over all Persian Gulf waters. `` It is a very difficult problem and it can not be expected that this will be resolved in a few days,'' Perez de <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said. The talks began Thursday to try forge a peace treaty and a timetable for troop withdrawal and prisoner exchange under a U.N.-mediated Aug. 20 cease-fire. The two countries have in the past often ignored previous agreements on the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway, a point of friction since the days of the Persian and Ottoman empires. A Western diplomat trying to settle the question in 1914 called it `` a phenomenon of procrastination unparalleled in the chronicles of oriental diplomacy.'' Five days before Iraqi troops invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980 after weeks of border clashes, President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> tore up the latest treaty on the waterway, the Algiers Agreement of 1975, during a televised speech. The agreement between <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, then foreign minister, and the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> set the border between the two nations in the middle of the 125 mile-long waterway, instead of its Iranian bank _ a dividing line in a 1969 agreement. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said Monday that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> could not unilaterally abrogate the 1975 treaty. But <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> told reporters that it was `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that always abrogated previous agreements, imposing new ones by force.'' `` This reflects the situation in the 17th, 18th, 19th and early in the 20 centuries, right up to present times,'' he added.

<TEXT>
 A 27-year-old swimming instructor waded out of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> today, the first person to swim all five Great Lakes. Canadian marathoner <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> took just less than 24 hours to make the 31-mile crossing _ much faster than her original estimate of 36 hours _ despite using the difficult butterfly stroke for most of the swim. She began at <LOCATION> Niagara-on-the-Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, and was supposed to finish her swim at the Canadian National Exhibition grounds in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, but strong currents pushed her about three miles east. She waded out of the lake at 6:03 a.m. EDT. `` I feel good. I'm glad it's over, though,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, visibly tired and disoriented. `` It was really tough because of the butterfly,'' she said, her teeth chattering. She was taken away quickly in a van. During her crossing, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> claimed a women's world distance record for the butterfly stroke, bettering her 1984 mark of 12 miles after just six hours in the water. She swam the butterfly stroke for 23.6 miles across the lake _ nearly doubling her record. Before the crossing, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said she planned to switch to the easier freestyle stroke shortly after breaking her record for the butterfly. But the <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, woman did n't seem to feel the strain of the awkward butterfly _ which involves throwing both arms over the head and doing a dolphin-like kick simultaneously. She started her five-lake marathon in July in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, crossed sections of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> later that month and completed a 21-mile arm of <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 15. The swims were organized as part of a fundraising drive to help pay for a swimming pool for the disabled in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. She has raised half of her $ 243,000 goal. Last summer, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> became the first person to swim across <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> and back.

Then he was escorted to the exchange to start trading promptly at 9:30 a.m.. After the bell rang, apparently not promptly enough, a handful of cheers by traders were nearly drowned out in a chorus of boos <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> then took a walk around the floor of the exchange, shaking hands with the traders, most of whom were already engaged in the frantic business of the day. Speaking to reporters afterward, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he had been told it was traditional to boo anyone who started the trading day late. Anyway, he said, `` Cheers and jeers are part of Americana.''

 Former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, must stand trial to determine whether they had a part in the slaying of two union leaders in 1981, a federal judge ruled. In a decision she said was certain to be appealed, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> denied a request Monday by the deposed leader and his wife to be dismissed from a wrongful death suit filed by relatives of the slain unionists. The case is scheduled to go to trial next year. <PERSON> Silme </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Viernes </PERSON>, anti-Marcos reform leaders in the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Filipino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cannery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, were gunned down at the union hall on June 1, 1981. Their survivors filed suit the next year, claiming in part that the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> regime ordered the shootings. The Marcoses claimed head-of-state immunity. A second federal judge dismissed the Marcoses as defendants in the lawsuit in December 1982, while <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was still president. In 1987, after the Marcoses fled the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> ruled they had to stand trial, and her decision Monday reaffirmed that ruling. `` Head-of-state immunity serves to safeguard the relations among foreign governments and their leaders _ not as the <ORGANIZATION> Marcoses </ORGANIZATION> assert, to protect former heads of state regardless of their lack of official status,'' the judge ruled. `` This court believes it is neither inequitable nor disturbing that a foreign official who takes refuge in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must defend the legality of private acts committed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' she added. Other defendants in the case include the Republic of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Leonilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> doctor, and three men who were convicted on state criminal charges in the case. The suit says Malabed controlled a fund from which $ 15,000 was paid for the slayings. The Marcoses fled the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in February 1986 when <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was sworn in as president. They now live in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. In an interview Monday, <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> have been close friends for many years. He denied that he or <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had anything to do with the shootings. `` I have no doubt even if he stood trial in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> that he would win the case because there is no evidence,'' <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON> said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, a local attorney representing the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in the case, said he had yet to see evidence linking <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> or the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government to the killings.

 The five Discovery astronauts and ground support teams today began staging their final long-duration rehearsal before the first launch of a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> space shuttle in more than 2 -LCB- years, officials said. About 300 people at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> took part in the 56-hour simulation of mission STS-26, a four-day shuttle flight, with as many as 200 others taking part in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>. The scheduled 8 a.m. test got off to a late start because of a malfunction in the shuttle simulator, but the problem was corrected and countdown ended at 9:04 a.m., said spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. Commander <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, pilot <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> `` Pinky'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> will face about 150 simulated problems during the lengthy test. `` The people who do the simulation, the ` sim' supervisors, sort of wage a mental battle with the flight controllers,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. `` They will do everything they can to make it more difficult. They try to throw a problem at each major -LRB- flight -RRB- system.'' Lounge and <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> may have to wear spacesuits to wrestle a mock satellite in the space center water tank, the crew may be asked to make an unplanned landing, and early deployment of a $ 100 million <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> communications satellite may be thrown off schedule during the test. `` I will feel good if they work through the scenarios, if they understand what they did and why they did it,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. The rehearsal was scheduled to end by 5 p.m. Thursday, and a full day of debriefing will follow, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. The actual launch of the shuttle Discovery is slated for late September or early October if sluggish oxygen valves and a hydrogen leak are repaired in time, according to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today scoffed at the Republican wish list of weapons, saying `` you ca n't have them all'' and still balance the budget, while Republican running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is wrong to call Star Wars a fantasy. `` It is called defending <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> finished up a two-day swing through his home state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> today as representatives of both campaigns opened summit-style negotiations to hammer out a schedule for fall debates. `` I believe they recognize how important it is to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that there be debates,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said before he and campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, media adviser <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> and adviser <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, speaking to reporters on his way in to the meeting in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> offices of <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>' law firm, was asked how many debates were expected. `` That's what we're here to find out,'' he said.

In an appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>, meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> opened by saying, `` I've become very accustomed to fighting fires the last couple of weeks. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made his call Monday for a return to the rhetorical high ground while being criticized by Democrats for letting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> control the debate with attacks on the Democrat's patriotism, views on defense and gun control and a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough program. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, during a tour of western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to highlight that area's economic resurgence, said he was `` trying to get this campaign up where it belongs'' by discussing his economic positions. But the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also countered <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks on the furlough program and launched his own salvo on the vice president's support for a reduction in the capital gains tax In his counterattack, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> showed a newly aggressive posture. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at a news conference he wants to ask <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about the 16,000 furloughs granted to federal prisoners last year, `` some lasting 45 days and many to convicted drug pushers Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he wants to execute.'' And in a luncheon speech before the news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` We're not going to accept Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s suggestion that the way to build opportunity for our citizens is to cut taxes for the wealthy again, this time with a $ 40 billion handout, 70 percent of which would go to those making $ 200,000 a year or more.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the furlough program, since amended, because one prisoner on a weekend pass raped a woman. The vice president also advocates the death penalty for drug dealers. `` Ten weeks from tomorrow, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will choose a new president,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The campaign is a golden and historic moment to define our nation's future. My friends, let us not waste this opportunity.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, during a tour of a defense plant in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, belittled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs anti-tank weapons rather than MX mobile missiles, saying both systems are needed for a strong defense. `` Does he understand the principles of deterrence, keeping the peace by deterring war?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It's not a choice between the two.'' During a later appearance in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has little standing to criticize the administration's drug-fighting policies, saying `` he is the governor who vetoed mandatory sentencing for drug dealers and is opposed to capital punishment for drug dealers.'' Both presidential contenders agreed it was time to leave by the wayside inquiries into <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s background and concentrate on the issues. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are n't interested in the grades that some of us might have gotten while we were in college,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, referring to queries about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s less than sterling academic performance. `` They care about whether their children will have the chance to go to college.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has absorbed a `` tremendous pounding'' over his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> service and other issues, and has `` emerged to where he will be an asset'' to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket. On the issue of presidential debates, the two campaigns disagree on the when and where. `` There will be an opportunity to debate, and I just do n't feel under any great rush,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of today's meeting between top aides in both campaigns. `` We might meet somebody halfway, but I'm not about to be stampeded I say, explain your views on defense. The response is, how about debates _ totally irrelevant.'' Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is using `` long-distance innuendo'' and `` transcontinental slurs'' while avoiding face-to-face confrontation. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has pressed for an earlier debate schedule than the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign wants. Republicans lead in assembling campaign warchests. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, in a report released Monday, said contributions to the five principal Republican campaign committees totaled $ 166.19 million during the 18 months ending June 30. During the same period, the five comparable Democratic committees raised $ 59.84 million.

 A mayor accused of `` voodoo'' antics undermined the legal process by granting pardons to repeat offenders and pocketed payments of some fines, the city attorney testified at his impeachment trial. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Grissett </PERSON>, the city attorney, testified Monday at the trial of <LOCATION> Florala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> H.T </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> that he had warned the 85-year-old official about abusing his legal authority to grant pardons. Charges against <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, who is accused of incompetence and damaging his small town's reputation with `` voodoo'' antics, include wholesale pardoning of convicted drunken drivers. `` It's my turn -LRB- today -RRB-,'' the mayor said Monday at the conclusion of the first day of his trial in <ORGANIZATION> Covington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Early today, three of the mayor's supporters stood outside the courthouse carrying placards that said `` Impeach <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegelman </PERSON>,'' the state attorney general who rarely appears at trials but joined his aides at this one. <PERSON> Grissett </PERSON> also testified that the town of 5,000, located near the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> border, was forced to file suit against the mayor to prevent him from accepting payments of some fines and depositing them in his personal account. `` He was taking partial payments outside court on the installment basis,'' <PERSON> Grissett </PERSON> told the jury. He said <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> deposited $ 225 in fines in his personal account and did not return the money `` until I filed suit.'' <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestwood </PERSON>, questioned <PERSON> Grissett </PERSON> about the mayor's authority to grant pardons. The attorney conceded that <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> had that power, but contended that he had abused it by granting pardons to repeat offenders. <PERSON> Siegelman </PERSON> and a county grand jury accused <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> of misusing his office by granting too many pardons for drunken drivers. The mayor is accused of willful neglect of duty, incompetency in office and corruption. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, whose four-year term expires Oct. 3, attracted national attention by sprinkling so-called `` voodoo dust'' around City Hall and later proclaiming `` National Voodoo Week'' in <LOCATION> Florala </LOCATION>. He says he sprinkled the powder as a joke. In opening arguments, <PERSON> Prestwood </PERSON> portrayed <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> as the victim of a political struggle with the City Council. But Councilman <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> testified that the `` voodoo'' dusting incident had damaged the town's reputation and that the mayor offered no explanation except to say, `` When it works, he would let us know.'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said the council had to obtain a court order to halt the mayor from releasing people from jail. `` He would order the dispatcher to turn people out of jail,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. Later, the mayor began granting pardons to those in custody. In other testimony, several <LOCATION> Florala </LOCATION> residents who had been arrested on minor offenses said they had pawned their cars to the mayor in exchange for payment of fines. They said they later reimbursed <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> in amounts larger than the fines to get their cars back. In one instance, however, <PERSON> Rachael </PERSON> <PERSON> Aplin </PERSON> said the mayor had already sold her car to the daughter of a city councilman and she was unable to get the vehicle back. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> officials found guilty of impeachment charges are only removed from office, not fined or sent to jail. However, they can face another trial for the same crimes. An official thrown out of office can appeal the verdict directly to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

 Governors in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> called in National Guardsmen today to bolster weary firefighters battling dozens of wildfires, while a remote <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> town mopped up after lightning-sparked blazes swept within feet of the community. Fire forced officials to evacuate a hospital in the remote town for several hours. Favorable weather conditions Monday helped firefighters keep blazes from gaining much ground in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. But the wildfires were far from out. And dozens of fires that have been allowed to burn for months in the vast interior of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, largely in scrubland, have charred more than 1.2 million acres. A fire flare-up prevented Yellowstone National Park officials from reopening the park's south entrance today and they braced for possible stronger wind that could whip up the fires. Firefighters in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> hoped to get the upper hand on fires that have blackened almost 200,000 acres. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> placed the entire state under an extreme fire emergency, releasing National Guardsmen to reinforce 2,000 firefighters battling the worst wildfires. But officials feared a weather front expected today would bring gusts that would push the flames past fire lines. Among the priorities was the 16,000-acre Battle Axe fire on the Middle Fork of the <LOCATION> Salmon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Church-River </PERSON> of No Return Wilderness. It jumped the river to threaten a score of summer homes, and an unoccupied forest ranger station and airstrip at <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, firefighters late Monday kept fast-moving fires from reaching a hospital, school and other buildings in remote <LOCATION> Portola </LOCATION>. There were no injuries in the town of 1,600 residents, and the only building lost was a barn, as a fire shooting flames 150 feet high was halted at the eastern edge of the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> town. About 30 patients and staff were evacuated from the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plumas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, first to a community hall several blocks away on the other side of the middle fork of the <LOCATION> Feather </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which runs through the center of <LOCATION> Portola </LOCATION>, and then to other hospitals. The hospital was reopened after 5 -LCB- hours. Officials said an afternoon storm sparked about 20 fires around the community, about 45 miles northwest of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev </LOCATION>. Most of the fires continued burning today, blackening 1,200 acres. One lightning strike started a fire behind <ORGANIZATION> Portola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> just a few minutes before classes were dismissed. `` When we walked out onto the field for -LRB- football -RRB- practice, it was just smoking,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Muscatt </PERSON>, 15, adding that within a few minutes, `` the flames were 80 feet high.'' In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where some fires have been burning since April, the biggest blaze had covered more than 541,000 acres 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION>. But the fires do not threaten any developed property or valuable timber, and a special interagency office handing fire information for the state has been disbanded for the season. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, firefighters in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> regained ground against one of the tougher fires roaring in the park, sealing off Old Faithful geyser from flames five miles away. Continued calm winds allowed thousands of firefighters to make further inroads in their battle against 10 major fires, which have charred 450,000 acres of the park's 2.2 million acres. That calm weather had prompted a decision to reopen <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s south entrance for the first time in 10 days, but park spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON> said fire activity put the area back in danger. She would not make a new prediction as to when the road, which has been closed for 10 days, would reopen. Wyoming Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> called out 120 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> volunteers Monday to aid in the battle against a 15,000-acre blaze near <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> outside <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>. The guardsmen were to go to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for 32 hours of training, and the majority would then be sent to that blaze. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, one major fire was brought under control Monday, but others burned on more than 187,000 acres. The 37,600-acre Warm Springs Creek fire, which destroyed 13 homes and cabins near <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, was declared controlled after three weeks, and most of the 2,500 firefighters were released, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukenhofer </PERSON>, fire information officer. Costs of fighting the blaze are expected to reach $ 10 million. The Combination fire, between <LOCATION> Philipsburg </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> in west-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, grew to 10,000 acres, and firefighters braced for gusty winds. The winds could move the flames east toward the small community of <LOCATION> Maxville </LOCATION>, about four miles away, said information officer <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>. But at the 1,900-acre <LOCATION> Lolo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire in western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, the winds were expected to bring safety to about 56 homes sandwiched between the southern edge of the fire and a highway. All but one of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s major forest fires have been virtually contained or controlled, but the largest burned out of control Monday in the northeast. The Tepee Butte fire grew to 33,600 acres of grass and timber in the <ORGANIZATION> Wallowa-Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and the Hell's <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> about 25 miles north of Enterprise. The growth from 28,000 acres was largely due to backfires set to consume fuel in the path of the flames, officials said. Shifting winds in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state fanned worries that several fires burning on the <ORGANIZATION> Kettle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> would merge to become one large conflagration, said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The Kettle Range fires on the Colville Indian Reservation were the biggest of the blazes that have blackened more than 19,000 acres of the state's forest and rangelands. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, firefighters contained a 525-acre fire near the <LOCATION> Pineview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservoir </LOCATION>, 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION>, and moved in to douse remaining hot spots.

 <LOCATION> RUNDU </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The last <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> troops withdrew today from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> after fighting for more than a year in support of anti-Marxist guerrillas. The armed forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleeson </PERSON>, said at a ceremony that nearly 1,000 soldiers crossed into <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> during the day as part of a regional peace accord. `` As of this moment, we are out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gleeson </PERSON> said. South African and foreign journalists were flown to <LOCATION> Rundu </LOCATION>, on the Angolan border, to witness what the final stages of the withdrawal of South African forces. They saw 50 military vehicles cross a pontoon bridge over the <LOCATION> Okavango </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> before the bridge was dismantled. In <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, military officials said security forces in the past week killed 14 guerrillas fighting to end South African rule over the territory. South African forces also staged their first amphibious landing exercise today on the Namibian coast. South African forces have been in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since early 1987. The pullout from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is part of a cease-fire agreement that is intended to clear the way for withdrawal of about 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. An estimated 2,500 South African troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> have been leaving since a cease-fire was declared Aug. 8. The Cuban troops support <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government in its 13-year-old war against guerrillas of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -RRB-. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> back <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> is not party to the cease-fire and was excluded from recent peace talks held by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediation. There have been unconfirmed reports that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has been reinforcing its line of bases in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The amphibious landing exercise was conducted on a beach near <LOCATION> Walvis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, a South African enclave that serves as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s only commercial port. High-speed landing craft carried marines and paratroopers ashore as part of a six-week exercise involving about 2,500 military personnel. The <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the main pro-independence movement in the territory, contends <LOCATION> Walvis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> should become part of a sovereign <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s deputy defense minister, <PERSON> Wynand </PERSON> <PERSON> Breytenbach </PERSON>, said Monday the port would remain under South African control and continue to serve as a military base. The South African-led territorial army said today that 14 <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have been killed in the last week. <LOCATION> SWAPO </LOCATION>, considered likely to take power if independence elections are held, has said it will observe a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> starting Thursday if <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> reciprocates. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says it will begin withdrawing from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> on Nov. 1 and allow the territory to hold independence elections next June 1 if Cuban troops leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by the latter date. The four countries involved in the negotiations met last week in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, but failed to agree on a timetable for <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and Namibian independence. More talks are planned next week. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has intervened in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> regularly since 1975 when it invaded the country on the eve of Angolan independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> advanced several hundred miles up <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s west coast before turning back South African forces returned to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> several times in the early 1980s, but in May 1985 announced a complete withdrawal. Several weeks later, two South African commandos were killed and a third was captured in northernmost <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Thousands of South African troops entered <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 1987 to assist <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. South African generals said their maximum strength in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> was 3,000 men, although other reports claimed the force was twice that size during heavy fighting last October. In November, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said its forces again had begun withdrawing, but most of the troops remained until this month. Dozens of white South African troops, most of them conscripts, have been killed in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> the past year. Black units, including Angolans fighting for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, are believed to have suffered heavier casualties, but no comprehensive figures have been released.

Investigators have been looking into allegations that <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> overcharged the military for the components, used defective parts in the devices and delivered them behind schedule. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> has been charged by the government with $ 3 million in civil fraud, but no criminal charges.

 A rapid-fire pistol and an automatic rifle were found last year at the home of <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, wife of jailed black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, a police officer testified Tuesday. Lt. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kritzinger </PERSON> appeared in <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> at the trial of five blacks charged with two counts of murder and with illegal possession of weapons. No charges have been filed against Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kritzinger </PERSON> said he and other policemen, in two visits to Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s house in the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> in February 1987, found a Soviet-made AK-47 rifle in a bedroom and a Czech-made Scorpion machine pistol. The lieutenant said police asked Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and her daughter <PERSON> Zindzi </PERSON>, where the pistol came from `` and got no positive response.'' <PERSON> Kritzinger </PERSON> said such weapons normally are brought into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by guerrillas of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after military training abroad. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> led the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s military wing prior to his arrest in 1962. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 aimed at ending white minority rule.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says it is `` reluctant to pass judgment'' on air shows, but <ORGANIZATION> Vandenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base today said an annual flying show featuring the <ORGANIZATION> Thunderbirds </ORGANIZATION> will proceed next month as scheduled. The American military considers air shows a potent recruiting tool, but new safety questions have arisen since an accident Sunday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in which 47 people were killed and hundreds injured when three Italian <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jets collided during a high-speed air show maneuver above <ORGANIZATION> Ramstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a public affairs officer at <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION>, said the base's Sept. 18 air show would be `` held in strict accordance with <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regulations.'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said base officials had to submit a map of the runway area to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for approval. Earlier today, Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, D-Wash., said he had written to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> asking for a review of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on air shows `` I think we can make these shows safer,'' <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' He said officials should consider requiring that spectators be moved back further from aerial demonstrations. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, briefing reporters Monday in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> while President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vacationed at his nearby ranch, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was assisting in the investigation of Sunday's accident in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was sending messages of condolence to the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people and others. Members of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s military aerial stunt teams have been killed in the past, but none has ever killed a spectator. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> regulates the aerial teams and limits the maneuvers they may perform. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was rethinking its position on such shows, said, `` We do n't have all the details of this incident, so we're most reluctant to pass judgment on this episode or on air shows in general.'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has a lot of air shows,'' the spokesman said. `` We have them at <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases. Many are military-oriented. There are a lot of private air shows around the country. It's been a long tradition in various circumstances to have these kinds of air shows. So we would be reluctant to make any judgments at this time. `` It certainly does, however, emphasize the need for vigilance and safety,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. `` And I'm sure that those matters will be considered. I noticed that the West German authorities did indicate they would not have any more air shows. But at this point, we do n't have any conclusion on that subject.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s Thunderbirds have been appearing at air shows for decades. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> determined last year that 63 percent of the students entering <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> flight school had seen at least one Blue Angels performance. Of those, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said, almost 40 percent cited the team as a direct influence on their decision to join the military. A pilot was killed during a <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> demonstration over <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, in July 1985. The worst accident in the history of the Thunderbirds occurred Jan. 18, 1982, during a practice session in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Four pilots died as a team followed its leader into the ground. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday the agency `` would n't allow aerobatic maneuvers above the crowd'' or approaching spectators. `` Our minimum flight line for jets is 1,500 feet from the crowd, and we require all maneuvers be performed along that line,'' <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said. Witnesses to the West German disaster said the Italian air force's team of 10 jets was flying about 180 feet off the ground and intersecting over the field from three different directions, a maneuver that put some of the jets on a course directly toward the crowd. `` Overall, the safety record for air shows in this country is really outstanding,'' said <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>, noting that there are more than 200 such shows staged annually nationwide. `` We control the air space, so it is up to us to make sure that all operations in that airspace are conducted properly and safely,'' <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said. `` The Thunderbirds and the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> put their shows together, but we decide on a show-by-show basis whether there is airspace to accommodate the maneuvers safely.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters the administration was `` deeply saddened'' by the accident. `` We extend our sympathies to the families of those killed and injured in the crash,'' he said. `` The president will be sending messages of condolence to the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people and to others who are affected by the tragedy. Details of those messages are still being worked out, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government is assisting the Italian government in investigating the cause of the accident.'' Most of the more than 300,000 spectators at the air show were West Germans and Americans. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said a team from <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was flying to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to assist in treatment of the injured, particularly burn victims.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said today many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> elementary schools suffer from defective curricula and need a strong dose of the classics, rigorous math and science and foreign language study in the 4th grade. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> held a news conference to unveil his proposed model, called `` <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>: A Curriculum for American Students.'' He said it is a sequel to the `` <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'' model he issued last December, and he joked that this one could be called `` <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said elementary schools generally are in better shape than high schools, but at most `` maybe a third of our schools'' are offering a curriculum as strong as the one he favors. `` If there's a crucial point here, it's the 4th grade,'' he said. `` We see a 4th-grade slump in reading ... math and science.'' He said American grade schools probably devote more time to math than Japanese schools do, but too much of it is spent on dull workbooks and too often parents, teachers and students alike accept the notion that some students just can not handle math. `` We need a little more persistence,'' he said. `` We have put together a curriculum for all children,'' not just for the affluent or college-bound, he said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who is leaving his post Sept. 20, called it `` my final report to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people as secretary.'' The report outlines what <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> calls `` a sound elementary school core curriculum'' from kindergarten through eighth grade in seven subjects: English, social studies, mathematics, science, foreign language, fine arts and physical and health education. Its suggested reading list ranges from the tales of <LOCATION> Pippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Longstocking </LOCATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Piggle-Wiggle </PERSON> for the early grades to `` The Red Badge of Courage'' and `` <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>'s Adventures in Wonderland'' for older pupils. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he emphasized classics `` because they are so often missing from elementary school instruction.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has no authority to force a single school in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to follow any of his suggestions. Public school curricula are determined by state and local school agencies, and private schools are free to set their own courses. The 1979 law that created the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> specifically forbade the agency from prescribing curricula. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he was just offering some free advice. `` I do not presume to instruct teachers _ or parents, principals, administrators and school boards _ in the details of their daily jobs or in the exact shape, sequence and specialized content of their elementary school curricula,'' he said. The document `` is not a monolithic program to be uniformly imposed or slavishly followed,'' he said. Instead, `` it is intended more broadly as a statement of goals.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s suggestions for social studies include: American history in each of the first five grades, world history and geography in sixth and seventh grades, and both world geography and American government in eighth grade. He would have all youngsters take either algebra or pre-algebra by eighth grade. His science curriculum would be capped with biology in seventh grade and some chemistry and physics in eighth grade. He said foreign language instruction should start `` no later than fourth grade.'' `` We want our students _ by the end of 8th grade _ to read, write and speak clear and grammatical English, and to be acquainted with the varieties and qualities of fiction and nonfiction literature. We want them to know the essential features of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and world history, the major landscapes and nations of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, and the rights and obligations that belong to citizens of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he wrote. `` We want them to be proficient in arithmetic and geometry, and familiar with basic principles of algebra. We want them to have begun exploring biology, chemistry, physics and a foreign language; to have investigated the history and practice of art and music; and to have developed the habits of health, fitness and athletic fair play.'' The report profiles seven schools as models of strong elementary curricula: <ORGANIZATION> Meridith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magnet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Blaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Blaine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; School No. 59, Science Magnet, in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> LaSalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Language </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Maryetta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stilwell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>.

 The four-man junta met today to nominate the sole candidate _ expected to be President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> _ in a presidential referendum that could extend <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s rule until 1997. National police troops cordoned off the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> building where army commander Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> chief Adm. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, air force commander Gen. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON> and national police director Gen. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stange </PERSON> began their nomination session at noon behind closed doors. Their selection will be presented for ratification or rejection in an October referendum. Under the election rules established by the military government, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> _ who deposed the elected president in a bloody 1973 military coup _ and the other three junta members were to name a single nominee and voters will vote `` yes'' or `` no'' on that candidate. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, Merino, <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stange </PERSON>, all in dress military uniforms, arrived one at a time at the ministry building, entering on a thick red carpet rolled out for the occasion. None made any remarks. While the other commanders arrived by car, the 72-year-old <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and his entourage of aides and bodyguards came on foot from the government palace directly across <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s central boulevard. He was both cheered and booed by bystanders. Both pro-and anti-Pinochet groups planned demonstrations in connection with the nomination. Gen. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, national police sub-director, said `` we have certainly taken some special security measures, especially in the slums, where some day there might be problems. `` We do n't expect serious problems,'' he added. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardemil </PERSON> told reporters `` there is total and complete calm throughout the country. And I do n't think the government will need to take any extraordinary measures. On Monday, police used water cannons to scatter a downtown demonstration by women chanting anti-government slogans and urging voters to vote `` no'' in the referendum. Witnesses said about 25 people were arrested. If a majority of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s 7.2 million registered voters cast `` yes'' ballots in the referendum, the nominee will begin an eight-year term March 11. If a majority reject him, an open election will be held in 1990, with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remaining in power until then. The 1980 Constitution gives the junta 48 hours to nominate a candidate. Were the commanders to fail to reach a unanimous decision within that time, the Constitution calls for nomination by majority decision of an eight-man <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which includes <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, navy chief Adm. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, air force commander Gen. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON> and national police director Gen. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stange </PERSON>. It also includes four other officials, three of whom are appointed by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. Opposition leaders said they had little doubt that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> would win a quick nomination and called on followers to bang empty pots and pans inside their homes tonight in protest. `` It will be the noisiest pot-banging ever heard,'' predicted <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a socialist and co-leader of a 16-party opposition coalition. Members of the youth wings of several opposition parties and a communist-controlled slum dwellers organization planned street demonstrations in central <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. The defense minister, Adm. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvajal </PERSON>, warned Monday that `` the government will not allow any violent demonstrations. They will be suppressed by police.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> led the coup that ousted the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> in September 1973.

<HEAD>Greenhouse Effect Can't Be Stopped, Even With Less CO2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of climate researchers has warned that the `` greenhouse effect'' warming of the Earth will continue even if there are sharp cutbacks in the use of the chemicals which cause the problem. The heatup `` appears to be inevitable, even with ... drastic, and probably unrealistic reductions, of greenhouse forcing'' by the release of carbon dioxide and other gases, the scientists reported in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres. The group, led by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, reached that conclusion after running computerized climate models in an effort to predict the climate in the future. The models looked at the effect of chemical releases at three different levels: continuing rapid release of the chemicals, as in recent years; release at slower rates, and a drastic cutback in those chemicals. In the first case, the Earth's average temperature was calculated to rise by 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit within 20 years. It would take 25 years for that increase in the second model. And even with the drastic `` and probably unrealistic'' cutback in chemical releases, the temperature would rise that much eventually, and probably would climb by 0.8 degrees within 15 years, according to the study. The greenhouse effect has drawn increasing concern recently, although most meteorologists contend that it is too early to determine if it is responsible for the current drought and hot weather affecting much of the nation. It occurs when carbon dioxide, largely from burning fossil fuels, and other gases _ such as methane and nitrogen oxides _ increase in the atmosphere. These gases let incoming heat from the sun reach the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, but block the Earth's own heat from traveling into space, much as a greenhouse traps heat indoors. As the gases become more abundant, more heat is trapped and the planet's temperature rises <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> told a congressional subcommittee earlier in the summer that the current hot, dry conditions are an example of things to come. In particular, he noted in the new report, while the average increase in global warming does n't sound like a lot it means increasing frequency for hot summers. And some areas will be affected more than others. If the summer outlook were a die with six faces, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> wrote, the period between 1950 and 1979 would have had two faces representing a hot year, two representing a normal year and two a cold year. By the 1990s, he anticipates, that die will be `` loaded,'' with three or four faces coming up hot when it is rolled. That means the chances of any particular summer being hotter than normal would top 50 percent, compared to the 33 percent chance of the past. And such a change would be large enough to affect the quality of life, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> and his co-authors reported. For example, they noted that over the past 30 years, <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, experienced a run of five or more consecutive days with a high of 95 degrees or more on an average of 3 times in 10 years. The climate model predicts that this could increase to 5 years out of 10 in the 1990s and 7 years out of 10 by 2020. Such an increase in the number of runs of hot weather can damage corn and other crops, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> warned, and can also affect forests, water supplies, animals and people. A warming of 0.8 degrees in a decade is faster than any found in historical studies and is thought to be faster than most plants are able to accommodate. `` We emphasize that it is the possibility of rapid climate change which is of most concern for the biosphere; there may not be sufficient time for many biosystems to adapt to the rapid changes forecast for scenarios involving rapid growth of trace gases,'' wrote <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> and his co-authors. Other scientists have speculated that the increasing heat would cause some of the ice to melt in the polar regions, possibly raising sea levels around the world. The new report tends to reinforce that, by noting that the polar regions would likely be more affected by the rising temperature than some other regions. Regions where the warming showed up strongly included certain ocean areas including the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION>, Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>, parts of the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and sections of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> near and just north of the equator. In addition, the effects would be strongly felt in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kazakh-Mongolia-Manchuria </LOCATION> area and in the north and south polar regions, the report said. As to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, warming weather was predicted to have a greater effect in the East than in the West. Seven other scientists, from <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> developed the study with <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>.

 Sometimes, Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> seems barely able to control his glee over his Republican rival, fellow Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. When <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> first picked the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> hailed it as `` good news.'' With <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> soon swamped in controversy, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was asked what he would do if he were <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Sweat,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 67, is one of the lions of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after 18 years. He's chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, sponsor of some of the most important legislation of the decade, a successful businessman and decorated World War II bomber pilot. By comparison, in experience and accomplishments, the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> pales _ `` not a member of the club,'' sniffed one top <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic aide. And occasionally, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> lets slip that he really does n't think <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> measures up. In eight years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been known mostly for his fight for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative, his battle for the controversial federal court appointment of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Manion </PERSON> and a losing fight against the 60-day notification for plant closings. `` I do n't remember anything in particular,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, when asked if he had squared off against <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on any other issues. And he makes repeated subtle references to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s youth. `` I certainly do n't think he's too young but certainly you've got to have some maturity'' to be a heartbeat away from the presidency, he said at one <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> stop When reporters goaded <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> with questions on whether <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would still be on the ticket Nov. 8, the Texan finally could n't resist. `` I hope so,'' he said. But away from the public eye, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and his top aides are concerned about going into debate against <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is younger than President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was when he won the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but his face looks older, especially on television. The campaign has signed him up for coaching and makeup consultation so he wo n't appear wooden when put side-by-side with the handsome <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. And while a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> record takes years of consistent work, a televised debate is measured in 30-second bites. A well-briefed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, given the right format, could hold his own. And holding his own might be good enough to be declared the winner, given the low expectations accorded the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator. `` We're on the wrong end of the expectations game, as far as the vice presidential debate is concerned, because everyone expects Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to do so well,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Peek </PERSON>, a long-time <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic strategist who is now a private consultant in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Other Democrats already are defending <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in advance of a debate that may never come off. `` The senator is concerned about a debate because his style as a senator is to get things done and he does n't engage in a lot of sparring on the floor,'' national party spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. On the other hand, `` It's easy to envision <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as a TV talk show host.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also must be careful not to bludgeon <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and win him a backlash of sympathy among voters, as has occurred in the recent controversy over <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> record. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, who studies politics at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, says the Democrats have reason to worry about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` He is not a dummy,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. In past debates, such as when he defeated incumbent <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> to win the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> showed `` when he was prepared, well-briefed, and focused, he could do all right.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, meanwhile, has the difficult task of not wanting to help the Republicans in their expectations game and also not wanting to speak well of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` It is n't in <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s interest to talk about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. So while he clearly sees <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as a lesser opponent, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> must focus his attacks away from the man and back to the issues and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s conservative voting record. `` I do n't want to get into his personal life. That I do n't want to do,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> says. Then <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> hints about which Republican would have been a worthy opponent. `` I thought it would be <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, frankly,'' he says. `` It's a real gamble picking <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, and I think it's going to be proven that way.''

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is shrewd, combative and firmly in command of his army, implacable with critics and tireless in what he sees as a mission from God to build a ommunist-proof society. The president disdains alcohol, lifts weights and has a boxer's physique at age 72 in which he takes extra pride because of weakness as a child He defends his authoritarian style of politics as a bulwark against Marxism and has successfully resisted the current <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> trend toward elected civilian governments. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> gained power in a 1973 coup that ousted the elected government of President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a self-described Marxist who died during the takeover. Social unrest and economic chaos created wide support for the coup and it was commonly believed civilian rule would return in a few years. Instead, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> banned political activity and purged <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> of tens of thousands of leftists. Most were expelled, but human rights groups say hundreds were imprisoned and scores were tortured and executed. The army, navy, air force and national police commanders were supposed to alternate as head of the junta, but <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> used political maneuvers and the pressure of his army, the most powerful branch, to become undisputed leader. He uses the military tactics of surprise and force in directing the nation and proudly states that his character was formed in the army. In recent years, especially since escaping an assassination attempt by leftist guerrillas in September 1986, he has cited the support of providence. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> declared last year: `` God put me on top.'' Another result of that attempt is an obsession with personal security. His motorcade routinely includes four carloads of heavily armed bodyguards, a van of army commandos and an ambulance, and a helicopter gunship often hovers overhead. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was born Nov. 25, 1915, in the port city of <LOCATION> Valparaiso </LOCATION>, one of three children of a customs official. He ignored parental pleas to study medicine and got into the military academy after two rejections _ the first time because he was too young and the second because of physical weakness. He filled out to a solid 185 pounds at the academy and earned a university degree. An autobiography published in 1980 says he became aware of an international Marxist threat while commanding a camp for communist prisoners in 1948, and later lectured at the national war college on the dangers of communism. When <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> became president, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remained outwardly loyal and was named army commander in August 1973, less than a month before the coup. Some other participants in the military rebellion said later he was an opportunist who joined the conspiracy at the last minute. Political repression after the coup earned <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> an international reputation as a harsh dictator. That image was bolstered by assassinations of exiled critics. They included <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Letelier </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister under <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, who was killed with an American assistant in 1976 when their car was blown up in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The general equated foreign criticism with interference in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. He announced plans to reshape Chilean society and build durable safeguards against communism. A constitution written by his administration and approved in a 1980 referendum outlaws ideologies based on class struggle. It also includes a phased return of democracy, but guarantees <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> the presidency until 1989 and makes an additional eight years possible if he wins a presidential referendum later this year. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> introduced a free-market economic program that, coupled with heavy foreign borrowing and an overvalued peso, produced record unemployment in the early 1980s and nearly led to financial collapse. Economic hardship inspired protests that threatened his government. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> moderated his policies, winning international approval and even the grudging praise of opponents after five years of steady economic growth and stability. He ceaselessly lashes the `` old guard'' civilian politicians he considers too weak and selfish to protect the nation's interests, and the attacks often are viciously personal. He recently called a prominent but very short political leader `` a human remnant.'' In the style of a stern uncle, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> preaches patriotism, family values and hard work. That appeals to many common Chileans, but his rural vernacular grates on many educated ears. <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON>, his wife, often appears in public with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and actively campaigns for his continuation as president. They have three daughters and two sons.

<TEXT>
 The American novelist <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sontag </PERSON> and writers from seven countries held a reception Tuesday night to dramatize the imprisonment of five South Korean literary figures. Ms. <PERSON> Sontag </PERSON> and her colleagues are in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> attending the 52nd International <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> P.E.N. </ORGANIZATION>, a London-based international association of poets, playwrights, editors, essayists and novelists. `` To be at this gathering while our colleagues sit in prison, some of them ill, all of them, ironically, deprived of pen and paper, is a profound disappointment and morally troubling to many of us,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sontag </PERSON> said. Honoring the writers at a reception in abstentia `` allows us to express our admiration and support for the courage of the democratic movements in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> at the same time that we are deliberating over the problems and literary concerns of writers all around the globe,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sontag </PERSON> said. The last time an International P.E.N. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was held in a nation where writers were imprisoned was nine years ago in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, she said. Delegations from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> co-hosted the reception honoring the imprisoned Koreans. The five were identified as publisher <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-bok </PERSON>, writers <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon-jang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Pu-yong </PERSON>, and poets <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> San-ha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nam-ju </PERSON>. The mother of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-bok </PERSON> read a letter from her son that said seven years of prison has been `` unbearable spiritually as well as physically'' and that he cherishes freedom of information. `` I have been isolated from the freedom of getting information, the freedom of expressing myself, and even the freedom of love,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said in a letter dictated to his brother during a prison visit Aug. 25. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> is now allowed to write himself, his family said. He said `` struggles for more freedom could never be stopped and will not be stopped.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s brother, his father and the editor of the family's publishing house were also present. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Waarsenberg </PERSON>, a poet from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, read the beginning lines of a 70-page poem that he said led to the imprisonment of poet <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> San-ha </PERSON>. P.E.N. said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was charged with violating national security in his poem `` MountHalla,'' which is about a massacre on the island of <LOCATION> Cheju </LOCATION> in 1945. Journalist <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Pu-yong </PERSON> sent a message from prison read by his lawyer, <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-gu </PERSON>, which said that while the P.E.N. delegates `` are feasting under the glittering chandeliers ... many angry Korean prisoners of conviction are still moaning behind bars.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> refused the offer of honorary P.E.N. membership, saying it would not be possible to accept while he and others were in prison. <PERSON> Agneta </PERSON> <PERSON> Pleijel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, president of the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> P.E.N. </ORGANIZATION>, read a love poem by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nam-ju </PERSON> who she said was arrested in 1979. Ms. <PERSON> Pleijel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s poems include some of her favorites.

<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a group of firefighters Tuesday that since he became the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee he has grown `` very accustomed to fighting fires'' that have erupted over his candidacy. `` Where were you when I needed you?'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>. Since he became <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been the subject of intense media scrutiny over allegations that he and his wealthy publishing family pulled strings to get him into the National Guard during the Vietnam War and into law school after a poor college performance. Those issues, among others, have at times threatened to overwhelm his campaign. `` Believe me, I feel that I am very accustomed to fighting fires these last couple of weeks,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, as the group erupted in laughter. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> preparing for this week's Southern campaign swing, said firefighters are `` heroes to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' because of the lives and property they save. `` You are really considered the heartbeat of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ volunteers, people willing to put their lives on the line, people that believe in themselves, people that make this country still the greatest country in the world,'' said the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator. He told the group that he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> support increasing death benefits for fallen firefighters as well as a strong national defense. `` National defense and defending our freedom, there is no higher cause,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was presented with a fire chief's hat, and told the group, `` This is going to be prominently displayed on my airplane ... right in front of where the press is sitting.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> leaves aboard his campaign plane, dubbed `` Hoosier Pride,'' on Wednesday for a trip south. He will stop in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Navy Will No Longer Dump Medical Waste At Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has ordered ships in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to stop dumping medical waste at sea, in response to complaints involving waste that washed ashore. Earlier this summer, beaches in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> were closed after a large quantity of waste washed ashore. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was not blamed in the dumping. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> admitted Aug. 8 that medical waste was dumped from two Norfolk-based ships after personnel from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the Marines were used to clean up a 26-mile stretch of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> beaches from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Emerald </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION>. Sailors and Marines collected what the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said was a trashbag full of medical supplies. Adm. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, head of the 300-ship <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> fleet, said Monday he sent a message to all commands on Saturday to cease dumping at sea. `` While only one of these incidents involved a small quantity of medical waste attributed to <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> ships, these incidents clearly dictate increased emphasis on proper disposal of all types of waste,'' <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said. Regulations will be adopted immediately by ship commanders that would require special handling of all potentially infectious medical waste, he said. <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> defined potentially infectious waste as disposable medical supplies designed for use in diagnosis, treatment, laboratory testing or training. Those items will include all sharp objects, containers of blood and blood products, pathology specimens and tissue, he said.

 An appeals court lifted a ban Tuesday on the Aug. 28 edition of a popular local daily that had lampooned <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The district court in Split, a city on the central Adriatic coast, rejected the demand for a permanent ban of the edition of <LOCATION> Nedeljna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dalmacija </LOCATION>, ruling there were no grounds to support it, the news agency said. The temporary ban was imposed by the Split public prosecutor's office, because of a commentary that lampooned party chief <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, president of the party's ruling Presidium, and other top officials `` It is hypocritical to forbid publications making fun of our top leaders, when jokes about them are constantly being told'' by the people, said the news agency quoted the court ruling as saying. It was not clear whether the prosecutor's office would appeal the verdict.

<HEAD>US Says Global Anti-Drug Effort Led to Seizures, 1,200 Arrests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials announced today the completion of a month-long international drug enforcement campaign that resulted in seizure of 11 tons of cocaine, destruction of 244 tons of marijuana and 1,200 arrests. Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the drive involved the unprecedented cooperation of 30 countries and international law enforcement agencies, principally in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The project, operated under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, also led directly to destruction of 118,000 coca plants, 13 cocaine laboratories and seven clandestine air strips, and seizure of $ 3.8 million in cash. During the Aug. 1-28 campaign, cooperating nations intensified border searches, located and destroyed chemical stores, increased patrols of airports and checked highway and river points known to have been used for illicit drug shipments. Authorities also were on a special alert to spot currency being smuggled in from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The statistics are not as important as the signal that has been sent to the drug kingpins,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` Henceforth they will increasingly face the combined fury of law enforcement agencies of all nations whose people they victimize.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> spoke at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference followed by television satellite coverage of a news conference from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> was meeting. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said that hemispheric nations generally fought the war on drugs individually in the past. Although they shared some data, he said, `` never before has there been such systematic and comprehensive cooperation, overcoming barriers of language, national boundaries, legal jurisdiction and other differences.'' The conference was set up in 1983 and includes <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A delegation from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> will take part in a ceremony this week honoring the 4,000 Polish officers slain in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, although the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is not taking responsiblity for the World War II massacre, a government spokesman said. A joint Soviet-Polish investigation into the killings has not been completed and the `` final truth'' about responsibility is still to be determined, said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>. For years, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government has blamed the killings in the forest near <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION>, 250 miles west of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, on <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> occupation forces. The Kremlin has maintained the massacre occurred in the fall of 1941, after the invasion of Nazi forces in June of that year. But Western historians contend the Soviet state security and police force carried out the massacre in April 1940. The Polish officers had been taken prisoner by Soviet soldiers in 1939 during the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign against <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Since <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in 1985, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have labeled the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre a `` blank spot'' _ a taboo or disputed issue _ in the two nations' histories. They have set up a joint commission of historians to investigate the killings. One Soviet historian, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Latshev </PERSON>, has been quoted as saying he saw evidence that Soviet bullets were found in bodies exhumed at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>. Many Poles were disappointed that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not mention the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre during a visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in July. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told reporters at a regular news briefing an official <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> delegation will witness the unveiling of a plaque at a `` memorial complex''' during a ceremony at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> on Thursday. `` A commemorative plaque will be set up there with the following inscription: ` A memorial complex to Polish officers who perished at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> and a monument to Soviet prisoners-of-war will be erected in this place,''' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. The Polish visitors plan to lay wreaths on the site, he said. The dedication of the plaque did not mean the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was accepting responsiblity for the massacre but that `` anyway, the time has come for a monument to be built there,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. On May 28, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported Soviet officials participated in a ceremony the day before at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> at a recently renovated monument to `` the Polish officers shot dead by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in 1941.'' The report went on to say that version of the massacre was being reconsidered. It was not clear whether the monument was part of the same complex to which <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> referred. He said in a telephone interview after the briefing he was unaware of the May ceremony at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> and believed the memorial complex was still under construction at that time. He said he did not know why the inscription on the monument, which specifically blames the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and gives a date for the massacre, differs from the one on the new plaque, which places no blame or date.

<HEAD>Portrait of Tito Used by Albanian as Weapon Against Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Albanian demonstrator used a portrait of the late President <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> to attack a policeman in a town in southern <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Tuesday. It said police arrested 13 of the estimated 200 Albanians who hurled stones at them in <LOCATION> Kumanovo </LOCATION>, 260 miles south of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, on Monday night. The demonstrators were protesting the introduction of compulsory bilingual education in secondary schools in the region, which belongs to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s southern republic of <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION>. The clash occurred after 500 ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON> gathered in front of the town hall and demanded that schools form separate classes in which the Macedonian language would not be used for ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON>, who are a minority. The authorities, who earlier this year disbanded such classes in favor of bilingual education, described the demonstrations as `` the work of Albanian nationalists and separatists.'' The protesters carried a portrait of <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> and shouted `` Better a grave than a slave!'' and `` We want freedom and justice!'' `` The perfidy and transparency of slogans used by the demonstrators was unmasked when a demonstrator attacked a policeman with the portrait of Comrade Tito,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>. Demonstrators in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> regularly invoke the name or carry portraits of <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, who is still venerated, as a moral shield against the security forces. The demonstration is one of the largest by ethnic Albanians since 1981, when at least nine people died in ethnic rioting in the neighboring province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where nearly 90 percent of the population is Albanian. The minority Slav population of the province has recently held a series of rallies demanding that authorities put a stop to what they describe as discrimination by Albanians, whose actions, they claim, are forcing them to move out of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>.

 Three men were shot and killed today a few miles from the site of an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing that left eight British soldiers dead and 27 injured. <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said without attribution that the three men _ apparently armed _ were believed to have been killed by British security forces.

He said the shootings occurred on the main road from <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Carrickmore </LOCATION>, a few miles from the place an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bomb blew up July 20 near a British army bus. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity. The bus bomb dealt the British army in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> its worst blow since 1982, and brought to 26 the military death toll in a summer of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province, mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. This morning, four mortar bombs and 25 pounds of explosives were found aboard a bus crossing the border from the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, police in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> said. The bombs and Czechoslovakian-made Semtex explosives were discovered on a bus owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Lough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a private bus service, when it was stopped and searched at a border checkpoint, a police spokesman said. They were found in luggage in the passenger compartment, said the spokesman, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the bus driver and passengers were being questioned but no arrests had been made. The discovery followed a weekend of bombings, shootings, riots and other violence in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION> which was sparked by the extradition from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> of a convicted guerrilla and jail escapee. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting to oust British troops from the province of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, led the violent protests over <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s extradition, police said. Security forces in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> have said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> received Semtex, a lightweight and difficult to detect explosive, in arms shipments from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has held discussions with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> about making it more difficult for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> to obtain Semtex.

<HEAD>U.S. Reasserts Opposition to Soviets' Krasnoyarsk Radar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator at the superpower Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty review conference on Tuesday reasserted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to the Soviet radar under construction at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, saying it violates the treaty. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also reiterated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's space-based missile defense program. The Soviets maintain that some research of the program, known officially as the Strategic Defense Initiative and popularly called `` Star Wars,'' violates the ABM treaty. In a speech to the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament, his first public comment since the treaty review conference began Aug. 24, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> referred only briefly to the dispute and did not break any new ground. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar `` is a significant violation of a central element of this treaty, and that measures must be taken to resolve this serious problem.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains the radar violates the 1972 treaty because it is not located on the periphery of the country, facing outward, as the treaty stipulates that missile-tracking radars must be. The ABM treaty restricts each side to deploying only one ABM system, comprising a radar and anti-ballistic missiles. The aim is to prevent either side from creating a full nationwide protective network, under the theory that neither side would launch a nuclear attack if it feared devastating retaliation. The two sides are holding their third review conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Under the treaty, such a review must be held every five years to allow both sides to air their grievances. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has charged that some `` Star Wars'' research violates the ABM treaty, though it has not made clear in public statements where it draws the line. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said the proposed system is not a bargaining chip. `` We will research it, test it, and, if it works, deploy it,'' he said. In his wide-ranging speech, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> also warned about the dangers of the nuclear weapons proliferation. `` It is indeed ironic that just when the two major nuclear weapon states have agreed to destroy their intermediate range nuclear forces, similar weapons systems appear to be spreading to other regions of the world,'' he said. The spread `` will only create new'' security problems, he said. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> also said the upcoming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election would not affect the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to the search for a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons, saying it is `` an enduring, bipartisan commitment.'' The Disarmament Conference has been trying to negotiate such a ban for about 19 years.

 Taxicab passengers headed for church can put an extra dollar in the collection plate _ or their pockets _ on Sundays thanks to a new fare discount approved by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. But they'd better be serious about praying. `` If it's abused, like if some people get out and walk around the back of the church, then the mayor said the rebates will stop,'' City Attorney <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> said Tuesday of the new $ 1-off-on-Sundays deal. The heavenly discount was offered last week by the city's only cab company, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, when it received approval for a rate increase, <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> said. At that time, council member <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> requested the discount for people who ride taxicabs to church because buses do n't run on Sundays in the central <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> city, the attorney said.

 Drunken drivers will have to pay for city services when they're arrested or cause an accident under an ordinance approved by <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is intended to act as a deterrent and recoup some city dollars from folks who drive impaired,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Creamer </PERSON>, who introduced the measure approved Monday night. The city ill bill drunken drivers for the cost of sending police, fire, rescue or city public service teams to an accident. Drivers who are stopped by police and found to be impaired by alcohol or drugs also will pay for being arrested. Those acquitted in court could get refunds. <PERSON> Creamer </PERSON> said state lawmakers and officials from several communities have called him to get more information about the ordinance.

<TEXT>
 Sandinista troops are patrolling in rural areas, undergoing intensive training and staying on the alert during a fragile cease-fire with Contra rebels. The government's combat units have spent time regrouping, and farmers in this combat area about 80 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> said they have been able to plant crops despite lingering tension. Each side has charged the other with violating the cease-fire during the five months it has been in effect, but the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> recognize their advantage. `` The Contras do n't have much of a possibility of major attacks,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Maj. <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasos </PERSON> in a recent interview in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Most of the Contras trying to overthrow the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have holed up in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and they are continuing to train new fighters and ask for weapons from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Each side says the other is planning for renewed combat, and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> recently charged both sides with preparing to renew the almost seven-year war. The 9-year-old Sandinista government and Contra leaders signed a cease-fire agreement March 23, three weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military aid to the rebels. Talks to define the pact, which called for democratic reforms and an end to rebel attacks, broke off June 9. Contra officials and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> estimate that some 2,000 rebels remain inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, mostly in the rugged northern mountains. Peasants in eastern <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION>, a northern province that has seen heavy combat during the war, said <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> rebels ambushed several civilian cars and military vehicles recently on the remote dirt roads. Many motorists venturing along the rutted 20-mile stretch from <LOCATION> Matiguas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanco </LOCATION>, a longtime <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> route, fly white flags to mark their neutrality while journeying through the area. `` This road runs along the Contra corridor to the north to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' a Sandinista military officer, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, said at the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanco </LOCATION> base overlooking steep hills. `` Here you ca n't say any road is safe.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the rebels, most in torn uniforms or civilian clothes, kidnapped more than a dozen civilians recently. In the town of <LOCATION> Matiguas </LOCATION>, several residents said the combat in the region was sharply reduced but that an air of tension remained. `` It's quiet by comparison,'' said farmer <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sequira </PERSON>. `` But we just wait and see.'' The farmer and government officials said the lull in the war meant many peasants planted crops this spring for the first time in several years. `` But we do n't know if we'll be able to reap the harvest,'' said <PERSON> Sequira </PERSON>. A series of informal talks started by Sandinista troops with <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> combatants ended in May. An army officer said the rebels responded to messages with bullets. Contra leader <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said recently the chats were `` part of a Sandinista trick to dismantle us one by one.'' Contra officials report that most of their forces fled during the past four months to tent camps in eastern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where more than 9,000 combatants are receiving U.S.-supplied food and uniforms. Rebel commanders said recently they are prepared to return to the battlefields in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> but needed weapons, denied by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since Feb. 29. Many are now armed with rusted Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifles. The Sandinistas, supplied by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, last year received $ 505 million in war supplies, according to the Pentagon. The Nicaraguan <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said shipments were arriving this year `` as usual,'' but declined to elaborate. Army troops, <PERSON> Pasos </PERSON> said in an interview, were moving into areas where Contra presence had been strong and were seeking civilian support by backing health and educational services. At rebel base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, Contra officials said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> are getting ready for an attack aimed at finishing the Contras once and for all. The Sandinista troops, <PERSON> Pasos </PERSON> said, were refining combat skills, looking at new tactics to counter Contra ambushes and staying in the field. `` Our combat troops are in position,'' Pasos said. Asked about any plans to reduce <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s 80,000-strong armed forces, the largest in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, she replied: `` For what? The war has n't ended.'' More than 26,000 people have been killed since the fighting started in 1981, a 18 months after the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> overthrew dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Brezhnev Son-In-Law Could Be Sentenced to Death, Spokesman Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The son-in-law of the late Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> could be sentenced to death if convicted next week of giving and accepting hundreds of thousands of rubles in bribes, a government spokesman said Tuesday. The trial of <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> and eight other former government officials starts Monday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and is expected to last 1 -LCB- to two months, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said at a regular news briefing. The group will be tried before the military collegium of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, and 200 witnesses are scheduled to testify, according to <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>. The investigation of <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> and the others has become a sensation in the press, which for more than a year have taken advantage of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, to report widespread corruption, nepotism and organized crime. The reports usually center around <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Galina </PERSON>, in 1971, and a crime racket with which he was allegedly involved in the republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> published a detailed report on the case Tuesday. Pravda described <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, appointed deputy interior minister in 1980, as a power-hungry man who used family connections for criminal purposes. It said he thrived during the rule of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who served as leader from 1964 until his death in 1982. `` A phenomenon of the stagnation years was the practice of making decisions in private about nomination of people to the highest positions, and a person was judged by his family status and the ability to please this or that clan, and not by his business qualities,'' the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency has reported that <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> is accused of accepting bribes totaling more than $ 1.1 million, equivalent to 270 years' pay for the average Soviet factory worker. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> could face execution by firing squad because he is charged with serious economic crimes. He noted that a new version of the criminal code being drafted would reduce the use of capital punishment for economic crimes, but that this change had not yet taken effect. Selected foreign reporters will be allowed to attend the first and final days of the trial, he said.

<TEXT>
 The redesigned space shuttle booster performed to near-perfection during a critical firing earlier this month despite being peppered with intentional flaws, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> announced Tuesday. `` It was as near perfect a test as you can imagine,'' spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. `` The test was so perfect that everyone associated with it has taken leave. Brother, there's nobody out at the plant.'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said workers had completed disassembly and primary analysis of the 126-foot-long solid-fuel booster tested Aug. 18 at <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> plant 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Success of the firing, the fifth and final qualifying test required before <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s redesigned booster is cleared for flight, was critical to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to resume shuttle missions, grounded since the Challenger disaster 2 -LCB- years ago <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> says it plans to launch the shuttle Discovery in late September or early October if sluggish oxygen valves and a hydrogen leak are repaired in time. <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> engineers have `` gotten all the primary results'' from their painstaking examination of the rocket. All that remains is mostly computer analysis of the `` more minor details'' of the test-firing, he said. Meantime at Space Center, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, the five Discovery astronauts and ground support teams began staging their final long-duration, pre-launch rehearsal Tuesday. The crew will face about 150 simulated problems during the lengthy test. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 20 million, two-minute test-firing culminated its efforts to redesign the booster, blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion. A presidential commission found that a faulty O-ring seal on one of the rocket's joints failed during launch, allowing super-hot gases to escape and ignite an exterior fuel tank. The Challenger and its seven-member crew were destroyed in the subsequent blast. For the Aug. 18 test, two of the rocket's three field joints, the case-to-nozzle joint and the igniter-to-case joint were peppered with 14 intentional flaws. One field joint was left unflawed for use in comparison.

 The chairman of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign said today that the Republican nominee was willing to have two debates with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and a third between their running mates, but a meeting between leaders of the two campaigns ended with no agreement on a set of face-to-face confrontations. Top officials of the two presidential campaigns met for nearly two hours with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, chairman of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, saying that they were willing to hold two debates with the first coming as early as Sept. 22, subject to agreement on a format and other considerations. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> and campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said after the meeting that the campaign would like additional presidential debates and that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign leaders had not agreed to specific dates and places for the debates. `` I believe that we will have debates, we will have more than one debate because it's in the best interest of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` we're not afraid'' of holding a third debate between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But he said, `` Debates have a way of freezing campaigns,'' and added, `` it's our view that a campaign is a continuing debate.'' The two sides agreed to continue negotiations on Thursday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the vice president's media adviser, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, and adviser <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> met privately with <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> offices of <LOCATION> Brountas </LOCATION>' prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Hale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Dorr </PERSON> law firm. The meeting came as the rhetoric escalated over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s delay in agreeing to a specific debate schedule. `` There will be an opportunity to debate, and I just do n't feel under any great rush, frankly,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said while campaigning in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` We might meet somebody halfway, but I'm not about to be stampeded.'' Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is using `` long-distance innuendo'' and `` transcontinental slurs'' while avoiding face-to-face debate. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, which has already accepted a bipartisan commission's plan for four debates, said the next move was up to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has been ducking these debates, and it's up to them,'' said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' communications director. `` We've got a plan, and it's a plan that's been agreed to by both parties. If they are n't willing to follow that plan, we've got to hear from them.'' <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, executive director of the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Presidential Debates, said she had been asked by each campaign to meet with them separately after the Baker-Brountas session. The commission set up the debates with the participation of both party chairmen. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that while the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has voiced a willingness in principle to debate, `` I do n't think they'd like more than the minimum number. My sense is they want two. We all know publicly the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> people want more than that.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said last week it was unlikely a debate could take place before Sept. 20 _ effectively ruling out the commission's first scheduled debate Sept. 14 in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and an even earlier proposal by the League of Women Voters. `` I see the statements that have been made recently as opening negotiating positions,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in a briefing for reporters. The League of Women Voters, sponsor of fall debates in the last three presidential elections, is pushing its own package of four debates. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, president of the league, said: `` We're definitely in the thick of it. Do n't count us out.'' The league's proposal is for a debate Sept. 8 in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. Other debates would be held Oct. 6 in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; Oct. 23 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; and Nov. 1 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> She said the debate in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home, would probably be for vice presidential candidates. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the commission could hold a first debate in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION> on a later date. But she said there were few fall evenings available that would not conflict with television network obligations to cover the World Series, the Summer Olympics and professional football. The commission wants other debates on Sept. 25 in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; Oct. 11 in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>.; and Oct. 27 in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> debate could be for the vice presidential candidates, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said.

In <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spain </ORGANIZATION> that he viewed the announcement as `` very good news.'' `` We expect this process to lead to the establishment of peace and prosperity in this region of great importance to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>,'' the minister said. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> expects to begin a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping operation in the region before the end of the year. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is considering sending about 2,000 peacekeeping troops to the remote, sparsely populated territory, authorities say. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> will also be appointing a special representative to supervise the peace process, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. The Aug. 11 peace plan includes the cease-fire and a referendum on the desert territory's independence or affiliation with another country, which would probably be <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. Details of the proposal have not been made public. Determining who is eligible to vote in the referendum is considered the chief sticking point. Moroccan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdellatif </PERSON> <PERSON> Filali </PERSON> said a referendum could be held `` in the relatively near future ... under good conditions'' but cautioned that his side is waiting for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> proposals on details of staging the vote. <PERSON> Bechir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustapha </PERSON>, Polisario's No. 2 man, said his side `` accepted the formulation of the question that will be put to voters'' in a referendum. Polisario agrees to consider a 1974 census, taken when the region was under Spanish control, `` as basis'' for counting Western Saharans, <PERSON> Mustapha </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mustapha </PERSON> said Polisario's main remaining concern is `` the future of the Moroccan administration and army,'' and that details of their retreat would have to be settled through negotiations. `` We have accepted with certain conditions,'' he said. The Organization of African Unity will have to play a major role in helping monitor a future accord along with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mustapha </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Filali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mustapha </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> their replies to his peace plan offering in separate meetings at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office. The two sides were given a deadline of Thursday to submit responses after meeting <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on Saturday for final clarifications on his plan. The <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> covers about 110,000 square miles but had only about 76,000 inhabitants in the last Spanish census in 1975. Most residents have fled to Moroccan-held cities or to refugee camps around the Algerian oasis of <LOCATION> Tindouf </LOCATION>. Polisario claims about 165,000 Western Saharans live around <LOCATION> Tindouf </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> says most of them are not Western Saharans. Polisario also claims that two-thirds of the 150,000 inhabitants of the Moroccan-held areas are immigrants not eligible to vote, but <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> asserts 90 percent are Western Saharans. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s army has kept Polisario from major gains, mainly by building a series of defensive walls in the desert. But <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s war effort has been costing up to $ 2 million a day in recent years.

 A mountain lion possibly intended as a religious sacrifice was rescued from a cage in a junkyard, a state official said Tuesday. The animal was found after an anonymous tipster said he was to take part in a rite of the Cuban-based religious cult Santeria, said Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffstodt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The caller said the mountain lion was being held in a cage in a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> junkyard. Wildlife Inspector <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, who checks zoos, pet stores and private residences to ensure wild animals are treated well, rushed to the site Monday. `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> found where somone was living, and found a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> mountain lion in very bad condition _ it had certainly been neglected,'' <PERSON> Huffstodt </PERSON> said. He said authorities did not know where the 50-pound female cat had come from. `` We are looking for the guy,'' said <PERSON> Huffstodt </PERSON>. The game commission took the mountain lion to a special camp in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> to be treated, <PERSON> Huffstodt </PERSON> said. Santeria is an Afro-Cuban religion created when <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> plantation owners taught their Roman Catholic beliefs to slaves, who then merged their native religion with Christianity. Practitioners seek favors or advice from their gods with such offerings as fruit, cigars, or sacrificing chickens, pigs or goats. Adherents say the animals are not mistreated before slaughter. Experts believe about 40 percent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Hispanic community, or about 1 million people, experiment in <LOCATION> Santeria </LOCATION>, and anthropologists estimate that related, similarly derived religions have 100 million followers in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Animal sacrifices by priests of the religion have caused protests in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but efforts to ban the practice have failed.

 Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should avoid gambling with its future by electing <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is `` another liberal governor coming out of nowhere.'' The vice president, who continued his strong defense theme of recent days, sought to depict his Democratic rival as inexperienced and weak on defense. During a tour of a Bendix defense plant, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` keeps the muscle of our defense strong,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee suggested that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> favors `` unilateral cuts in the muscle of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Later, as he addressed a $ 500-a-ticket party fund-raiser in a private residency, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that while he did n't `` want anything to do with tearing down'' the character of his Democratic rival, `` We should not gamble <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future on another liberal governor coming On Monday afternoon, the feisty, tough-talking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in high gear, firing up a college crowd at <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennesse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Murfreesboro </LOCATION>. He railed against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, accusing him of being weak on defense, soft on crime, in favor of new taxes and guilty of poor judgment and a `` liberal bias.'' Using an applause line that he has all but worn out since the Republican National Convention two weeks ago, he said that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ever tried to insist that as president he raise taxes, he would say, `` Read my lips _ no new taxes.'' When he went down to shake hands in the front of the outdoor rally of some 3,000 to 4,000, the crowd surged forward, hands reaching out excitedly. `` I thought that was good,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later told reporters when asked how he felt about the enthusiasm of his supporters. The combative and buoyant <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been delighting supporters in city after city since the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> GOP convention, as he speaks with a confident voice that seems to have been waiting until after the convention to project itself. His apparent ease with the new image stood in contrast with a Monday morning speech in which he slipped into his old low-key style addressing employees of a defense contracting plant near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. While some of the new rhetoric was there, the tone was more measured, recalling a style that was prominent in the primary campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, said that was because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to lay out substantive material on the differences between himself and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, mostly on defense. `` I think there will be times when he'll give more serious speeches, particularly when we move off of one set of issues into another,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. But for now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is having a good run with the more feisty style, which, coupled with improved standings in the polls, has him in a relaxed, good mood. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said the campaign has not conducted polling yet to see how the new tough image is working, but `` We've certainly noted a lot more enthusiasm in the crowds.'' `` Now that we're in this phase of the campaign it certainly helps to build up enthusiasm,'' he said. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said the campaign looked at the convention as `` designed to be a break with the past and the convention was an opportunity to move from being Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` As a candidate he's felt compelled to draw distinctions between himself and his opponent,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. And so <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has turned up the heat meter on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, sharpening his rhetoric and raising his voice as he tells audiences it's important to show the `` enormous differences'' in their positions Furthermore, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters on Monday morning, he does n't intend to be `` stampeded'' into conforming to a debate schedule favored by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` I say, ` Explain your views on defense,''' he said. `` The response is, ` How about debates?' _ totally irrelevant.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chairman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, was meeting today with his counterpart in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, to discuss the debate matter. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> for a one-day campaign trip. Campaigning at a defense plant near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> belittled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his opposition to a number of weapons systems. `` Sometimes he give me the impression he's against every new weapons system since the slingshot,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it did n't bother him a bit that he and running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> differ on some policy issues and that the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator did n't know <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed a presidential panel on drug interdiction. `` We're so much in sync on broad issues, you do n't expect everybody to be in agreement on every single ` t' being crossed or ` i' being dotted,'' he said when asked about positions he espouses that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> voted against in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Criticizes Killing of Political `Deviates'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has criticized the killing of political `` deviates'' in his country, saying the executions have given his revolution a bad name. In a speech broadcast on state television Monday night, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> also called for more political participation by Libyans and encouraged the development of black markets. The speech, delivered three days before the 19th anniversary of the coup that brought him to power, was addressed to a convention of revolutionary committee members. The committees are assigned with safeguarding the principles of his revolution. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said he was aware that people who had deviated from the course of the revolution had `` infiltrated'' some committees. He said they were deviant in `` conduct and opinion'' He noted that the committees took it upon themselves to execute only some of these deviates. This arbitrary reaction caused the `` masses to come to hate'' the revolutionary commitees, he said. According to the Arabic version of the speech by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said, `` We want the people to govern themselves.'' <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>'s official English version of the speech, which was delivered in Arabic, did not carry the criticism about the political executions. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> also declared that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s growing black market economy was a positive development that should be encouraged, calling it `` revolutionary,'' since it is want the people want. In the past year, more consumer goods began making their way into <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, especially after <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> eased restrictions with neighboring <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. Now many Libyans drive to the border and purchase goods such as clothing, batteries and American brand cigarettes and return to their cities to sell the goods on streetside stands or in the alleys of souks, or markets. About a year ago, <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s souk near <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> was virtually deserted, with the few goods for sale attracting few shoppers. The souk now is elbow to elbow with Libyans buying clothes, tapes of such pop artists as <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and Sting and jewelry and watches. Speaking about government, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> advised the committees to `` make the people govern themselves ... because it is in their interst.'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> also praised Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying he was the only man in the communist-Marxist movement `` who has the courage to lead the movement in this risky turn of Marxist history.'' In the French text of his speech, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> conceded that `` certain negative aspects, and even some mistakes'' had been connected with his revolution. But he said they were part of the `` necessary process of a sad period requiring the elimination of all obstacles to the power of the people.'' He also said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> needs to move a quarter of a million families from tents and slums to modern housing. `` A handful of people build palaces and millions of others live in slums,'' he was quoted as saying. `` As a result, the revolution has to remedy this situation.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Tuesday of violating its <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> pullout agreement by using Soviet-based airplanes in bombings against U.S.-backed guerrillas. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is also concerned about the redeployment of Soviet units in support of Afghan government forces fighting for control of the northern city of <LOCATION> Kanduz </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>. The Soviets, who withdrew their forces from <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> in recent weeks, returned with artillery and troops to bolster the government forces, she said. The Soviet troops initially were withdrawn from <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, about 30 miles from the Soviet border, as part of a 50-percent reduction of the Soviet presence, in compliance with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. The agreement, signed last April by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and co-guaranteed by both superpowers, calls for a total Soviet pullout by Feb. 15, 1989. The Soviets appear to be using airplanes based inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to carry out the aerial bombardments around <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> in support of the ground forces, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` In our view, the use of the Soviet aircraft coming from inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are a violation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Accords,'' she said. The redeployment of Soviet troops from other parts of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> is not viewed as violation, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> added. The pact which brings about an end to more than eight years of Soviet occupation is not in any danger of unraveling, she said. `` We fully expect the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to adhere to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords,'' she said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` raised the issue of Soviet compliance'' with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Good Offices Mission which monitors the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement. The Soviets, for their part, have complained to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> body about <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s continued arming of the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it will continue supplying <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> with weapons for the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> as long as the Soviets continue arming the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. The battle for <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> is viewed as a test of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> goverment's ability to overcome the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> once the Soviet pullout is completed. Some analysts believe the government will fall without its Soviet backers and the seven major <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> groups will vie for control of the country among themselves. Despite claims by the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government that it has wrested control of <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION>, the authorities have refused requests by Western reporters to visit the city, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. The government is flying five planeloads of food and ammunition into <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> daily to resupply its troops in the continuous fighting, she added. The Soviets are using artillery to back the government troops rather than committing any infantry to the battle, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. The Soviet involvement in <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> will likely be raised next week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at a meeting between Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> and Deputy Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the two men would meet Sept. 1 and 2 for their third discussion of regional issues in the past 18 months. Other areas on the agenda are the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, she said.

<HEAD>Bennett's Farewell Report: Elementary Schools Lack Good Curricula</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, in his final report as education secretary, said Tuesday that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> elementary school pupils need stronger doses of math, science and literary classics, as well as foreign languages starting in the fourth grade. Students are willing and teachers are `` for the most part good and capable,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, but too many schools suffer from defective curricula. At a news conference, he released a 61-page report, `` <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>: A Curriculum for American Students,'' summarizing his views of what should be taught to the 32 million youngsters enrolled in kindergarten through the eighth grade in 81,000 elementary and junior high schools. The report is a sequel to a model high school guide entitled `` <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>,'' which <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> wrote last year. He quipped that the latest report might be called `` <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he still believes, as he concluded in a 1986 report, that elementary schools are `` in pretty good shape'' and `` face fewer and less severe problems than now plague our high schools.'' By some measures, he said, achievement in the elementary grades stands `` at its highest level in three decades.'' But American youngsters still have an `` insufficient grasp of basic school subjects, and they lag well behind their foreign counterparts,'' he said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the culprits include: _ Dull texts that make reading a chore instead of a joy _ `` Dismal'' social studies courses that start teaching children about self-development when they are more interested in dinosaurs and space. _ Math courses that rely on drone-like, repetitive work books <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has no authority to require any school to adopt his ideas. By law, his department is barred from attempting to impose any curriculum on state and local school officials. `` I wish I had gone to <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sava </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>. To meet such a rich curriculum standard, <PERSON> Sava </PERSON> said, schools need better textbooks, better prepared teachers and more authority to manage their own affairs. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said his model is `` a statement of goals,'' not `` a monolithic program to be uniformly imposed or slavishly followed.'' He laid down a broad outline of topics to be covered in seven subjects: English, social studies, mathematics, science, foreign language, fine arts and physical and health education. His reading lists range from the tales of <LOCATION> Pippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Longstocking </LOCATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Piggle-Wiggle </PERSON> for the early grades to `` The Red Badge of Courage,'' `` Kon-Tiki'' and `` <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>'s Adventures in Wonderland'' for older pupils. `` Maybe a third of our schools are doing this or approaching this,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, but even some of those schools do n't offer an enriched curriculum to all their pupils. `` If there's a crucial point here, it's the fourth grade,'' he said. `` We see a fourth-grade slump in reading ... math and science.'' He said less than two-thirds of each school day is spent on academics. Even accounting for lunch and recess, he said, `` something like 20 percent ca n't be accounted for at all.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who is leaving his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post on Sept. 20, said his suggestions include American history in each of the first five grades, world history and geography in sixth and seventh grades, and world geography and American government in eighth grade. He would have all youngsters take either algebra or pre-algebra by eighth grade, biology in seventh grade and some chemistry and physics in eighth grade. Foreign language instruction should start no later than fourth grade, he said. The report profiles seven schools as models of strong elementary curricula. They are <ORGANIZATION> Meridith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magnet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Blaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Blaine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; School No. 59, Science Magnet, in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> LaSalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Language </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Maryette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stilwell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he will <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Wednesday Then he said he will speak Thursday on behalf of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is expected to discuss education. `` I want to bring a little sunlight to that discussion,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said.

 Talks between the government and Solidarity on solving <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s problems can begin as soon as <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> calls off a strike at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard, a government spokesman said today. In <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, senior Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> would hold talks Wednesday with Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and a representative of the Roman Catholic church. Other aides said there had been no immediate agreement to end the strikes that have swept <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for two weeks. `` The stoppage of strikes by Mr. <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the shipyard where he works would mean automatically convening a round table,'' chief government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> told reporters earlier in the day. Urban said there were no preconditions on what subjects could be discussed, adding: `` The starting of talks will be a common victory.'' <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> would mediate the round-table talks, Urban said. He declined to elaborate on other possible participants, but hinted the head of the official <ORGANIZATION> OPZZ </ORGANIZATION> union would be included. Wednesday is the eighth anniversary of accords signed in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> guaranteeing the right to free trade unions. Solidarity, once the only independent trade federation in the Soviet bloc, was outlawed following the imposition of martial law in 1981. If the talks do take place, they would be the first direct contact between <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and high government officials since he was interned after the martial law crackdown that crushed Solidarity. Round-table talks were proposed first Friday by <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, who said there would be no pre-conditions although he indicated the strikes must first end. Aides earlier quoted <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a founder of Solidarity, as saying he would not call for an end to the strikes without pledges that talks involve the issue of union pluralism. He also was quoted as saying he should take part as recognized chairman of Solidarity. Ten enterprises remained idled by work stoppages in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most serious wave of strikes since 1981 The work stoppages began Aug. 16. About 5,000 workers joined an occupation strike at a major southeastern steel mill on Monday after authorities attempted to reopen it, and talks between striking workers and management broke off at a coal mine and in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. During the peak of the unrest, about 20 enterprises employing 100,000 workers were idled. The week-old strike at the defense-related <ORGANIZATION> Stalowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wola </ORGANIZATION> mill in southeastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> swelled dramatically Monday when managers tried to reopen the 18,000-worker plant, strikers and authorities said. `` Strikers control a substantial part of the complex's territory,'' state radio said of the strike `` They control roads inside the plant. They check IDs of passing people who are not on strike.'' <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemczyk </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Solidarity information center in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, said the strikers demanded <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> negotiate on their behalf. Talks broke down at the July Manifesto coal mine, where the series of strikes began, after management refused to allow workers to speak to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> by telephone, according to Solidarity activist <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosiak </PERSON>. July Manifesto is in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION>, near the Czechoslovak border, and is the last of 12 coal mines still on strike. Its strike committee was `` waiting for <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s talks at the famous round table,'' <PERSON> Bosiak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Majka </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, on Sunday called <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> a `` possible participant'' in round-table national reconciliation talks. But he said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> could not be participate as the head of an illegal organization. In a statement spirited out of the strikebound Lenin shipyard in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he was ready to participate in talks but `` there must be compromise on both sides.'' `` I do not want to participate as a private individual. ... I stand behind Solidarity,'' he said, adding that the talks must take up the issue of trade union pluralism. The mediator between <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the government, <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, a law professor and head of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intellectuals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said it remained unclear whether the talks, endorsed by Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, would come about. `` The workers must decide if they wish to start the talks or not, because the government insists the strikes must end before the talks around the round table begin,'' <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON> said. `` The workers are hesitant, because of the risk, which is enormous,'' he said. <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON> said that although he felt there was good will on both sides, `` mistrust is so great ... that it is very difficult to put them together.'' He said there was no deadline for agreeing to talks, but some of the strikes were connected with military products and the government would not tolerate such stoppages indefinitely. Air Force Col. <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Laskowski </PERSON>, interviewed by state television, noted that <PERSON> Stalowa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wola </PERSON> is a defense industry plant serving <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and its socialist allies, and said no country in the world allowed strikes at such facilities. `` The situation can not tolerated ad infinitum,'' he said.

 `` The War of the Worlds,'' the story of a deadly invasion by Martians that terrified believing radio listeners 50 years ago, has been refought amid the serene hills of filmmaker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' Skywalker Ranch. The drama is coming back to national radio, but set in the present. On Sunday, Halloween Eve 1938, a startled nation listening to <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION>' Mercury Theater on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> radio heard what many assumed was live coverage of an invasion by monster aliens and their indestructible engines of war. Welles eventually announced that the broadcast, based on a science fiction story by H.G. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, was a Halloween prank, but <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' switchboards were swamped, and rumors of slimy, stalking death terrorized people who believed it was happening. `` Fake Radio War Stirs Terror Through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' cried a huge lead headline in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Daily News. Like the original, this 60-minute anniversary production will be presented nationally on Sunday, Oct. 30, on <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` We'll have disclaimers'' before the broadcast, said director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ossman </PERSON>. `` Of the creatures in the rocket cylinder I can give you no authoritative information,'' boomed the voice of <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION> in the role of astronomy Professor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON>, theorizing about what killed 40 people in the opening assault at the town of Grovers Mill, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. In the current production, set in the present, these same words are spoken to a clamoring news conference by actor <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards </PERSON>, playing <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON>. The cast also includes entertainer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> playing a network newsman broadcasting `` to the last'' and retired <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> newsman <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> commenting on the `` end of civilization.'' Real newapaper and television reporters who covered the production last weekend also wound up in the cast, playing reporters covering their `` last'' news story. While the original thriller was done with sound effects in a studio, the update is hi-tech, state-of-the-art. Half the production was recorded outdoors to get natural background sounds at the Lucas ranch in the summer-brown hills of <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. And unlike most radio drama, in which actors simply stand at microphones, the actors in this new production moved around as they would for film. The man behind this technique is sound designer <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, who won an Oscar for his work in `` The Right Stuff.'' But even without such techniques, the original broadcast was so realistic that some people contemplated suicide rather than die at the hands of the terrifying creatures. Others ran weeping through the streets and panicked callers clogged telephone lines to public safety offices. In the story, the Martians finally succumb, not to man's weapons of war but to germs. `` Later, when their bodies were examined in laboratories, it was found that they were killed by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared ... slain, after all man's defenses had failed, by the humblest thing that God in his wisdom put upon this earth,'' the original script read. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>, who co-produced the Welles show, has told of phones jangling off the wall in his control room `` and a shrill voice through the receiver announcing itself as the mayor of a -LRB- unnamed -RRB- ` big Midwestern city.''' <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> went on, `` choking with fury, he reported mobs in the streets of the city, women and children huddled in church, violence and looting ...'' The new production is funded by $ 100,000 in grants from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> McGavern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks HUD Sale Of Foreclosed Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge temporarily blocked the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday from selling foreclosed single-homes across the nation to the highest bidder. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said his temporary restraining order would remain in effect until Sept. 14 while Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON>, who has jurisdiction over the case, schedules further deliberation. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said, `` Clearly, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> did not comply with -LRB- housing laws -RRB-.'' He said challengers of the sales would `` likely be successful on the merits.'' He said his order would apply nationwide, but would not affect <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> sales previously entered into with buyers. The suit was brought by a coalition of advocates for the homeless as part of a broader effort to force the federal government to make the federal government's inventory of 47,000 foreclosed houses available to the homeless. <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagman </PERSON> <PERSON> Roisman </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, said the restraining order was sought because <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> planned to sign contracts to sell 170 homes in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D. C., metropolitan area on Wednesday. Last week, the project blocked <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> from selling 200 homes in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> accepted the project's arguments that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> had violated the Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, requiring <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to survey all federal buildings and properties to `` identify which ... are suitable to assist the homeless.'' The project also said the legislation stipulates that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> must then make properties in excess of the agency's need available to the homeless. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> also violated the National Housing Act, which calls for `` the realization as soon as feasible of the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family.'' `` We do n't want <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to sell off these units to speculators and investors,'' said <PERSON> Roisman </PERSON>. `` They have 47,000 units available. Even if they had 80,000, it would be a drop in the bucket. There are 800,000 families on a waiting list for housing around the country.'' <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, said there is no need for the court to block any house auctions. `` There is a continuing recycling of houses into and out of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inventory,'' he said. Under the restraining order, <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said, `` The houses will remain vacant. They will be the subject of vandalism and there will be a loss of property values, depending on the length of the suit.'' <PERSON> Roisman </PERSON> said the houses do not have to remain vacant because, in just the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area, there are 700 families with 2,500 children living in hotels and motels. `` They would be very happy to move into a home,'' she said.

<DATELINE>RAMSTEIN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said today six Americans were among those killed when three Italian jets collided at an air show, one hurtling into the crowd in flames. Two days after Sunday's disaster at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Air Base in <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, there were conflicting reports on the total number of dead. Late today, West German officials increased the death toll to 49, saying two of the injured died during the day. But the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said 40 deaths were confirmed. West German authorities said they have identified 14 of the dead. Many victims were burned beyond recognition in the accident, the world's worst air show crash involving spectators. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, chief <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said the latest count put the number of confirmed fatalities at 40, including six Americans, four Germans, three Italians and 27 people of unknown nationality. Of the six Americans, two were active-duty military personnel, three were dependents and one is unknown, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was trying to resolve conflicts in the casualty counts. The latest <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> count also shows 363 individuals injured, of whom 41 were American and 322 German, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Rhineland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palatinate </LOCATION> state where <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> is located, said many people suffered `` life-threatening injuries.'' Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> issued a statment saying four injured Americans were being flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The names of the four were not made public. <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Landstuhl </LOCATION>, said the Americans would be transported to <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on a medical evacuation flight. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military burn specialists from the medical center in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> examined 12 seriously burned Americans, including several children, at the hospital in <LOCATION> Landstuhl </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television said about 50 people were in critical condition. A memorial service for the victims will be held Saturday in <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vollmer </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Kaiserslautern </LOCATION> district government, said today. On Monday, the government banned acrobatic performances by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> warplanes and called for the suspension of all military air shows in the country. In addition, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> indicated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might ban stunt-flying exhibitions at air shows at its bases in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners suspended military air shows in this nation Monday `` until suggestions for effective measures are complete,'' said Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> also said he was permanently barring military stunt-flying exhibitions by West German military aircraft at air shows. `` I have made the decision that aerobatic flying can no longer be considered,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network Monday night. `` But it is obvious that I can make this decision only for the West German armed forces.'' Interviewed during the same program, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> indicated a similar <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action. `` We are very open-minded about whether there will be future aerobatic shows,'' <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will do all it can to make sure such a tragedy never happens again.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, commanding general of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, visited the crash site on Monday. `` We have absolutely no idea what went wrong,'' he said. Sunday's accident occurred as two formations of stunt-flying jets passed each other in a complicated maneuver about 180 feet above the airfield as about 300,000 people looked on. A solo jet coming from another direction was supposed to zoom by the two groups of planes as they passed at parallel levels, making it appear as if all three flight paths intersected. Instead, the solo jet collided with two of other nine planes. One plunged into a forest, another onto the runway. The solo jet hurtled into a crowd of thousands of people and exploded into a ball of flames. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, the Italian air force chief said the stunt team involved in the disaster will eliminate manuevers that fly over people and reduce the number of planes at other performances this year. Gen. <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Pisano </PERSON> ordered an investigation into the disaster involving the Tri-Color Arrows team.

 The body of a woman apparently beaten to death was under a motel bed for several days while customers used the room, police said Tuesday. On Sunday, a guest refused to use the room because of a smell. The body was discovered by a maintenance man on Monday. <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police Detective Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said the woman apparently was under the bed in Room 33 of the <ORGANIZATION> Oceanside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motel </ORGANIZATION> for several days.

The motel's assistant manager, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, said he checked the room Sunday _ but did not look in the enclosed space beneath the platform-type bed _ after a Saturday night customer complained of a smell. He said he did n't find anything but left the door open to air out the room. Police said they had not identified the dead woman.

<HEAD>Parliament Passes Tough Law on Journalists Who Write Defamatory
Stories</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parliament on Tuesday enacted legislation that could mean prison sentences of up to five years for journalists who write defamatory articles. Opposition leaders said the bill was motivated by a government dogged by corruption scandals. The Defamation Bill 1988, piloted by the federal government, was passed by a voice vote amid strong resistance from opposition political parties, Indian news agencies said. Members from opposition parties walked out to protest the bill they called `` draconian,'' and designed to `` muzzle the press,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency. A walkout is the strongest form of protest available in parliamentary procedure. The news agency said they objected to a clause that says, `` Where any matter which is grossly indecent or scurrilous or is intended for blackmail, is published in any newspaper, periodical or circular, the author of such matter and the printer, publisher and editor of such newspaper, periodical or circular shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term ... which may extend to five years.'' Opposition parliamentarians resisted the bill because it seeks to cover any imputation of criminal offence against an individual as aggravated defamation, <ORGANIZATION> PTI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Madhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dandavate </PERSON> said the government wanted the bill passed to protect itself from the scandals that have surfaced since 1987. Most allege that kickbacks from various defense purchases have been accepted by top government officers and officials of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> party. <PERSON> Dandavate </PERSON> said the bill was motivated by a government `` under the shadow of scandals.'' <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chidambaram </PERSON>, the minister of State for Home Affairs who introduced the bill Monday, denied the charge. He said the government did not intend to curb the press, but intended to ensure that a person's privacy and honor were not destroyed. `` I will defend until my death the right of newspapers to publish what is truth,'' he said. `` But the right must be to publish only the truth. Investigations by journalists must lead to facts and not to insinuations and innuendos.''

 A federal judge on Tuesday refused to allow <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> access to search warrants and other court documents used in the search of three homes in the government's Pentagon bribery investgation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Chief Judge <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> reversed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate who had decided in July to unseal some of the documents, but not others. `` It is apparent to this court that unsealing the search warrants and inventories would reveal much of the information in the applications and affidavits,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. The judge also said the three <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> men whose homes were searched were merely under investigation, not criminally charged, and thus had a right to privacy. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> had argued that information in the documents, if made public, could interfere with the continuing inquiry by government investigators and a grand jury in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Percival </PERSON>, attorney for the Post, said information in the warrants could have been passed on by the people whose homes were searched, since they had had the papers for two months. The documents pertain to the government's investigation of a senior <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> procurement officer and two private consultants. The newspaper challenged the sealing of the documents by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenkel </PERSON>, who then directed them to be made public July 18 but gave the government 10 days to appeal the decision. At the same time, <PERSON> Kenkel </PERSON> said the more sensitive affidavits used to support the request for the warrants could remain secret for 45 more days, a period that ends Thursday. <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> said during Tuesday's hearing that his office would ask <PERSON> Kenkel </PERSON> to extend the sealing of those documents. In his ruling, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kenkel </PERSON> was wrong to decide the search warrants and inventories of what was seized at the three homes should be unsealed, but that applications for the warrants and affidavits supporting them should not. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, noting that there was no disagreement that the information should eventually be made public, said the real dispute was over timing. He said all the documents should stay sealed the same amount of time.

<TEXT>
 Inch by inch, with the help of expert riggers, the funeral boat of one of ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s most powerful pharoahs took another journey Tuesday, to a new $ 2.2 million museum exhibit. Hydraulic jacks, dollies and a forklift were used to move the fragile, 3,847-year-old wooden boat about 50 yards from a display section of the Field Museum of Natural History to an exhibit designed to recreate a pharoah's tomb. `` It went very well,'' said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, a museum spokeswoman. Before the move, the 32-foot boat _ a graceful craft resembling a canoe _ was gently lifted off the floor and rotated so it was pointing south to its new destination, Mrs. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said. Riggers who performed the tricky maneuver had to keep their hands off, so no sweat or body oils would harm the ancient wood. The boat, used in the funeral of King Sen-wosret III in about 1850 B.C., now becomes part of a new permanent exhibit called `` Inside Ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>,'' which opens in November. The actual moving of the boat took about an hour, Mrs. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said. The ancient craft has been at the museum since 1900, and for at least a dozen years has been encased in glass in a room with other Egyptian artifacts. `` It was your typical museum collection,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said. The new exhibit will give visitors a feel for ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, though glass will still prevent any direct contact with the boat, she said. The exhibit will give visitors their only opportunity outside <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to enter and explore a life-size tomb complex, with two burial chambers, mummies and a shrine to the cat goddess <PERSON> Bastet </PERSON>, the museum said. King Sen-wosret's boat is among more than 1,000 artifacts to be displayed. Visitors will enter the tomb chambers of Unis-ankh, son of the 5th Dynasty pharaoh <PERSON> Unis </PERSON>. The chambers date to 2400 B.C. and were excavated at <LOCATION> Saqqara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, in 1908. Beneath a false door, a 35-foot burial shaft will take visitors into the dark burial chamber itself. The sarcophagus is empty. When the tomb was excavated, the mummy was gone, probably stolen by tomb robbers. Leaving the burial chamber, visitors will pass through a roughly hewn tomb robbers' tunnel and into a series of Egyptian burial scenes featuring dioramas, 23 mummies and other artifacts. `` It gives -LRB- visitors -RRB- a chance to explore the age-old mysteries of mummies and life after death,'' said the exhibit's developer, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamien </PERSON>. Sen-wosret's boat was one of four excavated in 1894 from his tomb at <LOCATION> Dashur </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMorgan </PERSON>, a Welsh Egyptologist, the museum said. Two are at the Egyptian Museum in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and the other is at the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. No one knows if Sen-wosret's boats were used to transport his body across the Nile to the burial site, or if they was buried near the tomb for use in the afterlife by the king's soul, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurco </PERSON>, a scholar on ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Oriental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and a consultant on the museum project. Sen-wosret conducted military campaigns that extended <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s boundary into the Nubian region of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, as well as securing control of the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to the south, he said He also centralized the government, setting the pattern for several hundred years. Sen-wosret is believed to have died when he was about 50, <PERSON> Yurco </PERSON> said.

 In the neighborhood where 82 people died two years ago after the collision of a jetliner and a small plane, few signs of the disaster remain. `` I'm surprised what another year has done. I think the neighborhood is fine now,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who once wanted to erect a plaque inmemory of those who died in the collision between an <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 and a light plane. At dawn Tuesday, homeowners watered carefully cut and edged lawns, cats scrapped in the street, a deliveryman plopped newspapers onto driveways and an occasional runner passed. `` It's been two years? If you did n't tell me, I would n't have remembered. I never think about. I do n't even remember that day,'' said <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON>, 47, as she completed her morning jog where wreckage once burned. On Aug. 31, 1986, a <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> with three people aboard collided in flight with the <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 carrying 64 people. The jetliner plunged into the neighborhood, exploded and killed another 15 people on the ground. Sixteen houses burned, 10 of them destroyed by flames or falling wreckage. There was nearly $ 3 million in damage. The <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> fell in front of a church. The jet fell and exploded, sending bodies and flaming debris raining to the ground as it cut a swath through the tidy suburb 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Now, there are only hints that tragedy once visited: A weed-infested lot on <LOCATION> Holmes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> where a house once stood, three 80-foot pines with fire-scorched trunks, several new, oversized homes. Where the smoldering airliner finally stopped, incinerating a modest $ 150,000 home, a five-bedroom, three-bathroom Spanish-style house is being sold for $ 485,000. Average home prices have nearly doubled since the crash. A new house alongside the <ORGANIZATION> Nelsons </ORGANIZATION>, whose home was clipped by the jetliner and set ablaze, was rented to a couple for $ 1,400 a month on the eve of the crash. `` We told people who looked at it that three people died here when the plane crashed,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON>, who manages the property. `` We feel that if someone has any apprehension we did n't want a tenant for a few weeks and have them vacate. `` Another year is all it took to get back with our lives and forget all about it,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, adding she has given up the idea of a neighborhood memorial plaque to honor the dead. `` We are forgetting.'' The memories were rekindled this week, however, by televised coverage of Sunday's air show crash at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The air show in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had a big impact on us. It brought memories back. As a matter of fact, I dreamed a plane crashed last night,'' she said. `` The wounds have healed for the most part. I'm surprised about that.'' But her son <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON>, 9, still wo n't get in an airplane. `` We went on another driving trip this year,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` I just have to get him on a plane so we can really get away.'' The sound of jetliners flying overhead does n't seem to bother anyone anymore. `` I do n't even think about it,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON>. Gone are the sightseers who cruised the neighborhood for a year afterward, averaging six carloads an hour on some weekends. `` For about the first year people came by a lot and it was annoying, but the sightseers do n't show up anymore,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Armenta </PERSON>, owner of a local barber shop. `` The customers bring it up once in a while, but everybody's pretty much gotten over it.'' A year ago, too, local ministers arranged a memorial service to remember the dead. There will be no service this year. `` The local clergy did n't plan anything this year. They are trying to put it behind them,'' said <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogle </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the city of <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION>. `` I would say it is typical of the majority of the community to forget. But I'm sure those people in the neighborhood will never forget.''

 An 18-year-old mother of three ordered to practice birth control throughout her child-bearing years is pregnant again, but the judge who sentenced her for child abuse says she wo n't revoke the probation. `` I have not been presented evidence that she is not in compliance with the court order,'' <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> said during a hearing Monday. She noted that no method of birth control was foolproof. `` Pregnancy does n't necessarily constitute a violation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> said. The judge sentenced <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> to lifetime probation last May 24 with the birth-control stipulation. The judge, who could have imposed a 30-year jail term, said it was the only way to make sure Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> did not have other children to abuse. Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>, who has appealed the sentence, pleaded guilty in April to two counts of attempted child abuse stemming from a May 1987 incident in which she left her sons, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, 1 -LCB-, and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 6 months, alone in a <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> apartment for three days. Authorities said the apartment had no air conditioning, and both babies were dehydrated and near death when found. The birth-control order attracted protests from such disparate groups as the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which proscribes birth control, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> said Monday she would not order Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> to have an abortion nor issue any abortion ruling. She also said she would rule by Friday on motions from <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s public defender, and the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> to modify the terms of probation and delete the birth-control requirement. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> attorney, <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, argued that the order was invasive, amounted to cruel and unusual punishment and violated freedom of religion for Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>, a Catholic. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>, a deputy county attorney, countered that the sentence served useful purposes in rehabilitating the defendant and protecting others. The judge learned in court of the new pregnancy _ Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s fourth _ from <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, who said it was confirmed last week The baby is due April 23, he said. He refused to say whether Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> was practicing birth control when she became pregnant. While awaiting trial this year, Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> gave up the rights to her sons and a daughter, who was born in jail. According to court records, all three have been adopted.

 The death toll in the worst crash at an air show rose to 49 Tuesday, and officials feared some children hospitalized with severe burns had been orphaned because no one had inquired about them. The Pentagon said six Americans were among those killed when three Italian jets collided Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, one hurtling into the crowd in flames. West German officials said two people died of burns Tuesday, raising their death toll to 49. They said 14 had been identified, including the three Italian pilots. None of the 14 was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. Chief Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> count put the number of confirmed fatalities at 40, including six Americans, four Germans, three Italians and 27 people of unknown nationality. Of the six Americans, two were active-duty military personnel, three were dependents and one is unknown, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was trying to resolve its conflicts in the casualty counts, he said. The latest <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> count also showed 363 individuals injured, of whom 41 were Americans and 322 were Germans, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. Four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> burn victims were flown to the <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, for further treatment. Surgeons and other medical staff took nearly an hour to move the blanket-covered patients from a military ambulance onto a C-141 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> transport plane. As the four were being loaded onto the transport, a fighter jet screamed overhead. The decision to move them from the <LOCATION> Landstuhl </LOCATION> hospital was made after the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> team headed by two surgeons examined them Monday and Tuesday. The West German Bild and Abendpost newspapers said at least three children had been hospitalized with serious burns but no one had inquired about them, leading to speculation their parents had been killed in the accident. In <LOCATION> Udine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the commander of the Italian stunt-flying team said that the team's soloist, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ivo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nutarelli </PERSON>, had caused the crash when he reached the point were the jets intersected too soon and too low. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Raineri </PERSON>, who was coordinating the team's movements from a control tower when the collision occurred, spoke to reporters shortly before the remains of the three pilots killed in the crash arrived home About 2,000 people were at the airport when the bodies arrived. Some Italian politicans called for a parliamentary investigation of the crash and for the resignation of the defense minister and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> commander. In downtown <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, about 100 members of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and their supporters took part in a vigil Tuesday evening. They expressed shock over the accident and called for a permanent ban on military air shows. `` The mood here has changed. Now they see the danger is a reality ... it has happened,'' said <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Schellanner </PERSON>, a local party spokeswoman. `` Before, when we warned about it, people did n't take it seriously _ they thought it was just a political thing. Authorities said they were being deluged with pleas from people seeking information on family members. <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON>, spokesman for the Rhineland Palatinate state government, said police had received more than 400 reports of missing people following Sunday's disaster. He said some people were listed in more than one report. `` There are even cases of people from as far away as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who have said ` My relative has been on vacation there for three weeks, and we have n't heard a word. Is it possible they were at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>?''' said <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television showed pictures of a special missing persons bureau set up after the disaster in the town of <LOCATION> Kaiserslautern </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>. `` I'm looking for my sister,'' said a German man whose name was not given. `` The whole family did n't come home.' Officials said that of the 282 people still hospitalized, about 20 to 30 were so badly burned and disfigured that they also were in danger of dying. The Bild newspaper said authorities have searched in vain for the parents of two badly burned girls _ 6-year-old <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> and 10-year-old <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> _ who are being treated at a hospital in <LOCATION> Oggersheim </LOCATION>. `` Their faces and their bodies are burned _ 70 percent _ and their hair is singed,'' the newspaper reported. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> quoted head surgeon Dr. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Zellner </PERSON> as saying it was possible the parents of both girls were dead since no one inquired about them. One young boy thought to be about 13 with burns on 95 percent of his body has still not been identified because he is in deep shock, the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Abendpost newspaper said. The boy has not regained consciousness since he was brought to the Offenbach hospital near <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> `` and no one has asked about him,'' Dr. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Avalos </PERSON> was quoted as saying, adding it was suspected his parents were dead.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has agreed to resume cooperating with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on accounting for the more than 1,700 American military personnel still missing in the Vietnam War, ending a boycott that lasted less than a month, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday.

She said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team also will visit <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on Sept. 5-8 to discuss a plan to allow private American organizations to treat Vietnamese with war-related disabilities. On Aug. 3, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> suspended cooperation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the accounting effort. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> said his government was retaliating against a `` hostile policy'' the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was pursuing against <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. His statement was prompted by testimony in late July in which Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> reaffirmed the longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of maintaining diplomatic distance from <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> until its troops are withdrawn from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has agreed to discuss humanitarian issues with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> but says there can be no trade or diplomatic relations between the two countries until the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> issue is resolved. <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was opposed to a proposal by several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to establish a small <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic mission in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has not agreeed to resume discussions on resettlement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of former political detainees who were associated with the former U.S.-backed government in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>. She expressed disappointment there will be no discussions on that issue but said the administration hopes the two September meetings `` will initiate a period of increased cooperation on all humanitarian issues of mutual interest.''

 Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said Tuesday that his country would make no concessions to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as peace talks to end their 8-year-old war remained stalled for a fourth day. `` That is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s dream ... but if they could n't get any concessions during this long war with so many casualties, of course they will not be able to get any concessions or anything beyond their legal rights during the peace talks,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, who is conducting the negotiations between <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and his <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> counterpart <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, said the talks were stalled over immediate troop withdrawal and freedom of navigation. `` We are trying to clear the first part -LRB- of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace resolution -RRB- on an immediate cease-fire and a troop withdrawal without delay ... the cease-fire at sea is part of the problem,'' he said on arrival at the Palais des Nations. Formal talks have been suspended since Friday, and low-level talks have been held without the participation of <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> told an evening news briefing that technical experts from the two delegations continued to work at the Palais, but a top-level meeting was not planned. `` If there is a formula, then there will be a -LRB- top level -RRB- meeting,'' he said. The secretary-general met Monday with the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ to discuss how to get the talks going again. In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, spiritual leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> declared Tuesday that the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was not over yet. He accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of plotting against his country, official <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported. The radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> urged Iranians to man the front lines but also called for a national effort in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s post-war reconstruction The 88-year-old religious patriarch, who said last month that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution was `` more deadly to me than poison,'' declared: `` We must not take it that the war has ended.'' `` Our enemy, be it big enemies such as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or their surrogates such as -LRB- <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President -RRB- <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> -RRB- and others, are constantly plotting because they have seen how <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> has become a major force in the world,'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> blamed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for blocking the peace talks. `` The main problem is the raising of new preconditions by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>,'' he said. He said the preconditions included a demand for the immediate clearing of the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the sea, and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s unilateral abrogation of the 1975 <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> treaty. The treaty places the border between the two countries down the middle of the waterway. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> demands full sovereignty over the waterway. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was `` facing a lot of internal difficulties because people ask them, why did you start this 8-year-old war, for what reason?'' `` We think this is the main reason they are looking for some advantage, some concessions,'' he said. The Shatt-al-Arab has been blocked by sunken ships since the outbreak of the war. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said Monday the waterway should be cleared as soon as possible to balance the advantage gained by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> stopped attacks on Iranian shipping under the terms of an Aug. 20 cease-fire. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> also complained of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s continued searches of Iraqi-bound vessels in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said the clearing of the Shatt-al-Arab should come `` at an appropriate time, after all the provisions of the cease-fire have bneen implemented.'' `` We do not think that a deadlock has been reached,'' the Iranian minister said. `` We do hope that the secretary-general can find a solution for such difficulties.'' He said he would remain in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> `` as long as the secretary-general will be here and asks us to remain here.'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> made a similar declaration the previous day.

<HEAD>Out-of-Court Settlement Reached IN Jackson Video Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former presidential hopeful <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has reached an out-of-court settlement with a company that sold thousands of videotapes of his address to the Democratic National Convention, attorneys said Tuesday. `` Yes, there has been a settlement,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an attorney for MPI Home Video. `` But I believe the terms are confidential.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, also refused to discuss the agreement, and both sides refused to say whether it would allow the sale or distribution of more MPI tapes of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s speech. `` The parties have reached an agreement in principle,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. `` We hope to wrap it up in the next 10 days or so.'' The settlement avoided a trial, which had been scheduled to begin Tuesday, over whether <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION> had the right to profit from tapes of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s July 19 speech in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION> sold about 7,500 of the videotapes, at $ 14.95 each, before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON>'s temporary order July 29 brought a halt to the sales, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Breisblatt </PERSON>, another attorney for Oak Forest-based MPI. <PERSON> Breisblatt </PERSON> said he did not know exactly how long the videotapes had been on sale before then, but he estimated it was less than week. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s camp, which had gone to court to block the sales, was pleased with the settlement. <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION> had contended that the black leader's speech was news and unprotected by copyright law. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> argued that the videotapes exploited his name as well as his literary and oratorical skills. He testified at an earlier hearing that <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION>'s tape, which he did not authorize, hurt his livelihood by limiting the marketability of a videotape of the speech that he planned to sell. <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON>, in his order halting the sales, agreed. `` There is ... more than negligible probability that -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- earns part of his living ... on his oratory,'' the judge said.

 Two Soviet MiG-29s did an impromptu aerobatic display as they arrived in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Tuesday for their first public display in the West at an air show next week. Two British Tornado F3s intercepted the newest Soviet fighters 100 miles out over the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and escorted them to <LOCATION> Farnborough </LOCATION> in tight formation. The Tornados then peeled off to allow the Soviets to carry out their short display before landing.

<HEAD>Pilots' Bodies Return To Italy, Commander Discusses Tragedy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UDINE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The soloist for the Italian air force stunt team caused the fatal crash at the West German air show when he arrived too low and too soon at the point where the jets intersected, his commander said Tuesday. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Raineri </PERSON> spoke to reporters shortly before the remains of the three pilots killed in the crash Sunday at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, arrived at the airport. About 2,000 people were at the airport when the bodies arrived. Defense Minister <PERSON> Valerio </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanone </PERSON> will attend the funeral Wednesday for the pilots identified as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Naldini </PERSON>, 38; the soloist, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ivo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nutarelli </PERSON>, 41; and Capt. <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alessio </PERSON>, 31, who was the youngest member of the team. `` It is easy enough to tell what happened,'' said <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON>, who as commader was coordinating the team's manuevers by radio from the ground at the time of the collision that sent one plane hurtling into the crowd. `` The first section of the formation flew in one direction and the soloist came in from 90 degrees, colliding with two planes,'' he said. Two of the three other planes in that group were damaged, he said. `` I was the only one -LRB- team member -RRB- to see the tragedy, but I do n't understand what happened. The soloist came in early on the rest of the formation and at the same altitude,'' <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON> said. `` The other section, composed of four planes, did not know what happened until the end of the manuever when the pilots saw the wreckage and the smoke on the runway,'' he said. Some Italian politicans called for a parliamentary investigation of the crash, called for the resignation of the defense minister and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> commander, and criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to allow the team to continue its performances this year `` The decision of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to continue the next exhibitions of the national aerobatic team seems like an offense in front of the victims, the hundreds of injured at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> and the pilots that died in the accident,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> party Deputies <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Filippini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giancarlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvoldi </PERSON>. The two said they would demand an urgent meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> to debate the tragedy. Deputy <PERSON> Flaminio </PERSON> <PERSON> Piccoli </PERSON>, a member of the dominant <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and the president of the chamber's foreign committee, criticized the risks `` to the lives of the exceptional pilots and to the lives of the citizens and spectators'' and said it was necessary for the government and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the tragedy. The organizers of an air show Satuday in <LOCATION> Fribourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, announced they have asked the Italian team to withdraw because of the accident at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>. They said the request was to show respect for the dead pilots and because the crash investigation is still underway. Also on Tuesday, organizers canceled a Sept. 11 air show in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON>, during his impromptu news conference, defended the decision to continue performances by the team this year. `` An experience like <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> can not be erased from the memory, but the motivation to do our work has not changed very much,'' he said. `` The time to reconstruct the unit decimated by the accident will be months, probably years. We were the best in the world.''

<HEAD>US, Soviets Verify Claims of Each Medium-Range Nuclear Arsenal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have completed initial, 60-day inspections under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty detecting any apparent discrepancies in their claimed arsenals, defense sources said Tuesday. `` The numbers matched,'' said one Pentagon official, referring to the number of nuclear missiles stored at various military installations inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries. `` And they verified our numbers, too.'' The first 60 days of compliance with the treaty signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last December ended Monday when the superpowers completed all authorized inspections. The so-called baseline inspections were intended to allow each country to verify the number and location of medium-range and shorter range nuclear weapons in each arsenal before their destruction begins under the INF treaty. American inspectors had to visit 133 Soviet weapons facilities at 115 locations during the two-month period. The Soviets had to inspect 31 facilities at 26 sites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The treaty, which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratified earlier this summer, calls for the elimination within three years of all American and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles. The treaty covers 859 nuclear-armed missiles on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side, compared with 1,831 on the Soviet side. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> refused to discuss details of the inspections Tuesday but told reporters: `` I have not seen any reports of problems with regard to the baseline inspections.'' `` We completed our baseline inspections and they completed theirs,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s on-site inspection agency `` The Soviets were very flexible, very professional and very knowledgeable about the treaty, which facilitated our inspections,'' <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said. `` Both sides knew the terms of the treaty and worked in a professional manner together.'' Under the treaty, both sides next will be entitled to conduct 20 short-notice inspections over the next year at selected military facilities. In addition, permanent inspection teams are on duty at Soviet and American missile plants to guard against cheating, and inspectors from both countries will be able to observe the actual destruction of missiles. The Soviets are now operating `` elimination'' _ or destruction _ programs for missiles and launchers at five different sites, <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said. In addition, the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION> plan within the next week or two to begin destroying up to 100 SS-20 missiles by launching them without their warheads. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will begin destroying the medium-range missiles in its arsenal on Sept. 8 by firing some solid-fuel rockets used in Pershing II missiles at the <ORGANIZATION> Longhorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Conservationist Attacks Kenyan Ministry Over Animal Poaching</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Conservationist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> accused a government ministry of providing little more than `` lip service'' to stop widespread poaching that has claimed 93 elephants since April, it was reported Tuesday. `` It is a national crisis,'' The Standard quoted <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, as saying Monday. He said high-ranking people, whom he did not identify, were involved in the poaching. He described it as `` economic sabotage with far-reaching and lasting effects on the posterity, stability and success of our country.'' <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> also challenged <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhoho </PERSON>, minister of tourism and wildlife, to prove his claim that 22,000 elephants remain in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. `` We may have less than half that number in reality at this time,'' said <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>. `` Until a proper census is carried out, the figure of 22,000 should be taken with caution.'' <PERSON> Muhoho </PERSON> cited the 22,000 figure Monday when he reported to a meeting of ornithologists that in the last four months poachers had killed 92 elephants in several game parks, The Standard and <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>'s other two English-language papers, <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>, reported Tuesday. Studies by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Environmental Program show that in the last 15 years, elephant populations have dropped 85 percent in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and that herds in <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> have been similarly depleted. An aerial survey in February of the vast <ORGANIZATION> Tsavo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> found 5,363 elephants, down from an estimated 35,000 in that park alone in 1974. An all-time high ivory price is fueling the slaughter, according to experts who say poaching will not abate until the illegal trade is halted. <PERSON> Muhoho </PERSON> said the government was trying to combat the animal slaughter by `` increasing manpower, training and equipment available to rangers.'' But <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> said rangers were equipped with inadequate weapons against well-armed poachers and were seriously hindered by impassable roads, broken-down vehicles and inadequate fuel supplies. `` The minister and his officers are urged to do more than give lip service to the growing crisis,'' said <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, brother of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s only white parliamentarian, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, and son of noted paleontologists <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>.

 A man suspected in 60 rapes pleaded innocent Tuesday to a 21-count indictment charging him with raping and kidnapping five women and assaulting a sixth. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Biddings </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, appeared handcuffed before <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Reda </PERSON>. No trial date was set. Biddings, a former restaurant dishwasher, was indicted Friday for allegedly abducting his victims, who included a 12-year-old girl, handcuffing and raping them from 1986 to March 1988. He was arrested after the parents of a 24-year-old rape victim spent more than a year pursuring her attacker. The victim's mother stood at the same east-side bus stop where her daughter was attacked in June 1987 and acted as a decoy while her armed husband waited nearby. The woman was attacked on Aug. 5, but her husband scared off the assailant and gave police the license number of the attacker's vehicle Biddings was arrested three days later. Biddings is suspected of being the `` handcuff rapist,'' a term that refers to the use of handcuffs in early attacks and later was attributed to the same man over four years. The indictment said Biddings had been convicted of rape in <LOCATION> Summit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1973 and served a jail term on the charge. In all, he was indicted on 12 counts of rape, six counts of kidnapping, two counts of aggravated robbery and one count of felonious assault. Two of Biddings' sisters were in the courtroom Tuesday but refused to talk to reporters after the hearing. `` They're upset,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Erlenbach </PERSON>, Bidding's attorney. `` But they're sticking by him.'' Biddings himself is upset by the charges, because he does not understand the terminology in the indictments, said <PERSON> Erlenbach </PERSON>, who was hired by the defendant's family. `` He does not understand a lot about it,'' he said. `` But he has maintained his innocence to me all along.'' County Prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said last week he expects more indictments against Biddings and that he would present further evidence to the grand jury this week. Biddings is being held in lieu of $ 750,000 bond. Meanwhile, the 24-year-old victim urged other rape victims to report their complaints. `` I want victims to know that they have to come forward. That's the only reason I'm talking about this right now They have to come forward,'' the woman said in a copyright story in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> She told the newspaper she has agreed with police not to discuss specifics of the attack until after Biddings is tried.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Orders Cross To Be Removed From Hawaiian Base</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 65-foot tall Latin cross erected 22 years ago at a Marine base in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> must be removed or replaced by a nonreligious symbol, a federal judge ruled Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said the cross, which was lit nightly at Camp <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in the suburbs of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, appears to be an unconstitutional endorsement of religion by government. `` The principal symbol of Christianity, this nation's dominant religion, is too laden with religious meaning to be appropriate for a government memorial assertedly free of any religious message,'' wrote <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>. `` While the court is unwilling to say that a Latin cross is ipso facto -LRB- by the fact or act itself -RRB- unconstitutional, it is constrained to find its use inappropriate in this case.'' However, <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said his order would not go into force for 60 days to give the government an opportunity to seek a further stay from an appellate court while it appeals his decision. The Jewish War Veterans of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> contended in its suit that the wooden cross on a prominent point at the Marine base violated the Constitution's ban on governmental endorsement of a particular religion. Origin of the cross was disputed during the trial. According to one account, the cross was built in April, 1966, for Eastern sunrise services to which the public was invited. A former commanding general of the <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krulak </PERSON>, said it was built to serve the purely secular purpose of honoring Marines killed or missing in action in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> noted the Constitution prohibits <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from making any laws respecting an establishment of religion. But the Establishment Clause `` is not an easy area of the law,'' he said. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said a single thread runs through decisions by federal courts: that the Latin cross _ one whose base stem is longer than the other three arms _ `` is a readily indentifiable symbol of Christianity.'' `` The 65-foot lighted cross on <LOCATION> Bordelon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> at Camp Smith may fairly be considered to convey a message of governmental endorsement of Christianity,'' the judge wrote.. `` The use of a cross as a memorial to fallen or missing servicemen is a use of what to some is a religious symbol where a nonreligious one likely would have done as well,'' said <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>

<HEAD>Farm Prices Up 2.1 Percent In Month, 13 Percent In Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Prices farmers got for raw products in August rose 2.1 percent from July, boosted in part by the momentum of this year's drought, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Compared with a year earlier, August prices averaged 13 percent higher. The report also included revised figures showing that the index roseonly 2.9 percent in July, compared with the preliminary reading of 3.6 percent announced a month ago. Since April, as drought cut into this year's harvest prospects, farm commodity prices overall have climbed 10.8 percent, according to the latest figures. But there were signs that the upward spiral of some commodity prices were beginning to level off in August. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its preliminary report that higher prices for cattle, apples, tomatoes and lettuce contributed most to the August increase, while prices declined for cotton, corn, onions and soybeans. In the earlier months, corn and soybeans helped lead the way for rising prices. However, by late July, widespread rains began to dampen further increases, although the drought of 1988 has not been broken by any means. At the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday grain and soybean futures closed sharply higher, but it was on the strength of new export business, not further crop losses due to drought, analysts said. Moreover, they said, the corn and soybean crops have passed their most critical stages of development. Based on Aug. 1 estimates, this year's corn harvest may drop 37 percent from 1987; wheat, 13 percent; and soybeans 23 percent. `` All feed grain and soybean prices declined from July, but rough -LRB- unmilled -RRB- rice and all wheat prices increased slightly,'' the report said. `` Average prices of beef cattle and calves increased sharply from July but were below the high levels recorded during February through May of this year.'' Prices of some major commodities are based on mid-month averages and then are revised the following month when additional information is available. As a commodity group, prices of feed grains and hay dropped 2.8 percent from July to August, averaging 68 percent above a year ago, the report said. Prices of meat animals rose 4.3 percent as a group but averaged 0.6 percent below the year-earlier mark. Beef cattle prices averaged $ 66.40 per 100 pounds of liveweight, up $ 3.20 from July. Hog prices increased $ 1 from July to $ 46.80 in August. Apple prices at the farm level, rose to 26.1 cents per pound in August from 19.7 cents in July and 16 cents a year ago. Lettuce was reported at $ 12.20 per 100 pounds, up from $ 7.62 in July but far below the $ 18 of last year. Tomatoes, at $ 41.70 per 100 pounds, were up from $ 31 in July and $ 17.30 in August 1987. Overall, the August all-crops price index was up 2.3 percent from July, averaging 33 percent above the year-ago level. The August price index for all livestock and livestock products was up 3.4 percent from July and averaged 1.3 percent more than a year earlier. Higher prices for cattle, hogs, milk, turkeys and eggs accounted for the increase from July. Although the projections are subject to change, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $ 55 billion to $ 60 billion this year, compared with the record level of $ 57.1 billion in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts and cash expenses during the calendar year. Consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987. Before the drought took hold, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> was predicting a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent. Department officials have predicted that the drought may add 2 percentage points to food prices in 1989, above the expected increase in inflation, currently forecast at around 4 percent. That could mean a 1989 food prices increase in the range of 6 percent to 7 percent. The report did not include new figures showing what farmers pay to meet expenses. Those are reported quarterly, and the most recent figures released in July showed farm production costs were up 2.4 percent from April, averaging 4.9 percent more than in July 1987. The report said: _ Cattle averaged $ 66.40 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $ 63.20 in July and $ 61.90 reported for August 1987 Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef. _ Hogs averaged $ 45.40 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 44.10 in July and $ 58.60 a year earlier _ Corn, at $ 2.66 a bushel, was down from $ 2.72 in July and the average of $ 1.47 per bushel a year earlier _ Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures, averaged $ 3.56 per bushel, compared with $ 3.50 in July and $ 2.36 a year earlier _ Rice averaged $ 7.61 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 7.51 in July and $ 3.74 a year earlier _ Soybeans were $ 8.40 per bushel, compared with $ 8.50 in July and $ 5.02 a year earlier _ Upland cotton was reported at 55.2 cents per pound, compared with 58.6 in July and 63.7 cents in August 1987 _ Eggs were 59.9 cents per dozen, compared with 62.2 cents in July and 51.9 cents a year earlier _ Milk was $ 11.60 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 11.40 in July and $ 12.20 a year earlier _ Broilers were 41.9 cents per pound, live weight, compared with 42.1 cents in July and 31.7 cents a year ago

 <LOCATION> RUNDU </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Fifty army vehicles rumbled across a pontoon bridge Tuesday carrying the last South African troops out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where they spent more than a year fighting in support of anti-Marxist guerrillas. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleeson </PERSON>, said at a ceremony that nearly 1,000 soldiers crossed into <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> during the day to complete the first phase of a U.S.-mediated regional peace initiative. `` As of this moment, we are out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gleeson </PERSON> said. The peace effort is aimed at ending a 13-year-old war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, whose Marxist government is backed by thousands of Cuban troops. After a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says it will grant independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. An estimated 2,500 South African troops, some of them 180 miles inside in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, have been leaving in stages since a cease-fire was declared Aug. 8. They supported the National Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, also backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is not party to the cease-fire and was exclued from recent peace talks between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediation. The four countries involved in the negotiations met last week in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, but failed to agree on timetables for withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and Namibian independence. More talks are planned for <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> next week. <PERSON> Gleeson </PERSON> said there were no truce violations. But later a senior official of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> complained Cuban forces were put on `` red alert'' during the withdrawal. `` This is hardly the action of an army sure of itself or one aiming at peace, but rather one aiming for a return to hostilities,'' said the diplomat, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Babb </PERSON>. South African and foreign journalists were flown to <LOCATION> Rundu </LOCATION>, on the Angolan border, to witness the completion of the withdrawal by South African forces, which have been inside <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since early 1987. Cuban and Angolan officers serving on a cease-fire monitoring committee also attended the ceremony while soldiers dismantled the bridge across the <LOCATION> Okavango </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` Our governments have shown the world that we will pursue peace,'' said Angolan Maj. <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON>. `` We hope to continue in the spirit of mutual understanding and sincerity.'' The South African trucks crossing into <LOCATION> Rundu </LOCATION> carried troops and supplies, and some towed giant G-5 long-range cannon across the shallow river while villagers washed their clothes nearby. Many of the vehicles had graffiti on them, such as `` No retreat, no surrender'' and `` Hello, mom.'' They drove into a compound that had a banner that said `` Welcome, winners.'' <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is to try to keep guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> at least 150 miles north of the Namibian border, <PERSON> Gleeson </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has said it will observe a cease-fire starting Sept. 1 but has n't commented on whether its guerrillas will move away from the border area. <PERSON> Gleeson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will not conduct any more `` hot pursuit'' raids into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> units. The Cubans reportedly have been offering to leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 24 months, apparently still too slow for the South Africans. `` We are not in a rush'' to leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, said Cuban Col. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rundu </LOCATION>. `` We are aiming to accomplish the tasks of our government.'' <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s often-stated goal is to ensure the survival of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s government A hasty Cuban withdrawal could leave the government vulnerable to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, which controls about one-third of the country. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has intervened in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> regularly since 1975 when it invaded the country on the eve of Angolan independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. South African generals said their maximum strength in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> was 3,000 men, although other reports claimed the force was twice that size during battles last October. News reports monitored in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, on Tuesday said Angolan government soldiers clashed last week with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels. Rebels killed eight people traveling in a bus belonging to the international humanitarian organization CARITAS on Thursday, the official Angolan news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement also released in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, said it killed 10 government soldiers and captured two others in three separate clashes Friday and Saturday. The statement gave rebel casualties as four killed and 11 wounded. The Portuguese news agency <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> added that 20 other Angolans were killed in three other rebel ambushes in recent days.

 Rustlers who stole a little metal calf did n't get far before a posse corralled them at the main gate of <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. The calf is the smallest member of the popular `` Herd of Cows'' sculpture grazing near a fire station in this west <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city. Valued at $ 1,000, the calf was n't easy to steal. It was anchored into concrete with large bolts that apparently were ripped loose. The calf's left front ankle was bent, possibly during the theft Monday. Two airmen were charged with third-degree felony theft, police said Tuesday. The men, who posted $ 5,000 bail each, were <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmondson </PERSON>, 22, whose hometown was not known.

A witness noted the truck's license number and gave it to police, who forwarded the number to the main gate at the air base. Military police stopped a pickup when it tried to drive onto the base, <PERSON> Portalatin </PERSON> said. `` Lo and behold, there was a cow in it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A nuclear weapon was detonated Tuesday at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site, 13 days after Soviet scientists monitored another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> test at the same site in a historic breakthrough in international relations. Two Soviet scientists were still on site at the time of Tuesday's blast, but were not involved in monitoring the test. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists are in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and will monitor a test there Sept. 14. Tuesday's test measured 4.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION>. The test, code-named Bullfrog, was conducted at 11 a.m. PDT and produced a `` very distinct rocking motion'' in a control center 10 miles from ground zero, according to <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoerg </PERSON>. The test was not pre-announced, as are larger tests at the desert site. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the shot had an explosive force of less than 150 kilotons, the limit under treaties signed in 1974 and 1976. The device was buried in a 1,600-foot shaft at <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION>, 85 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. It was the 10th announced shot this year and the 685th announced since testing began in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> in January 1951. The most recent previous test was Kearsarge, which was monitored by Soviet scientists as part of tests aimed at developing a method of confirming treaty compliance. Tuesday's test was conducted by <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> <PERSON> Laboratory </PERSON> and was weapons related, Ms. <PERSON> Yoerg </PERSON> said. She said three protesters were at the gates of the sprawling desert site when the test was conducted, but they were more than 40 miles from ground zero. Ms. <PERSON> Yoerg </PERSON> said no radioactive material escaped from Tuesday's test The ground above the device subsided an hour after the blast, she said. That is considered a good sign by <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> officials because it indicates the radioactive materials have been permanently sealed underground.

<HEAD>More than 2,200 Cubans Released; Role of Riots Debated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 2,200 Cuban detainees have been released since last fall's riots at federal prisons in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and one advocate for the Cubans credits the uprisings for their freedom. A former federal official, however, denies that the riots speeded up the releases. `` It's unfortunate that it came to -LRB- a riot -RRB-. But 2,200 of the 3,800 -LRB- in custody before the riots last November -RRB- have been released because of the public attention the riot attracted,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Leshaw </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> attorney who advised the Cubans. `` The lesson is that the government should have instituted a legitimate review plan years before it did.'' But <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a former associate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general who helped set up the review process that decides the detainees' fates, said that a repatriation agreement reached last fall by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> would have had a similar effect without the riots. `` It would have been set up anyway, and I think the speed -LRB- of the releases -RRB- would have been maintained,'' he said. `` To say that the riot had no impact in bringing this to the public's attention would be wrong. But to say that the riot set the review process in place is not fair,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. Final appeals are scheduled to begin this week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the first of 73 Cuban detainees who were found to be deportable through the review process. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Mariel Cuban review program, said he expects some cases to be decided by late September. That could mean the deportation of some Cubans within six weeks. The detainees were among more than 125,000 Cubans who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1980 Mariel boatlift. They were jailed after their arrival because they committed crimes or were considered risks for other reasons. Although more than 2,200 Cuban detainees have been released since the riots, an additional 1,000 have been taken into federal custody, most of them after serving time in state prisons. More than 2,500 Cubans are in federal custody, and the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has decided that more than 1,500 of them are too dangerous to return to society. Even among those inmates, few are in imminent danger of being deported, however. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has agreed to take back only people named on a list which was compiled in 1984 and is considered outdated now. <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON> said only about 500 of 2,746 people on the list are still being held by federal authorities. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Cubans who are not on the list can be deported only after further negotiations with the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said the detainees being released are not being given an immigration status but are being `` re-paroled.'' `` As long as they do n't commit a crime, they could conceivably remain here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the rest of their days,'' he said.

 Lebanese villagers helped <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and local militia drive back a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla squad trying to infiltrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Tuesday, the army and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. Two guerrillas were captured and two escaped. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Palestinians began a two-day strike to protest deportations. Arab hospital officials said troops wounded 12 Palestinians in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> clashes, 10 of them in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The infiltration attempt was the 17th reported since Palestinians began rebelling against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule nearly nine months ago. The uprising has killed 255 Palestinians and four Israelis since Dec. 8. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio identified the guerrillas as members of a small pro-Syrian Palestinian faction, the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. A firefight broke out after Lebanese villagers from <LOCATION> Khalata </LOCATION>, 2 -LCB- miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border, spotted the squad walking out of a ravine and moving across a field, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and military sources said. Ten Lebanese men in the village armed themselves and villagers summoned Lebanese militiamen from the mostly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, who were backed by Israeli troops from border zone patrols, the reports said. The army said two guerrillas were captured and two escaped, one after being wounded. Two Lebanese militiamen were slightly wounded, the radio said. It was the first time <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has reported that Lebanese villagers helped thwart a border crossing. An army statement said an investigation showed `` the terrorists planned to take hostages in one of the settlements in the northern <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION>.'' The intruders carried barbed wire cutters, three Soviet-made rifles, a pistol with a silencer, four hand grenades, three rocket-propelled grenade lauchers and food and medical supplies. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ended a three-year occupation of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985 but maintains about 1,000 soldiers in its self-declared security zone to lend support to the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The army said youths stoned an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> car in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Anabta </LOCATION>, slightly wounding one passenger in the head. In <PERSON> Husan </PERSON>, near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, troops rounded up residents and searched homes after villagers stoned an Israeli bus, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army said it was checking the report. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> personally intervened to have a submachine gun returned to a Jewish settler in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Police confiscated the weapon last week after the man fired in the air to disperse Palestinians stoning his car near a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> `` believes that people who live in <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION> -LRB- biblical names for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> -RRB- should be allowed to carry weapons for self-defense,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio on Tuesday quoted <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> as saying that recently introduced plastic bullets would ease the frustration of soldiers trying to quell violent protests. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> addressed a closed-door session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Foreign Affairs Committee. A defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said live ammunition can be used only in self-defense, but officers may fire plastic bullets in `` hot pursuit'' of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demonstrators or to incapacitate ringleaders. Plastic bullets penetrate the body but generally cause less serious injuries. Tuesday's strike in the occupied territories and east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, seized by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, was the fifth such protest in 10 days. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> was the scene of the most violent protests after a five-day curfew was lifted at dawn. Troops trying to disperse stone-throwers shot and wounded 10 Palestinians, including two who were in serious condition, hospital officials said. The army said five Arabs were hurt. Two Palestinians were wounded in two other <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> clashes, hospital officials said. The strike was to protest deportations of 33 Palestinians since the uprising began, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> orders to expell 25 others. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, about 150 Israeli leftists demonstrated near the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to protest deportations. The army clamped curfews on three refugee camps and a village in the occupied lands, confining more than 100,000 Palestinians to their homes. The army said Tuesday that 5,116 Palestinians now are being held in Israeli jails, including 2,516 held for up to six months without trial.

<HEAD>Army Extends Comment Deadline On Biological Warfare Research</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, prompted by the governor of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, announced Tuesday it was extending into October the public comment deadline on a draft environmental impact study covering its biological warfare research program. Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> had requested a public hearing be held in his state `` and we saw no reason not to accomodate him.'' As a result, the deadline for public comment has been extended to Oct. 4 and a public hearing has been scheduled at the <ORGANIZATION> Tooele </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> on Sept. 19, <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Biological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> is of interest to citizens of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> because it is conducted in part at Dugway Proving Ground,'' the service added in a statement. The <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> hearing will be the second held by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> since it released its draft impact statement _ a massive study designed to support biological warfare research work at facilities around the country. The Army has portrayed the research work in that study as safe to the environment, essential to national security and a boon to science in general. `` In recognition of the potentially hazardous nature of -LRB- this -RRB- type of research ... the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as well as the scientific community has developed and implemented elaborate controls to assure adequate protection for the workforce and virtually total protection for the external environment,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> concluded in the draft assessment. The environmental study, released last May, was prompted by a lawsuit filed by the Foundation on Economic Trends in September 1986. The foundation is a Washington-based environmental activist group that has long focused its attention on the dangers of biological research and genetic engineering. After forcing the Army to conduct the study, the foundation attacked the draft work as `` shoddy and incomplete,'' vowing to launch a new legal assault if a more complete study was not performed. In releasing the draft study last May, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said it would accept written comments from the public only through Aug. 12. That deadline has been put aside and the new deadline of Oct. 4 established, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Within the biological field, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has committed itself by international treaty not to develop offensive biological weapons. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> _ through the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> _ maintains a large defensive program, aimed at developing vaccines and antidotes, detection systems and battlefield gear that could be used to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers if attacked with natural or man-made poisons. In order to develop such defenses, laboratories must work with a variety of deadly toxins. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, roughly $ 60 million is now being spent every year on the research, which is conducted at more than 100 military, university and private laboratories in 27 states and eight foreign countries.

<HEAD>Former SBC Head Says Abortion Protesters Should Use Lawful Means</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> said that while abortion is `` an abomination before God,'' he opposes tactics of the anti-abortion protesters that have led to hundreds of arrests this summer. The Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION>, issued the two-page treatise Sunday saying abortion should be protested only through lawful means. The leaflet, `` A Biblical Perspective on Civil Disobedience,'' said it represents the `` carefully studied view of the pastoral staff and deacons'' of the church, the state's largest Baptist congregation. In the leaflet, the ministers reaffirmed the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> stance against abortion, saying, `` We strongly oppose abortion as an abomination before God. We also advocate all lawful means of protesting abortion.'' More than 700 demonstrators have been arrested in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in protests organized by the New York-based Operation Rescue since the group arrived during the Democratic National Convention in July. The leaflet, which <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> read from the pulpit, cites biblical grounds for disobeying the law and concludes that Operation Rescue's tactics fail in three areas: _ Protesters have been charged with criminal trespassing, obstructing rights of way or other similar ordinances _ not for directly preventing abortions `` If certain anti-God protesters blocked the entrance to -LRB- the church -RRB- so we could not enter to worship, we would use the same ordinance to have them arrested!'' _ The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion `` neither requires abortions nor prohibits them, but makes them permissible with certain restrictions. _ Women are `` free moral agents responsible before Almighty God for their actions, including the exercise of the rights of their innocent, unborn child. Operation Rescue leader <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who has directed his demonstrations mostly with the help of clergy and supporters from outside <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, responded: `` We are glad Dr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> agrees that abortion is murder. We wish he could also see that Operation Rescue is not about protest or civil disobedience. It is about saving the lives of babies scheduled to be murdered.'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> had been silent on the issue of civil disobedience since watching a protest several weeks ago where his friend <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Moral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION> founder and an independent Baptist, appeared and offered his endorsement. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, who gave Operation Rescue $ 10,000, said he would return to be arrested and had predicted that <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> would join the protests.

</TEXT>
<HEAD>WYOMING:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Eight forest fires are burning in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> with four in the surrounding national forests in northwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. The Yellowstone Fires, some of which have spread out into the forests, had charred about 450,000 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park. The largest fire outside <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Mink </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire, covers 107,960 acres of the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Yellowstone officials said they have spent $ 54.4 million fighting fires and about 8,400 firefighters, including hundreds of Army soldiers, are working in the area. Unusually dry weather and a rash of lightning storms opened the fire season early this year, with the first Yellowstone fires reported in June.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MONTANA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Eight major fires had burned 177,000 acres of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> forests Tuesday, including two that erupted into serious threats overnight. They ranged in size up to 41,000 acres. Four, totaling 128,700 acres, were in designated wilderness areas, including one that had spread into Yellowstone National Park. Firefighters were gaining the upper hand on most, however, and no populated areas were threatened.

 More than 2,500 firefighters, backed up by dozens of National Guardsmen, were on the lines against the worst of 17 fires burning over 70,000 acres from the <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Caribou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> border. No structures were in imminent danger, but crews were protecting summer homes from the 16,000-acre Battle Axe wilderness fire northeast of <PERSON> Challis </PERSON>, a communications site from the 330-acre West <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Clearwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> east of <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION> and ranches from the 5,000-acre <LOCATION> Trail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire near the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> border in the Caribou. Some $ 3 million in commercial timber has been lost, mostly to the 7,400-acre Eagle Bar fire near <LOCATION> Hells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> border. The terrain is parched by a second straight year of drought, and Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> has put the entire state under an extreme fire emergency.

<HEAD>OREGON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Forces battling <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s biggest forest fire, the 31,000-acre lightning-sparked Tepee Butte blaze in the northeastern corner of the state, were doubled Tuesday to 545 people, said spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> DeHart </PERSON>. The Walker Mountain fire outside Grants Pass was contained Monday night at 2,150 acres. In the eastern high desert, a fire at a cement plant in <LOCATION> Durkee </LOCATION> quickly burned through 5,000 acres of rangeland, and a trash fire touched off 527 acres on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation.

<HEAD>CALIFORNIA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 9,500 lightning strikes Monday and early Tuesday ignited more than 100 brush and timber blazes in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a year after a similar storm spawned devastating firestorms, officials said. Although most of the fires were kept small, to the size of an acre or less, firefighters said they were by hot, windy weather in the drought-parched forests. The town of <LOCATION> Portola </LOCATION> in the northern <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, about 180 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, narrowly escaped flames Monday night when lightning-caused fires swept together.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> praised the <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> government Tuesday for its recent arrest and conviction of 48 persons on drug smuggling charges. While crediting <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> with `` strong action against drug traffickers,'' department spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said some Laotian authorities may be promoting narcotics trafficking with the support of the central government. She said that among those convicted was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who also served as a provincial governor. He was given a seven-year sentence. The department's position Tuesday differed from its conclusion in a report prepared last spring that <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> was the only nation `` for which the preponderance of information suggests that the government promotes drug trafficking as a matter of policy.'' The report, which covered several countries suspected of involvement in drug smuggling, was dated May 1. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> ordered it withheld from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> until last week because it contained sensitive information. The study was released to the media Tuesday. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said recent actions by Laotian authorities indicates their attitude on the drug issue may be changing. The May report said there was coordinated participation among Laotian government officials in drug smuggling and suggested this could not have taken place without the approval of authorities in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>. `` Specifically, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> finds that <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> officials have become involved directly in the processing of opium and marijuana, including three marijuana processing centers run by government organizations and at least four sanctioned heroin laboratories,'' the report said. The government also allows independent traffickers to operate on Laotian territory, said the study, which observed that large portions of the country are not under <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>'s effetive control. It said the Northern Lao Import @ <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is a government agency suspected of marketing narcotics abroad. The <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, described as a state enterprise controlled by the military, is alleged to be the chief agency involved in narcotics trafficking, the report said. Governments found to be engaged in drug smuggling are subject to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions prescribed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But no action was taken against <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> because President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decided that <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> cooperation in accounting for missing American servicemen might otherwise be impaired. In any case, sanctions imposed against <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> would be largely symbolic because <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> receives no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance. The administration has concluded that <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, has engaged in drug smuggling activities. But the report said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` is not a senior official'' of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> regards the ousted government of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the legitimate authority in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Therefore, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was considered beyond the scope of the report, which is aimed primarily at government officials who engage in drug trafficking.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flunked a key `` test of leadership'' in the Iran-Contra affair and questioned whether his Republican rival has the judgment needed to deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shot back that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> favors `` unilateral cuts'' in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defenses. The two contenders for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> swapped charges in their escalating war of campaign words as their top aides met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> without agreeing on a schedule for presidential debates this fall. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the Republicans would accept two presidential debates and one confrontation between vice presidential contenders, but nothing before Sept. 22. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said he favored a more extensive schedule. `` We want more debates, they want fewer,'' he said. `` We want to start them earlier, they want to start them later. We want to continue them up until the election takes place. They would like to end them much earlier,'' he added. The two sides will meet again on Thursday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> bargained through aides with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over debates as fresh reports surfaced of lingering tensions with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee's most persistent rival during the primary campaign. One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met with top <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides last week and was angered when he was handed a list of states to avoid during the fall campaign _ including several where he won primaries and caucuses earlier this year. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> called the report about the list `` absolutely false.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has sharpened his rhetoric in the face of widespread published reports that he has lost the campaign offensive, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a failure as a crime fighter and misguided on defense matters, and he resurrected the Iran-Contra affair as a campaign issue. `` Making tough decisions is a test of leadership. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed the decision to sell arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and in doing so he failed that test,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Referring to the Iran-Contra affair, dealings with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s indicted leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support during the early 1980s for ousted <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` And he's talking about judgment, about negotiations, about taking risks I would be very concerned about someone with that kind of judgment negotiating with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kept up his own steady drumbeat of criticism as he campaigned in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` We should not gamble <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future on another liberal governor coming out of nowhere,'' he said, likening <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wants `` to make unilateral cuts in our strategic systems, the MX, the Midgetman, no testing, get rid of two -LRB- aircraft -RRB- carrier groups, as well.'' The vice president also cautioned against complacency in dealing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I'm glad there is change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` But we'd better not let our guard down.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was encouraged by recent `` polling things'' indicating an unturn in his fortunes in recent weeks. `` That's turned around now after our upbeat Republican convention,'' he said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides scheduled a briefing with reporters for Wednesday. They are expected to emphasize that despite a recent Republican trend in the polls, their campaign is on track with television commercials set to begin running within the next two weeks, an organization in place in most of the 50 states and an estimated $ 25 million raised for the fall campaign. The money will be used in addition to the $ 46 million subsidy that both presidential tickets receive from the federal government. Despite plans for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to campaign jointly with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, there were indications that relations between the former rivals were strained. <PERSON> Top </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign aides met Thursday with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to discuss his role in the fall campaign, and a source said these aides arrived with a list of states where they asked <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> not to campaign. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the list included <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> carried all but <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> during the Democratic primary season, and finally, the two sides agreed he would campaign in all but <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> this fall. Also left undecided was whether any top <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign aides would move into a substantive role in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> national campaign organization. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> referred only briefly to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> during the day, saying, `` It's going to take a little longer to fully integrate the campaign, but I'm pleased.'' Instead, he focused his fire on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s record on crime was a `` blank. On the rare occasions when the vice president has been asked to do something on this subject, it's been a failure,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` wants them all'' when it comes to new weapons, and `` you ca n't have them all,'' particularly in view of the federal deficit. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also chose the day to resurrect the Iran-Contra affair as a campaign issue. He said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was head of an anti-terrorism task force that had issued a report denouncing any concessions to terrorist nations. `` The president and the vice president and a number of other people ... proceeded to do precisely what that commission said you should never do,'' he said. Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spoke to a meeting of fire fighters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and noted wryly that he'd gained a lot of experience in recent weeks in their line of work `` Where were you when I needed you,'' he said in a reference to the controversy that erupted over his service in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>.

 Many Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> prisoners of war fear persecution if they return home and some Iraqis may riot against repatriation, say <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigators who visited their camps. Prisoner camps in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are ruled internally by zealous Iraqi POWs who have switched their loyalty to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> experts said in a report scheduled for release Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> saw a copy of the report Tuesday. `` In each camp we visited -LRB- in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> -RRB-, there were fanatical, hysterical and sometimes violent demonstrations by the prisoners, who were assembled inside, along the barbed wire fences,'' the three <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> experts reported. Iraqi prisoners shouted slogans denouncing <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and the superpowers, and praised Islam and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the investigators said, and rallies were so fervid at the <LOCATION> Arak </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Davoudieh </PERSON> camps that they could not enter safely. About half the prisoners participated in each case and clearly were under the influence of 10-20 percent or the group, the report said. The team visited the camps in late July and early August. Camp committees provide religious and political instruction and persuasion under the name `` spiritual guidance,'' the experts said, and `` to us, it is indistinguishable from mental pressure.'' In the camps in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> holding Iraqi prisoners, the team concluded, `` There is a risk that riots may break out, for example in the moment when transfer is to take place with a view to registration and repatriation.'' In the camps in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the Iranian POWs were more orderly and Iraqi authorities maintained control, but many prisoners also appeared hesitant about going home after the 8-year-old war. `` The majority, however, seemed inclined to return to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, provided they were given effective gurantees that they would not be subject to persecution on their return,'' the report said. `` In the absence of such guarantees, however, their future looks gloomy.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> listed 46,098 POWs in its camps but many new prisoners had not been registered so the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team decided the number could be about 70,000. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> furnished a list of 18,139 POWs as of Aug. 1, but <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> authorities told the team many new prisoners had not been registered. The investigators decided the total could be about 35,000. Conditions in the camps of both sides `` are, on the whole, acceptable, although it might be desirable to have them further improved on some points,'' the report said. Pro-Khomeini Iraqis dominating <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s camps reject Western institutions, including the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, which registers prisoners of war and looks after their welfare, the investigators said. Because they view the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> as ineffective and dominated by the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, many have refused to register with it, complicating the repatriation process. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team also found, however, that some Iraqi POWs were never given a chance by Iranian authorities to register with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> or were dissuaded by the pro-Khomeini Iraqi prisoners. According to the report, Iranian authorities cooperated in verifying the whereabouts of `` nearly all'' 7,327 Iraqi POWs registered by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> before 1984 who were listed as missing, showing them to be safe and alive in or out of POW camps. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> authorities cooperated in tallying about 25,000 Iranian Kurds, 30,000 Iranian Arabs, and more than 300 other Iranians listed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as missing. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said they sought asylum and were in three refugee camps. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team found the facilities similar to POW camps, surrounded by barbed wire, but the residents had relative freedom of movement. More than 200 POWs held by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, the team said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has called them `` mercenaries'' but has promised to free them. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have accused each other of the torture and maltreatment of POWs. In <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team said, `` We never saw any direct evidence of atrocities, torture or beating; but from the conversations we had with some prisoners we can not dismiss allegations that such acts have occurred.'' In <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s Camp Number Nine in the <LOCATION> Ramadi </LOCATION> region, the team found abuse that `` did not seem typical of Iraqi camps at large.'' Members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team were Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bats </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Wolfram </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON>, an Austrian professor of international law, and <PERSON> Torkel </PERSON> <PERSON> Opsahl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, also a professor of international law. They visited <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s camps July 23-30 and the Iraqi camps July 31-Aug. 5

<HEAD>Agriculture Dept. Says Some Support Loans Won't Be Extended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it will not extend certain crop price support loans made to farmers, including some that begin to come due on Aug. 31. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON>, executive vice president of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the action is consistent with loan extension decisions that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced in January and March The proposal leading up to the decision has been criticized as heavy-handed by some farm groups, and is involved in a legal challenge by a group of farmers in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. In the past, the department has frequently allowed farmers to extend their regular nine-month price support loans for an additional year or longer as a way of keeping surplus grain off the market. When `` locked up'' in the loan program, or in the farmer-owned reserve or FOR, grain can not be sold on the market until the loan is settled. When the loans come due, farmers have the option paying the loans in full or forfeiting their crops to the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> said the following loans will not be extended: _ 1987 and subsequent crop price support regular loans for feed grains, rice, soybeans and _ 1985 and 1986 crop extended loans of wheat, barley, oats and soybeans _ 1983 and prior crop-year loans for commodities in the FOR _ Special producer loans <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> said the following loans can be extended at the producer's option for one year: _ 1985 and 1986 crop corn and sorghum extended loans which mature on March 31 through Dec. 31 this _ 1984 crop FOR loans which mature on March 31 through Dec. 31 this year In addition, he said, 1987 crops of wheat and feed grains will not be permitted to enter the FOR.

<HEAD>Stress May Be Factor In Bizarre String Of Scientists' Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stress can not be ruled out as the cause of some of the mysterious deaths and disappearances in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s defense and electronics industry, a union said Tuesday. The Manufacturing, <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said it recently surveyed technical, managerial and professional staff in six companies and found many experience high stress levels and fewer than 4 percent are happy in their jobs. Sixteen men employed in defense or security work _ including seven who worked for <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> or its related companies _ have died in unusual circumstances since 1982 Many of the men died in unexplained, even bizarre circumstances. Most deaths resembled suicides, although only two have been so ruled. `` Stress can not be ruled out as a contributing factor in the spate of Marconi deaths,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON>, the union's national officer. `` The people who have died were overwhelmingly in responsible positions. The electronics industry is highly competitive and the defense side has undergone an immense change over the last five years. The screw has been tightened and more and more pressure has been piled on,'' he said. <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> called for employers in the industry to `` treat people at work like people and not numbers'' in an attempt to ease the pressure. The union surveyed employees at <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Racal </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, <PERSON> Ferranti </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> and Thorn <ORGANIZATION> EMI </ORGANIZATION>, all major electronics companies with a sizeable involvement in government defense work It found only 3.5 percent said they were happy and fulfilled in their work, and 41 percent said they were dissatisfied with their work environment to the point where they said it affected their home life and health. Nearly one-quarter said they often found it difficult to relax and the same proportion complained of bringing their problems home and of feeling constantly drained and lethargic. The survey results are based on 500 replies to 2,000 questionnaires distributed to union members and non-members in the industry. The British government has said the spate of deaths and disappearances is odd but has insisted the frequency of deaths is a coincidence and has rejected calls for an inquiry. The string of deaths dates from March 1982 when <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON>, a 45-year-old expert on supercomputers and computer-controlled aircraft, drove his car off a highway and down a railway embankment. Police said he had been drinking, but friends denied it. Among the succeeding deaths was a computer systems analyst for a <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION> unit who killed himself by tying a rope to a tree, looping the other end around his neck and then driving off in his car at high speed. A computer expert for Easams, a Marconi sister company, drove his car, its trunk loaded with tanks of gasoline, into a vacant restaurant and burned to death. Three of the men died in or under their cars in fume-filled garages, and a digital communications expert fell from a hotel room in the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> after expressing fear for his life. Most recently, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferry </PERSON> was found electrocuted Aug. 24 in his apartment at the headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Frimley </LOCATION>, 35 miles southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The former army brigadier, 60, was an assistant marketing director with special responsibility for liaison with the armed forces. His widow said the pressure of his secret work may have contributed to his death.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign said Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee was willing to meet <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in two debates and hold a third between their running mates. But the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign held out for at least one more debate. A meeting between the top officials of both campaigns ended with disagreement over both the number and timing of debates between the presidential nominees. There was no decision on who would sponsor the debates or on what the format would be _ but both sides agreed to meet again Thursday for more negotiations. `` We want more debates; they want fewer,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, campaign chairman for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee. `` ` We want to start them earlier; they want to start them later,'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said. `` We want to continue them up until the election takes place; they would like to end them much earlier.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee's campaign, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has offered to hold two presidential debates and a third between the vice presidential nominees, with the first coming as early as Sept. 22 That date would rule out, however, rival proposals for debates on Sept. 8, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION>, and on Sept. 14, sponsored by a bipartisan commission set up by both parties to hold the debates. `` Provided that the issues of format and staging and so forth are resolved, the vice president has agreed to debate twice, and we have agreed that there could be a vice presidential debate,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the commission's proposed second debate on Sept. 25 `` would be agreeable with us.'' Both officials spoke after a two-hour private meeting in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> offices of <LOCATION> Brountas </LOCATION>' law firm. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> and campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> represented <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was represented by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>; media adviser <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>; and campaign aide <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>. They met as the public debate over debates continued from both sides of the presidential campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, pressed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> anew to meet him in debate and charged the Republicans `` do n't want to debate'' the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's record. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, declared `` there will be debates'' but said too many would be `` boring.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, explaining the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's opposition to a third presidential debate, said that `` the campaign is a continuing debate'' and that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offer was for as many debates as were held in the 1984 campaign. `` We're not afraid of three -LRB- presidential debates -RRB- at all,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` ... But there are other ways to campaign. Debates have a way of freezing the campaign, during their pendency, and we're quite anxious that we continue to campaign the way in which we've been campaigning over the course of the past couple weeks.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> told reporters traveling with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the proposal for two presidential and one vice presidential debates was `` a firm position'' and `` our only offer.'' He pointed to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s experience as a debater and said, `` We're cognizant of the fact that it's one of his areas of expertise.'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s negotiators had ruled out devoting the first debate to foreign policy and national security issues _ the subjects <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wants to debate first. `` One of the reasons is that would create very high expectations in light of the vice president's experience over the past seven and a half years, and they do n't want to be confronted with those high expectations,'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> negotiators objected to holding a debate within two weeks of Election Day because `` they would n't have time to recover from a potential disastrous mistake at that debate.'' Complicating the argument over when to hold the debates are major sporting events which will occupy much of evening television network time during the fall. The professional football season begins Sunday and the Olympics get under way Sept. 17 and run for two weeks. Both events are followed by baseball's World Series. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wants to begin the debates with the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Presidential Debates' proposal for a Sept. 14 debate in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, because it is virtually the last date possible before the Olympics. Because the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign refused to meet on that date, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign asked for a substitute date for that debate. Similarly, <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wants a final debate on Oct. 25, 26 or 27, in hopes the World Series would no longer provide a distraction to viewers. The talks did not resolve the dispute over sponsorship of thedebates. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has accepted the proposal of the commission, which was established with the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic party chairmen. The League of Women Voters, sponsor of fall debates in the last three presidential elections, has proposed a debate Sept. 8 in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, followed by debates Oct. 6 in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; Oct. 23 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; and Nov. 1 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. League president <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> offered to help mediate, and said the lingering dispute is evidence of the political parties' `` inexperience in debates sponsorship. After <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION> on Sept. 14, the commission wants other debates on Sept. 25 in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; Oct. 11 in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>.; and Oct. 27 in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> debate could be for the vice presidential candidates. In 1984, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met Democrat <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in two debates, on Oct. 7 and Oct. 21, and a third debate was held Oct. 11 between their running mates. In 1980, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> met in one debate, on Oct. 28. In 1976, President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> met <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in three debates, and their running mates also held a debate.

<HEAD>Number of Americans Behind on Payments Up in Spring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of Americans behind on their mortgage payments rose in the April-June quarter for the second time in 2 -LCB- years, an organization of lenders said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said the number of homeowners who were at least 30 days late in making a mortgage payment edged up to 4.90 percent of the 9.8 million mortgages surveyed in the second quarter. The increase in late mortgage payments was the second rise since the fourth quarter of 1985. The delinquency rate had fallen in the first quarter to 4.78 percent after rising in the last three months of 1987 to 4.95 percent. The third quarter 1987 level _ 4.71 percent _ was the lowest in eight years. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON>, executive vice president of the association, called the latest increase `` disturbing.'' `` However,'' he said in a statement, `` one quarter does not make a trend, and this uptick should be kept in perspective.'' The Mortgage Bankers' report said employment growth and rising wages should continue to shrink the delinquency rate in future quarters. Despite the slightly higher delinquency rate in the second quarter, foreclosures held steady at 0.27 percent, the same as in the January-March period and the last three months of 1987. Even with the latest rise in the delinquency rate from the previous quarter, all regions of the country had a lower delinquency rate when compared with a year earlier. The Northeast had the lowest delinquency rate, 3.78 in the second quarter, down from 4.13 percent a year earlier. It was followed by the West, where the delinquency rate dropped from 4.14 percent to 4.05 percent over a year. The South, where some states have been hard hit by the depression in the oil industry, had the highest delinquency rate, 5.19 percent, a scant improvement from 5.21 percent a year earlier. The second quarter rate in North Central states was 4.89 percent, down from 4.96 percent.

<HEAD>Power Surge At Savannah River Reactor Remains Unexplained, Panel
Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unreviewed calculation flawed four different ways led to the failed restart of a nuclear weapons production reactor, an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> advisory panel was told Thursday. But no one knows why the same reactor at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, underwent a power surge a few days later, after a successful restart, the panel was told. It was discovery of a flawed calculation decades ago that led the department earlier this year to order its remaining weapons reactors limited to half power. A runaway power surge with safety systems disconnected caused the 1986 Chernobyl reactor explosion in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Department officials have said their concern was not so much the two abnormal restart events in themselves, but delays in being told about them by the operating contractor, the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> reported the Aug. 10 power surge only in the next day's routine operations report despite assuring the department on Aug. 9 it would be quicker to report unusual The series of events at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>'s P-Reactor was described in a report to the department's new Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety by a subcommittee headed by <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, associate dean of engineering at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for environment, safety and health, told reporters that new communications agreements had been reached between <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and the department, but the reactor in question was shut down Aug. 17 and would remain closed until investigators discover why power surged by 2 percent without explanation. When the power surge occured, the reactor was 90 percent of the way to its planned half-power operating level. `` You are n't supposed to have any power surges,'' <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> said. The committee also was given an analysis of the events of Aug. 8-Aug. 17 done for <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> by <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> A Powers of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Powers' report said the surge was `` miniscule'' and though rare had happened before. It was quickly corrected by the operators. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said it was well within the trigger point that would have led to an automatic shutdown. The three reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> produce no electricity. Neutrons produced in the nuclear reactions of uranium make either plutonium or tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, for nuclear weapons. All three reactors were shut for various reasons when the department decided to finish a tritium production run in the P-Reactor after a 119-day shutdown. This was the longest idle period the reactor had ever undergone with a fuel core in place. The flawed calculation of the expected strength of the nuclear reactions on startup was used to position the neutron-absorbing control rods, according to Powers' report. The reactor becamed self-sustaining only when the rods where withdrawn far more than the calculation said they should have been, and self-sustaining operation could not be maintained. The department admitted earlier that the calculation had ignored the buildup of helium in the reactor from decay of tritium during the long shutdown. Helium tends to `` poison'' or suppress the nuclear reaction. Powers pinpointed three other flaws in the calculation he said no one reviewed. _ The actual history of the fuel was not used in the calculation The analyst in question used the out-of-date planned use of the fuel. `` Oversight or not, this is a less readily excused error'' than neglecting helium. _ The presence in the fuel of samarium, a metallic element in the rare-earths group, was not sufficiently accounted for _ Three control rods that could n't be raised were left out of the calculation `` There appears to be no Department of energy standards on the nature of operational readiness reviews,'' <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said. Since the shutdown had been the longest ever, `` It is surprising then that no <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> personnel were present for this restart. What kind of oversight is it that does not follow unusual events during this period of enhanced scrutiny of the production reactors?'' he said. Powers said he found no evidence that `` desire for production at the expense of safety'' prompted the restart and in fact a fresh fuel charge would have optimized production after the long shutdown.

 A car bomb exploded Tuesday in <LOCATION> Chtoura </LOCATION>, a Syrian-controlled market town in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, killing a 7-year-old boy and wounding seven other children aged 3 to 8, police said reported. The white <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> exploded at 1 p.m. near a bank office on the Beirut-Damascus road, the main route used by the Syrian army to supply its forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. No one claimed responsibility for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s the 12th car bomb of the year. By police count, the earlier bombings killed 103 people and wounded 371. Police said the children were playing behind a tree when 44 pounds of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> inside the car detonated. The explosion broke windows in shops and apartment buildings and five other parked cars ablaze. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and keeps 40,000 soldiers in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Tuesday's explosion appeared to be one of several in the past two weeks aimed at discrediting <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s peacekeeping role while <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> chooses a new president. At least nine explosive charges have gone off near <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> army checkpoints in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, causing damage but no casualties. President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term expires Sept. 23 and he can not seek a new term. Parliament was to elect a new president Aug. 18, but the election was postponed for lack of a quorum and no new date was set. The deadlock caused political turmoil and threatened to rekindle a 13-year-old sectarian civil war that has been largely dormant for the past 18 months.

They were the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> victims of Sunday's tragedy evacuated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said three were soldiers and the fourth was a woman `` dependent of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> serviceman.'' It identified the soldiers as Air Force Master Sgt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, 32; <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> 1st Lt. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Strader </PERSON>, 30; and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pfc </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>, 24, and the woman only as <PERSON> Anderea </PERSON> <PERSON> Delarosa </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Soldiers fatally shot three armed men in a car Tuesday, a few miles from the spot where an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bomb killed eight soldiers on a bus and injured 27 others. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying the dead were <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> and brothers <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> was a brother of one of eight men held for questioning following the Aug. 20 bus bombing. All those questioned were released without charge on Monday. The shooting in <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION>, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, was seen as part of a stepped-up British response to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s summer campaign against the army and police, which has killed 27 members of the security forces and triggered a wave of outrage in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and in the province. Also Tuesday, two buses and a van were hijacked and set afire in Roman Catholic west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, but no casualties were reported. Four mortar bombs and 25 pounds of explosives were found aboard a bus crossing the border from the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, said police in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>. A police spokesman said two rifles were recovered at the scene of the shooting that took place at about 4 p.m. -LRB- 11 a.m. EDT -RRB-. `` The incident occurred when soldiers encountered armed men in a vehicle and opened fire,'' he said. He said officials had not yet identified the three bodies. He released no further details. A British army spokesman, unidentified in keeping with British practice, said security forces sealed off roads leading into the surrounding area where the three men were slain as police gathered forensic evidence. Press Association, the British domestic news agency, quoting unidentified military sources, said the <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION>, the elite <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> regiment, was involved in the shooting. The army said its policy prohibits confirming whether soldiers of the <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> took part. Local residents reported seeing a military helicopter pick up four men in civilian clothes and whisk them away minutes after the shooting. A man and a woman claiming to be a brother and sister of two of the dead men, drove up to the police cordon and the man shouted at the officers: `` They were gunned down by dogs _ they were set up by the SAS!'' The women added: `` They may have gunned down three, but a lot more will go for them!'' The police spokesman said Tuesday's shootings occurred on the main road from <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Carrickmore </LOCATION>, a few miles away from the site of the Aug. 20 bombing which exploded near the British army bus. The bus bomb dealt the army in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> its worst blow since 1982, and brought to 26 the military death toll in a summer of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks in Ulster, mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the province with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which is predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. The bombs and Czechoslovakian-made Semtex explosives discovered earlier Tuesday were on a bus owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Lough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a private bus service, when it was stopped and searched at a border checkpoint, a police spokesman said. They were found in luggage in the passenger compartment, said the spokesman, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the bus driver and passengers were being questioned but no arrests were made. The discovery followed a weekend of bombings, shootings, riots and other violence in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newry </LOCATION> that was sparked by the extradition from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> of a convicted guerrilla and jail escapee. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> led the violent protests over <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s extradition, police said Security forces in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> have said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> received Semtex, a lightweight and difficult to detect explosive, in arms shipments from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has held discussions with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> about making it more difficult for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> to obtain Semtex.

 American businessman <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and two Ghanaians have pleaded innocent to charges of trying to export 2,000 African gray parrots to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, identified as managing director of Exotic Fauna International, and Ghanaian wildlife exporters <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bello </PERSON> were held over for court appearances Wednesday. They entered pleas Monday before a national public tribunal where each faced a 25-count charge, including `` acts detrimental to the welfare of the sovereign people of <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>.'' A month ago, the Record newspaper of <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, quoted relatives as saying <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, 46, of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crescenta </LOCATION>, went to <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> in November and got all the necessary permits for exporting the gray parrots. They said <ORGANIZATION> Exotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fauna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> is a bird import company based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and sanctioned by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, the paper reported. `` We consider him a hostage, not a criminal,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s nephew <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, was quoted as saying At the Democratic National Convention July 19 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, about a dozen onlookers and reporters watched when <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s family took the podium to urge that he be released from jail in <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> Ghanaian authorities said June 13 that <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> were arrested after Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Assassie-Gyimah </PERSON>, a senior government official, discovered the birds squawking in an airplane hold. The other American was not identified and was neither mentioned nor present at the court proceeding Monday. Exporting African gray parrots from <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> is illegal. The gpverment accuses <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> of paying more than 6 million cedis -LRB- $ 200,000 -RRB- to the Ghanaians, who are accused of bribing officials for phony export permits. The African gray parrot, once common in West African forests, is noted for its ability to learn to talk quickly. Excessive trapping of the birds and destruction of their habitat have made them scarce. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, was quoted by the <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION> paper as saying he visited the military compound in <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> where his brother was held and found prisoners `` chained together and beaten with hoses, and they sleep in cells with dirt floors.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said that consular officials visited <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> many times and found him to be all right.

 Florala Mayor H.T. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, accused of embarrassing his town with `` voodoo'' antics, testified Tuesday that he granted pardons to convicted offenders because he has a soft heart. `` My mission on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is to help people,'' the 85-year-old former tire store owner testified as the defense began presenting its case at his impeachment trial for alleged incompetence and misuse of office. Before taking the stand, he told reporters: `` Satan is trying to destroy <PERSON> Florala </PERSON>'s government. I love Florala.'' Prosecution witnesses depicted <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> as a man who undermined the law by abusing his pardon power. He is accused of pardoning more than 100 traffic offenders, including 27 drunken drivers. `` I have more power than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> was quoted as saying by City Clerk <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooten </PERSON>, the final prosecution witness. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, removal from office is decided by a civil proceeding conducted much like a criminal trial. <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> will send the case to the jury Wednesday morning. In closing arguments, <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestwood </PERSON>, said it would be cruel to impeach <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>. `` Why go to all this expense?'' <PERSON> Prestwood </PERSON> said. `` They've done everything in the book to make H.T. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> look bad.'' But Attorney General <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegelman </PERSON> described the situation in <LOCATION> Florala </LOCATION> as `` the most abusive case I've ever heard of in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He said the impeachment complaint was brought `` to prevent a tragedy'' such as a highway death caused by a drunken driver who had been pardoned `` at the whim of a mayor.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hooten </PERSON> said she told the mayor some of the offenders getting pardoned had been highly intoxicated. Asked his reaction, she said, `` It did n't seem like it mattered to him.'' Questioned by prosecutors about the pardons, <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> said people came to him with sad stories and he was just trying to help them. `` I'm just a little soft-hearted,'' he said. In earlier testimony Tuesday, witnesses told the jury that <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> once threatened a councilman with a knife and asked the police chief to give him confiscated wine. The mayor of <LOCATION> Florala </LOCATION>, a town of about 5,000 on the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> line 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Andalusia </LOCATION>, was charged with corruption, incompetence and willful neglect of duty by the grand jury that called for his ouster. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>' critics also deplored his July proclamation of `` National Voodoo Week'' and his earlier purported attempt to scare the police chief by sprinkling so-called `` voodoo powder'' around City Hall, council chambers and down corridors to the jail. In his testimony, the mayor elaborated on the caper. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> said he did not believe in voodoo and the yellow powder he spread at City Hall was sulfur powder not meant to harm anyone. After the incident was reported by the media, the mayor said he decided to capitalize on publicity. `` I do n't even know what voodoo means. ... I made a mistake in the way I did it,'' he testified. Police Chief A.V. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> testified Tuesday that he was not influenced by the mayor's voodoo joke. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, however, said the mayor's abuse of pardoning power turned <LOCATION> Florala </LOCATION> law enforcement into a joke. He said arrested motorists would laugh at officers and one told him: `` I do n't mind you arresting me. I'm going to get a pardon.'' The mayor's attorney tried to show Tuesday that the pardons granted by <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> demonstrated his concern about the cost of housing people in the city jail and his belief that it was better for them to be working, earning an income. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> defended his performance in office over the last four years, citing annual increases in the city's sales tax collection from $ 850,152 in 1984 to last year's $ 930,365. In her testimony, Mrs. <PERSON> Hooten </PERSON> said the pardons granted by <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, who was elected in 1984, cost the city $ 27,767 in canceled or refunded fines. She said the mayor told her he did n't think some of the arrested offenders were guilty. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>' term expires Oct. 3. But <PERSON> Florala </PERSON>'s city election has been postponed by a federal court, and the mayor, barring removal through impeachment, could hold the office for an indefinite period as a result.

 Fairly moderate earthquake ground motion could damage a major protective system of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s P-Reactor at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, a department official said Tuesday But major reactor components could withstand larger quakes, according to a report by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for environment, safety and health to the department's new <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Nuclear Facility Safety The department plans to operate the P-Reactor for another year before beginning a major upgrade of its protection against earthquakes <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> presented <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>'s first numerical estimates of the ability of major systems of the reactor to come through earthquakes and still function. Studies aimed at similar estimates are under way for the two other nuclear weapons material production reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>. Ground acceleration of about 1 foot per second per second would be enough to harm the filtration system designed to remove radioactive particles from air escaping from the reactor building in a major accident, <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> said. In this `` confinement'' system, `` the limiting areas ... are primarily the filters'' _ and at that acceleration, there is doubt `` that you can keep them up against the ductwork.'' Beyond about 3.2 feet per second per second, `` you probably do n't have confinement capability,'' <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> said. One foot per second per second is about 3 percent of the acceleration that gravity imparts to a freely falling object, about 32 feet per second per second. The acceleration due to gravity is called `` g,'' and engineers frequently express other accelerations as a fraction of `` g'' _ 16 feet per second per second is 0.5 g, 1 foot per second per second is 0.03 g, and so People in a car accelerating steadily to 60 miles per hour in 15 second undergo an acceleration of a little less than 6 feet per second per second or 0.18 g There is no necessary connection between ground acceleration and earthquake severity, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a civil engineer in the <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, office of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey. Destructiveness `` is a function of duration of the shaking and its frequency content,'' as well as local geology, he said. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> estimated that the 1886 earthquake centered 19 miles west of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, caused ground accelerations of about 0.5 g over the center of the earthquake, which has been estimated at 6.8 to 7.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale Acceleration in the 1886 earthquake probably would have been less than 0.1 g about 200 miles away, he said <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is about 115 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>'s report, ground accelerations of 0.1 g could disable the emergency cooling system At 0.2 g ability to shut down the reactor and remove its decay heat could be jeopardized Each year, there is a 1 per cent to 2 percent chance of an earthquake large enough to produce ground accelerations of 0.05 g to 0.1 g at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> of <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>'s The chance of accelerations of 0.2 g is about one in a thousand `` As I see it, there is a crying need to sit back and say what are the seismic criteria for the site _ no pun intended _ from the ground up,'' <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said. `` Keep in mind these systems were never subjected to a seismic analysis.'' Civilian reactors must be able to shut down in earthquakes of varying severity, with standards tailored to individual sites. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingraham </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the most lenient is the site for the <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rowe </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, where shutdown must be possible in ground motions of 0.05 g The strictest is the Diablo Canyon site in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, close to a major fault, where shutdown must be possible in motions of 0.75 g

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' labor leaders embraced a federal judge's ruling Tuesday that blocked layoffs of 4,000 employees, although it allows the company to go ahead with service cutbacks. `` We're please at this ruling. It will save 4,000 jobs -LRB- and it rules that -RRB- the proposed furloughing is illegal,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of District 100 of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s largest with 12,000 workers <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, flight attendants' leader <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and pilots local vice chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vician </PERSON> talked to reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> hall just off the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> as their attorneys studied the 50-page opinion by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Eastern, while satisfied that <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> will allow the closing of its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hub and the elimination of 140 flights, said it will appeal his decision that the company can not make mass layoffs without bargaining with its unions. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> called the decision `` an opportunity'' for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to show he is more than `` the No 1 union-buster.'' `` Here now is a chance for him to change his style. The ball is in <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s court,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. He and the other union leaders expressed willingness to meet with management to discuss cost-cutting measures that preserve jobs. `` We're not here as laborers trying to direct the business of the airline. We're trying to protect jobs,'' <PERSON> Vician </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said the flight attendants were still willing to offer a job-sharing and leave plan, rejected earlier by management, to save jobs and money. Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said she could n't comment on the unions' interpretation of the opinion. The union leaders stressed <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s findings of fact that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which took over Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> two years ago, has been antagonistic toward unions, tried to spin off assets such as the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> shuttle service and has worsened <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s financial problems by using <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> resources to pay for its own sale, taking a non-interest $ 16 million note from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and taking a $ 6 million annual management fee from Eastern. `` In short, the record shows that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has served as a lending institution to meet the needs of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the non-union carrier also owned by Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' the opinion said. `` It confirmed what we've been saying,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. `` This is a federal judge. It's not the unions anymore or our consultants talking.'' Eastern is cutting 140 flights and service from 14 cities, while reducing its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hub from 53 to six flights and non-hub status. Ms. <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said the company has n't determined what it will do with the protected employees.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was among the 30 nations that participated in a U.S.-backed drug crackdown, even though the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> brought economic sanctions against the country because of drug charges against its military leader. Colombian narcotics officials, meanwhile, were skeptical about the success of the joint drug crackdown. They said no major traffickers were arrested in the operations from Aug. 1-28 and the amounts of drugs seized were not impressive. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had encouraged the 30 countries to step up enforcement and specifically to cooperate in cross-border raids, mostly in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, during August. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> praised the anti-drug campaign and said it showed that international cooperation could eliminate sanctuaries for drug traffickers who tried to evade capture by going to other countries. Lawn and other representatives made brief statements during a meeting with reporters, but journalists were not allowed to ask questions. The <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> meeting coincided with a report in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on the results of the operations by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the raids led to more than 1,200 arrests, the seizure of 11 tons of cocaine and the destruction of 244 tons of marijuana, 118,000 coca plants and 13 cocaine laboratories. The Panamanian delegate to the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> meeting, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Nivaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrinan </PERSON>, said in his statement that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> participated in the program even though it is `` suffering the greatest aggression in its history.'' He did not specifically mention the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, was indicted in February by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that accused him of drug trafficking. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> refused to resign and leave the country. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, controls the civilian government. <PERSON> Madrinan </PERSON> said the month-long drug crackdown in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> produced 96 arrests and the seizure of 4.8 pounds of cocaine, $ 2,084, eight vehicles and eight weapons. Reporters were now allowed to ask who had been arrested. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> sent delegates to the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> meeting. Colombian officials, speaking with the condition they not be identified, noted the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> reported the raids turned up 13 cocaine laboratories and they said more than 13 labs are frequently found in a single week in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> report said that of the 11 tons of cocaine and cocaine base seized, 6.2 tons were found in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries. The Colombian officials said that in one raid in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> five years ago more than 10 tons of cocaine and cocaine base were seized. The Colombians also questioned a section of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> statement that said the raids were the result of cooperation among the participating countries. They said cross-border operations between <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> were a week late because of border disputes and claimed <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> did virtually nothing during the campaign.

<TEXT>
 Supreme Court Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> on Tuesday allowed the government to begin enforcing a new law banning sexually obscene dial-a-porn message services, pending the full court's review of the statute. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> denied a request by <ORGANIZATION> Sable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for a stay of a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> federal court ruling that upheld that portion of the law banning telephone services whose messages fall under the legal definition of `` obscene.'' The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> court, however, also ruled that federal regulators may not ban `` indecent'' messages from phone lines. The government has appealed that decision and both portions of the law are now before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The justice's denial of a stay means the government ban on obscene telephone messages is in effect and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will begin enforcing it, said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Killory </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> general counsel. `` I do n't see any basis for us to hold up enforcement,'' she said. Sable attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he was not surprised by <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s action, but said, `` I think we can make a very convincing case that the statute as written is unconstitiuional and we expect to do that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> considers material `` indecent'' if it depicts or describes sexual or excretory organs or activities in a patently offensive way. The commission deems material `` obscene'' if it depicts sexual acts in a patently offensive way, appeals to the prurient interest of an average person and lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. The law applies only to interstate dial-a-porn calls and those in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. It provides for both criminal and civil prosecution and carries penalties of up to $ 50,000 for each day of violation and imprisonment of up to six months. The law had been scheduled to take effect July 1, but <PERSON> Sable </PERSON>'s lawsuit challenge and another separate lawsuit filed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> delayed enforcement

 A large inner-city hospital and a tiny rural one Tuesday joined the growing number of community hospitals across the nation forced to close their doors because they ca n't make ends meet. <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, which has 437 beds, is the 10th community hospital in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to shut down since 1986, officials said. It will close its doors within a few weeks after 85 years of service to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Candace </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulsebus-Fong </PERSON>. White Hall Hospital, an acute-care facility with 30 beds in southwestern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, is the sixth small rural hospital to shut down in the state since 1986, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fact that both of them were forced to close was no coincidence at all, but the result of conscious decisions of federal and state governments to underfund the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid programs that pay for health care for the elderly and the poor,'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said. In 1987, a record 79 community hospitals shut down across the nation, five of them in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asssociation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s officials said the hospital has suffered from late and inadequate federal reimbursement for its service to poor patients. Illinois' Medicaid program, strapped for funds itself, owes the hospital $ 1.7 million, they said. In April, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s laid off 60 percent of its staff to meet expenses. Since then, it has used only 115 of its beds. About 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION>'s patients rely on Medicaid or Medicare to pay their bills, Ms. <PERSON> Hulsebus-Fong </PERSON> said. `` Another 10 percent of those are indigent, so less than 10 percent have any kind of commercial insurance,'' she said. All but about 15 percent of White Hall's patients relied on Medicaid or Medicare, said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, the hospital's administrator `` Our board just could not justify maintaining an operation that lost money every single day of the week,'' he said.

 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> brush fire destroyed at least five homes while crews fighting forest fires gained ground Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> went to employment offices in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in search of more firefighters. National Guardsmen in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> were sent to the firelines, and <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> volunteers were sent for fire training. Firefighters were at work against fires charring woodland in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. And dozens of fires have been allowed to smolder for months in the vast interior of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Across the Bay from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in the grass - and brush-covered <LOCATION> Orinda </LOCATION> hills, a fire burned out of control for two hours Tuesday afternoon in an exclusive section of <LOCATION> Orinda </LOCATION> Five houses were `` totaled'' and two others had an undetermined amount of damage from flames still burning late Tuesday after the blaze was largely contained, Fire Chief <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said. `` The hills are steep, and when the wind comes up, it makes those hills like chimneys with flames just coming right up them,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Artist </PERSON>. She said the fire came within yards of her home. Another remote <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> town mopped up after lightning-sparked blazes swept within feet of the community and forced evacuation of the town hospital for several hours. Nationally, 18,000 firefighters were on the job in one of the nation's worst fire years, reported the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a central office in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> that coordinates the fighting of forest fires in the West. To date, 3.4 million acres of forest has burned, slightly ahead of last year's pace, but 2.1 million of that total is in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where 30 fires smoldered Tuesday, the center reported. The fire center told <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regions affected by the fires that temporary firefighters may be hired on a contingency basis for about $ 7 an hour, said information officer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> said each national forest must determine its requirements. `` We're not saying we're going to hire 4,000 or 8,000,'' he said. Applicants lined up at state employment offices in the affected areas. `` We've got them hanging out our ears,'' said applicant interviewer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rummel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> placed his entire state under an extreme fire emergency Monday, releasing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> to reinforce firefighters. Wyoming Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> authorized committing 120 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> volunteers to the effort, after they were given 32 hours of training. Firefighters in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> regained ground they lost last week against one of the tougher fires blazing in the park, sealing off the popular Old Faithful geyser from flames 5 miles away. Continued low wind in the country's oldest national park on Monday allowed firefighters there to make further inroads against the fires, which have charred some 450,000 acres of the 2.2-million-acre park. That calm weather had prompted a decision to reopen <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s south entrance for the frst time in 10 days, but spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON> said fire activity put the area back in danger. The road had been closed for 10 days. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, firefighters late Monday kept fast-moving lightning fires from reaching a hospital, school and other buildings in remote <LOCATION> Portola </LOCATION>. There were no injuries in the town of 1,600 residents, and the only building lost was a barn. `` It burned trees right up to the high school lawn,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officer <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurley </PERSON>. About 30 patients and staff were evacuated from the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plumas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for 5 -LCB- hours, while deputies, the local search and rescue team and volunteers helped state firefighters halt the blaze. `` It was amazing. People came from all over to help save our homes _ people I never saw before,'' said <PERSON> Joann </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavarg </PERSON>, 41. `` I was raised in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. I never knew what it was like before to live in a small town were everybody cared about everybody else.'' The Combination fire in southwestern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> made no gains overnight beyond the 11,200 acres it has burned between <LOCATION> Philipsburg </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON>, said fire information officer <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>. It has burned a mining camp and threatened the small community of <LOCATION> Maxville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said it was 85 percent contained Tuesday. In the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness north of Yellowstone National Park, fire officials predicted the 40,300-acre Storm Creek fire and the 34,200-acre <LOCATION> Hellroaring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire would eventually meet, said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Tafoya </PERSON>, information officer. A fire crew bus careened off an embankment in northeastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> late Monday while returning 16 firefighters to the <ORGANIZATION> Colville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservation </ORGANIZATION>, and five were injured, authorities said. Fires on the reservation and the neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Colville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> have burned more than 22,500 acres. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where some fires have been burning since April, the biggest blaze had covered more than 541,000 acres 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION>. But the fires do not threaten any developed property or valuable timber, and a special interagency office handling fire information for the state has been disbanded for the season.

 An 8-foot alligator is a full day's work, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> reckons. First he plunges his hunting knife through the gator's thick hide at the tip of its tail. Then it's a slow and difficult cut to the snout. `` You got to look at it as an hour a foot to properly skin and gut a gator,'' <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>, who operates one of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s few alligator processing facilities, said Tuesday. `` There's no way around it. It's hard work, you bet.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Gator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the remote southwest <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grasslands, <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> and his relatives have sharpened their knives and readied the pots in anticipation of the first statewide gator hunt since the 37-year-old <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> was a boy spearing alligators at nearby <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trafford </LOCATION>. For 30 days beginning at sunset Thursday, 238 license holders will be stalking areas of the state where the gator population is extraordinarly high. The hunt, the first since 1962, is needed to trim the numbers of the once-threatened alligator, which has rebounded strongly since strict anti-poaching measures were instituted in the early 1970s. The estimated 1 million alligators in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is nearly double the 1975 population, said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, head of the alligator research unit for the state Game and <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. With each permit holder allowed up to 15 gators, <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> is prepared to easily exceed the 130 gators skinned at the plant since it opened in 1986. `` We expect to be up non-stop from Thursday until about Monday, either skinning or hunting,'' he said. `` We're gon na be looking at a lot of dead gators.'' Some of the veteran hunters will be permitted to use the equipment at the gator house, a cement frame enclosed by screen wire and decorated by a few deer antlers and empty beer cans. A few junk cars rest nearby while the cicadas scream incessantly. But the novice trappers, randomly selected from 5,000 applications, will watch their catch be pried apart. Alligators are cut up the back to preserve the valuable hide covering the belly and underarms, said <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>. The hide, which sells for about $ 42 a foot to foreign manufacturers, is submerged in a brine solution for about a week. The excess flesh is then scraped off and the skin is sun dried. `` And we bury the innards as far away as possible,'' said <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>. `` They got a powerful smell, and if you ever cut open the stomach you better start running.'' The meat _ which <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> says makes a nice addition to spaghetti sauce _ must be frozen within several hours after the alligator is killed. One 12-foot gator bought to the plant in 1986 yielded 230 pounds of meat. `` You're fixing to eat gator for a long time with a catch like that,'' said <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, 34. Yet the gator business is just a hobby for the Dunaways and uncle <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Busby </PERSON>, 36. All will take vacation time from their jobs to process the gators. They say the best they can do charging a $ 30 fee and $ 2 a pound is break even. `` We just like it out here with the gators,'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. With state officials publicizing that a 10-foot gator could net $ 1,000 in meat and skin, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> wonders if greed rather than adventure is motivating the new hunters. `` You got to laugh when you hear these people say they're going to make money off this hunt,'' he said. `` They do n't figure in the time, expenses _ and do n't forget the danger. I'd like to see some people's faces the first time a gator takes a bite at their airboat. `` But if they want to catch'em, then we'll skin'em. We'll just say, ` Stack'em up.''' He folded his knife in a triumphant clap.

 Riot police used water cannons, birdshot and tear gas to disperse about 300 students who erected street barricades and set them afire Tuesday to protest the government of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. A television news program said said at least six protesters were arrested and several were slightly wounded. It was the second day of violent demonstrations by students from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> and adjacent <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. During Monday's demonstrations the students were protesting shortages of school supplies. Witnesses said at least four protesters suffered minor injuries when police dispersed the crowd but no arrests were reported. Both the university and <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> were closed Tuesday and the demonstrators called for the resignation of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who as commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> controls <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s civilian government On Tuesday, more than 50 riot police tried to clear the barricaded streets in the capital's downtown university zone. As the students retreated they built new barricades blocking traffic. When police charged the protesters responded with rocks. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has severe economic prolems because of sanctions opposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in an effort to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign and leave the country. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in February by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that accused him of drug trafficking.

 Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday called rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` another liberal governor coming out of nowhere'' and suggested the Democrat would advocate unilateral cuts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense muscle. The vice president, continuing on the strong defense themes he has been sounding over the past few days, sought to depict <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as inexperienced and weak on defense. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured a <LOCATION> Bendix </LOCATION> defense plant where fuel systems are made for fighter planes, and was shown a replica of the carburetor used in the World War II fighter plane he had flown in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. `` This plant keeps the muscle of our defense strong,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a group of plant employees. He suggested that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> favors `` unilateral cuts in the muscle of the defense of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The vice president earlier told a $ 500-a-ticket fund-raiser that, while he did n't `` want anything to do with tearing down'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` We should not gamble <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future on another liberal governor coming out of nowhere.'' That was a reference to former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeated his theme in a speech to an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> `` If he does n't want to modernize his snowblower, that's his concern,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, referring to the 25-year-old snowblower that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> keeps at home as a sign of his frugality. `` But if he does n't modernize our weapons systems, that puts the national security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in considerable risk.'' And he said he had `` no response, none'' to a new attack by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accusing him of being a hypocrite who sat idly by during the Iran-Contra scandal. In his <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> appearance, the vice president also warned against complacency in dealing with the Soviets _ despite recent moves by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> toward improved relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We can not adopt a naive hope that just because Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> looks different and talks different, that there are fundamental changes, because there are n't,'' he told the fund-raiser. And, in his speech at the <LOCATION> Bendix </LOCATION> plant, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I'm glad there is change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But we better not let our guard down.'' The Republican nominee, speaking at a rally at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> later in the day, praised his running mate, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who has come under close media scrutiny over allegations that he and his wealthy family pulled strings to get him into the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> at the height of the Vietnam War. `` I'm proud of my running mate,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told several thousand students. `` It's nice to have a running mate going in the same general direction as I am ... We'll do just fine.'' At the outdoor campus rally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was flanked by stock car driver <PERSON> Cale </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarborough </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and conservative <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. `` All states will be in safe hands with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as president,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, shed little light on the subject of presidential debates, a touchy topic being negotiated in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Asked whether he would commit himself to more than two debates, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` There will be debates.'' He also suggested that too many debates would be `` boring'' to voters. The fund-raising brunch earlier in the day was held at the home of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughery </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Imasco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION>'s fast-food chain. Speaking to about 150 people outside the house, on a dreary, rainy day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded that Democrats held a solid voter registration edge in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` You're talking to a guy who knows you ca n't win if you're outnumbered You need 51 percent,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The vice president said he was encouraged by recent `` polling things'' showing him to be leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` That's turned around now after our upbeat Republican convention,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I think I am more clearly spelling out why I want to be president,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 An explosion early Wednesday set off a fire and and caused extensive damage at an office building used by major anti-apartheid organizations. Bricks and glass littered the street, and a few passers-by reportedly suffered minor injuries. Police said they had no immediate indication of what caused the explosion at <ORGANIZATION> Khotso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> about 1:20 a.m. -LRB- 7:20 p.m. EDT Tuesday -RRB-. The blast was heard throughout the area. The building serves as headquarters for the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> and the Black Sash civil rights group, two of the most prominent anti-apartheid organizations not yet affected by government bans. Other church and human rights groups also have offices in the building. The South African <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> quoted witnesses as saying two people, apparently night watchmen, were in the building at the time of the explosion but escaped unhurt. The blast followed recent bombings of restaurants and other civilian targets which authorities blamed on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. Last year, a series of unsolved bombings and arson attacks on offices of anti-apartheid groups and militant black labor unions took place. Activists suggested these attacks were carried out by right-wing vigilantes, either within or outside the security forces. Bans were imposed this year on 19 anti-apartheid organizations, barring them from functioning. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Most of Former Governor's Convictions Overturned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court Tuesday overturned the nine-year sentence and most of the criminal convictions of former Guam Gov. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON>, who allegedly exchanged political favors for payoffs. In a 3-0 decision, the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said four bribery-related convictions had to be reversed because the federal crime of bribery applies only to state officials and <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> is a territory, not a state. The court also reversed four extortion-related convictions because the jury was not told that it must find <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON> demanded or otherwise induced the payoffs, totaling $ 79,600 in cash. The court ruled recently in another <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> case that extortion does not cover payments that an official accepted without either a request or an understanding that the donor would get benefits in exchange. The ruling, if it stands, would entitle <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON> to a retrial on those charges. The court upheld <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON>'s two other convictions: tampering with a witness, for asking a supporter to lie to the grand jury, and a related charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice. But according to <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON>'s lawyer, the entire nine-year prison sentence was for the extortion convictions. He was given suspended sentences on the other charges. <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON>, a Democrat elected in 1982, was indicted a few days before the 1986 Democratic primary. He won the primary but was defeated in November 1986 by Republican <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ada </PERSON>. He has been free on bail during his appeal. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON> approved government contracts and permits for various firms in exchange for payments, mostly delivered to him in unmarked envelopes. The money was described by the donors as campaign contributions or gifts, but never was reported by <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON> in his campaign statements, authorities said. He also was accused of approving a $ 103,000 government contract for a company that agreed to hire his campaign manager.

 About 15 whites were turned away Tuesday from a civil service examination for police recruits that was for blacks only, and some complained they were the victims of reverse discrimination. The test was given to 620 black men and women who had signed up to take the test at the Civic Auditorium. The whites, through a mixup, had been told to be at the auditorium too. When they showed up, they were turned away. City officials said the whites never should have been told they could take the test. The city placed an advertisement this summer in The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Union </ORGANIZATION> seeking black applicants only for police recuits because there were no blacks on the list of candidates eligible to enter the police academy. A total of 175 whites who had passed an examination in January were on the list. All the blacks who passed the exam already have entered the academy or are scheduled to enter this fall. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Rease </PERSON>, division chief for recruiting and examining, said the city held the recruiting drive because Sheriff <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> is committed to hiring more black officers. Currently, there are 900 white officers and about 200 black officers. <PERSON> Rease </PERSON> said he does n't know why whites were allowed to fill out applications to take Tuesday's test. `` My announcements said for blacks only. The applications said for blacks only,'' he said. Three white men who showed up to take the test said they were the victims of reverse discrimination. `` The first thing out of the mouth was, ` White applicants can not take the test today,''' said a man who asked that his name not be used. `` That's discrimination.''

<TEXT>
 Singer-songwriter <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springteen </PERSON>'s actress wife, <PERSON> Julianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, filed a petition for divorce Tuesday against the rock superstar, claiming `` irreconcilable differences'' with `` The Boss.'' The one-page petition filed in <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeks unspecified spousal support and says property rights will be determined later, said attorney <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Colman-Schwimmer </PERSON>, representing Miss <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 28. The Springsteens, who were married on May 13, 1985 in Miss <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' hometown of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, maintain a home in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, she said. `` Starting the divorce is simple. It's the complications that arise later that are the problems,'' Ms. <PERSON> Colman-Schwimmer </PERSON> said. A spokesman for the singer could not be reached immediately for comment, and his attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Slott </PERSON> did not immediately respond to a message. <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, called called `` The Boss'' by his fans, is known for such rock hits as `` Born To Run,'' `` Thunder Road,'' `` Because The Night,'' `` Rosalita,'' and `` Tunnel of Love,'' which he dedicated to Miss <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. They first met backstage at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION> during a concert by <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> and his E Street band in October 1984. He was riding the crest of his `` Born In The U.S.A'' tour and album, and she was an aspiring actress and model earning up to $ 2,000 a day. Rumors began floating late this spring that the couple had separated. The petition filed Tuesday did not mention a specific date. They have no children, and a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> has previously denied reports he and Miss <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> separated over the issue of starting a family. During this summer's tour to promote his latest `` Tunnel of Love'' album, <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, 38, has been linked romantically in the tabloid newspapers with red-haired E Street Band backup singer <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Scialfa </PERSON>, 36, who also was on the 1984 tour. <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Scialfa </PERSON> are both natives of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> on Tuesday vetoed a bill to make the banana slug the state mollusk, leaving a troop of Blue Birds singing the blues. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> explained in his veto message that the slug is n't Californian enough and that its reputation just does n't fit with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s image But members of the <ORGANIZATION> Redwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birds </ORGANIZATION> say the governor's grasp of mollusk lore is a bit slippery <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said the species was first identified in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and ranges as far north as <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, so it's not a true-blue Californian. Besides, the yellowish mollusk has an image that is n't befitting the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, he said. He suggested that native <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> fauna such as the pismo clam, the black abalone, the red abalone or the turban shell would make a better choice. `` If there is a need to designate a state mollusk, it would be more appropriate to select one that is indigenous to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and perhaps one that is more representative of the international reputation that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> enjoys,'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said. The Blue Birds who sponsored the campaign and the bill's author said the governor was all wet. Four of five types of banana slug are native to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopcraft </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hopcraft </PERSON> and her co-workers wore yellow armbands Tuesday to mark the bill's demise `` I think basically the banana slug has gotten a bad rap,'' she said. `` They're obviously easy to look down upon, and they do have some odd habits. Perhaps the governor looked too much at that and not their good side. `` As far as its representative qualities, it's absolutely a unique example of the diversity of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s wildlife.'' `` Yeah, he did n't know all the facts,'' said 9-year-old <PERSON> Susanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, whose Blue Bird troop worked six weeks on the bill. `` I feel really bad that he vetoed it,'' said her friend, <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, also 9. `` I mean, why did he have to do that? He did n't know anything about it. I hope he watched the news about it.'' <PERSON> Hopcraft </PERSON> said the veto is a disappointing end for the bill's young supporters `` I think this is basically the ultimate lesson for the <ORGANIZATION> Dynamite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birds </ORGANIZATION> and Camp Fire kids, that not all things have a happy ending.'' Gubernatorial vetoes can be overturned by two-thirds majorities in the <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but Assembly Republicans have vowed to block any attempts to override <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s vetoes.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ship arrived in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> Tuesday with one of two boats that were carrying $ 10 million worth of marijuana, officials reported. They said the first boat sank shortly after it was intercepted Saturday in international waters and was being towed to <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s southern coast. Coast Guard Capt. <PERSON> Dane </PERSON> <PERSON> Egli </PERSON> said the Honduras-registered, 30-foot boat <PERSON> Kiko </PERSON> was intercepted Saturday 70 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessel <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION>. `` As we towed it -LRB- the Kiko -RRB- to <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION> it sank. There were no victims but most of its cargo of marijuana disappeared in the sea.'' With the <PERSON> Kiko </PERSON>'s crew of seven Colombians aboard, the <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION> on Monday stopped the Colombia-registered <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> 11 miles south of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and detained its six Colombian crewmen. Thirteen bundles of marijuana were confiscated. `` The two loads of marijuana ... were going to be brought into <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> by the smugglers,'' said <PERSON> Egli </PERSON>. He estimated the street value of the marijuana that was on both boats at $ 10 million. The Grace Carolina and 13 Colombians were brought to <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION> Tuesday. `` We do this to earn a living because we do n't have steady work in our country,'' one of the Colombians shouted from the <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION> where he and the others were detained.

 The navy fired depth charges at what it believes was a foreign submarine prowling off west <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, a defense spokesman said Tuesday. It was not clear if the vessel was hit late Monday or escaped undamaged in the <LOCATION> Stig </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fiord </LOCATION>, 27 miles north of <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION>, said Maj.

Citing lack of proof, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> refuses to name the country it suspects of repeatedly violating its territorial waters.

<DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fifteen blind workers who make military equipment for the government at a workshop for the blind have struck the facility, demanding that they receive the same pay as their sighted co-workers. The employees walked off the job last week at the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lighthouse </LOCATION> for the Blind after they were told they would have to pay $ 65 a month for health insurance. The strikers are asking that all blind workers be given the $ 3.35-an-hour minimum wage earned by sighted employees instead of the present $ 2.05 wage. They also want company-paid health insurance. `` I think it's about time for some changes to be made,'' said <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, 28, as she walked a picket line outside the Lighthouse. `` I've been here since 1984 and there's hardly anything here for the blind. We need better opportunities.'' The 15 strikers, among 49 employees, also want assurances that their jobs and pay wo n't be affected by the walkout. Ms. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> grosses $ 320 a month, an amount supplemented by a small Social Security check. But her rent alone is $ 320 a month and she has a guide dog for whom she must pay. `` Some of -LRB- the workers -RRB- also pay $ 20 a month for transportation in the Lighthouse van,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, a former workshop employee and president of the Lubbock Chapter of the National Federation of the Blind. `` They would be losing $ 85 a month out of a $ 320-a-month income'' with the health insurance requirement. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Edlund </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, office of the National Federation of the <PERSON> Blind </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Lubbock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avalanche-Journal </ORGANIZATION> that under federal law, blind workers can be paid only 25 percent of wages paid to sighted workers. The Lighthouse, which provides jobs for blind people, is under federal contract to produce military helmet pads and chin straps. The facility's director, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>, declined to comment on the walkout or whether the strike would affect the Lighthouse's ability to fulfill the military contract. The strikers also have been circulating union cards from the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union, in hopes of gaining enough support to hold an organizing election.

 The state agency that has taken over <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>' finances warned four defiant councilmen Tuesday that unless the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> takes their side, they will be hit with criminal charges. The councilmen, who have stalled a federal judge's order to act on a housing desegregation plan, have appealed both the judge's ruling and asked for a stay of their fines until a decision comes from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> The councilmen, who personally may have to pay contempt-of-court fines of up to $ 500 a day, and the city, whose fines could go up to $ 1 million daily, applied for stays to <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who often handles such appeals from the Northeast. But a court spokesman said Tuesday afternoon the five applications were turned over to the full court. The spokesman, who asked not to be named, said he could give no indication when the court might rule. For the third time since the contempt finding, the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, at its regular meeting Tuesday night, refused to endorse the desegregation plan, which would approve incentives for 800 units of moderate-income housing throughout the city. In a packed Council chamber, Mayor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> asked if any of the councilmen wanted to change their vote but none of them did. The mayor is required by the contempt ruling to have a weekly vote on the desegregation plan. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON>, who in 1985 found the city liable for segregating schools and housing for 40 years, held the city in contempt Aug. 2 for failing to approve the housing plan. Sand imposed fines against the city that began at $ 100 a day and doubled daily. The fines were later stayed by a federal appeals court. Besides the personal fines on the four councilmen, Sand also threatened them with jail. On Friday, a federal appeals panel upheld the contempt finding but gave <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> a week to take the case to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> before reinstating the penalties. The panel also capped any daily fine at $ 1 million. The fines are slated to go back into effect Friday; the jailing of the councilmen would come Sunday. Meanwhile, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Tuesday that even if the housing dispute in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> is not a result of racial discrimination, the city's resistance to the law is unhealthy. `` We must be as intolerant of a class rejection _ because someone is poor _ as we would be of racial or religious bigotry,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. After a meeting with black leaders in <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he would be willing to meet with the four councilmen. Three of the four responded they would be happy to meet with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, while the fourth said, `` Have him call me.'' At a meeting Tuesday of the <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, its chairwoman said she will notify the district attorney that the four councilmen are breaking the law. The state watchdog agency was already in place because of money problems the city had several years ago. `` It's the city councilmen who are defying the law and putting the city's financial profile at risk, who are putting all the citizens of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> at risk,'' said <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, the chairwoman. <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> labeled the recalcitrant lawmakers `` reprehensible'' for jeopardizing the city financially. Criminal charges should `` give them pause,'' <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said of the four, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chema </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>'s remarks came a day after Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he would initiate removal proceedings and urge the jailing of the councilmen if the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused the stay. The financial control board asked City Manager <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON> to prepare a detailed phase-out plan by Thursday for the gradual elimination of city services.

 The military junta Tuesday picked President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to be the sole nominee in the presidential referendum in October, and violent demonstrations broke out in protest. Hundreds were reported arrested and a teen-age boy was shot to death. At least 19 people were reported injured. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who commands the army and took part in the selection process, was widely expected to be nominated. After his selection, he announced that the referendum will be held Oct. 5. Anti-Pinochet demonstrations raged in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and several cities during the day and grew more violent after the nomination was announced. In the capital, protesters hurled rocks, burned buses and clashed with police and with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> supporters. A hospital spokesman told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone that 15-year-old <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> was shot twice in the chest in a residential neighborhood of southwest <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. The spokesman said a 14-year-old boy also was wounded, and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperativa </ORGANIZATION> reported that he also was shot from a passing car. The station said a third person, an adult, also was wounded by a bullet. Local radio reports said the youths were participating in a pot-banging protest called by the opposition when they were hit by shots fired from a passing car. At 8 p.m., windows opened throughout <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and residents banged pots and pans to show their displeasure with the nomination. The show of defiance was organized by a 16-party opposition coalition. Also, evening blackouts were reported in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> suburbs both north and south of the city, as well as in the coastal city of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Serena </LOCATION> 290 miles north of the capital. Authorities did not disclose the cause of the power losses, but bombing of power transmission towers is commonly carried out by leftist guerrilla groups to protest government actions. Local radio stations reported protesters clashing with police in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s outlying slums during the night. The demonstrators erected barricades of burning car tires to prevent police from entering the neighborhoods. Protests began nationwide about noon, when the military leaders convened to formally choose <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> for a the presidential referendum. A police spokesman, Capt. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sierra </PERSON>, said 19 people were injured during the <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> disturbances. Two police officers were among the injured, one of whom was reported in serious condition, <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> said. He said police detained 364 protesters who would be held overnight and then released. He said they included a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, but said authorities would not release his name or that of any of the other people arrest. He said four public buses were set afire and destroyed by demonstrators, who also hurled rocks at police. There were brief clashes between groups of pro- and anti-Pinochet civilian groups. If voters approve <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 72, his term will run until 1997. If the voters reject him, open elections are to be held in 1990 and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will remain president until then. `` This is a decisive moment in the institutional process begun Sept. 11, 1973,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said in his acceptance speech. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> led the bloody coup in September 1973 that ousted the government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, who died in the palace takeover. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has been president of the military government since then. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was nominated by himself, <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> chief Adm. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, air force leader Gen. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON> and national police director Gen. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stange </PERSON> in a one-hour 45-minute nomination session in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> later appeared on a balcony of the government palace and addressed about 10,000 cheering supporters. He said his years of rule have been dedicated to forging a Chilean society in which a new type of democracy, with tough safeguards against communism, will be established. `` The full democracy that approaches constitutes a new challenge for everyone,'' he said. `` It also will demand of us all overcoming, adapting and rectifying to create a new style of political coexistence,'' he said. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is backed by his army, which is by far the most powerful military service, and has campaigned for months for popular support. Opposition politicians immediately denounced the selection. `` The nomination of Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, with his own vote, as candidate to succeed himself, is the best denial of the supposed democratic intentions of the regime,'' the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said in a written statement. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s nomination was announced by air force Gen. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Montero </PERSON>, secretary for the nominating session. He said the commanders designated <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> `` as the person who, pending citizen ratification, occupies the position of president of the republic for the -LRB- eight-year -RRB- presidential period beginning March 11, 1989.'' There were anti-government demonstrations in downtown <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and also in Conception and <LOCATION> Osorno </LOCATION> in the south and and in the centrl port city of <LOCATION> Valparaiso </LOCATION>. More than a thousand youths marched through downtown <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and riot police sent them fleeing with tear gas and water cannons. But the protesters regrouped and continued their marches during the afternoon. Some of the demonstrators carried pictures of leftists who disappeared after being arrested by security agents. Beneath the pictures were the words: `` Where are they?.'' Police said several bomb threats had been receivwed and they deactivated two explosive devices, one left in a black plastic bag a block from the government house. More than 7.2 million <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s 8 million elegible voters have registered to participate in the referendum.

 Even drastic cutbacks in the release of the chemicals blamed for causing the global `` greenhouse effect'' are unlikely to halt the heating of the planet, according to a new climate analysis. The greenhouse effect has been widely discussed recently, although most meteorologists contend that it is too early to determine if it is responsible for the current drought and hot weather affecting much of the nation. The effect occurs when carbon dioxide, largely from burning fossil fuels, and other gases increase in the atmosphere. These gases let incoming heat from the sun reach the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> but they reflect outgoing heat, keeping it from traveling back into space. That traps heat, much like a greenhouse traps heat indoors. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the lead author of the new study, told a congressional subcommittee earlier in the summer that the current hot, dry conditions are an example of things to come.

 A group of climate researchers has warned that the `` greenhouse effect'' warming of the Earth will continue even if there are sharp cutbacks in the use of the chemicals which cause the problem. The heatup `` appears to be inevitable, even with ... drastic, and probably unrealistic reductions, of greenhouse forcing'' by the release of carbon dioxide and other gases, the scientists reported in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres. The group, led by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, reached that conclusion after running computerized climate models in an effort to predict the climate in the future.

<HEAD>Scholars See Moral Issue In Quayle-Vietnam Furor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Religious ethicists say the central moral question about Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s conduct as a young man during the Vietnam War period is whether his actions squared with his attitude. Some see inconsistency between his stated support for the war at that time, while virtually assuring he would n't be involved in it by joining the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> when he faced being drafted. Several theologians said in interviews that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as a youth may not have understood the implications then, and that motivations are nebulous, but his course appears equivocal on the surface. The case was termed due for analysis in some ethics courses this fall. `` It borders on hypocrisy, and it's certainly not heroic, but none of us fully takes the consequences of his or her beliefs all the time,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Union Theological Seminary. `` There comes a time when the chips are down that you've got to live up to your convictions and take the costs. But you ca n't get involved in every fight that comes along, even if you believe in it. You muddle through, sit one out.'' <PERSON> Shinn </PERSON>, a teacher of Christian ethics for a quarter century, counseled troubled students during the Vietnam War. He noted some opposed it, paying for it by going to jail, while some supported it and died in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` Either way, they paid the costs,'' he said. `` That's what real integrity is. Whether you agree with a person or not, acting with integrity means taking a stand and willingness to suffer for it.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says he entered the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> so as to go to law school. `` I did not join to avoid service in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' he says. He says he `` supported the goals of fighting communism in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' and disliked the `` no-win policy aspect.'' Ethicists say the issue was not his entering the Guard, which many war opponents did to avoid the draft, and not mainly whether he used family influence to do it, but whether he practiced what he preached. `` If you believe one way, you have to act consistently with it or your ethical stance collapses,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> psychologist <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Th Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who teaches <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> ethics at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said if <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was `` really honest about it, he would come clean that he was dodging the draft. `` The real issue is one of honesty and straightforwardness. If he supported <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and then tried to get out of it, it was hypocritical to the core. It was not a matter of conscience, but of expediency.'' Moral philosopher <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s course raises `` a small question mark about his integrity.'' `` But it's relatively minor,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` It's not worth all the hullabaloo. I have doubts about how strong his convictions were on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Maybe he should have sought to go there and help the cause. `` But he chose not to for reasons we do n't fully understand. You ca n't judge guilt from the outside, but should give a person the benefit of the doubt. Young men make mistakes. We're all entitled to be wrong sometimes. `` He may now regret it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> moral theologian <PERSON> Germain </PERSON> <PERSON> Grisez </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Emmitsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said it is not clearly inconsistent for people to favor `` fighting a war, but not particularly want to be in it themselves. `` Very often people want their dirty work done, but do n't want to do it themselves. I'm not sure it's wrong, and not sure it's all right either. It's a question of fairness, of being unfair to other people by shirking. `` It's clearly not heroic character, but that does not mean it's immoral. Rabbi <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON>, an ethical scholar and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregations </ORGANIZATION>, said there `` seems to be quite a distance'' between what <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` professes and what he does. `` Obviously one should not proclaim what he fails to do. If his words belie his deeds, he becomes a hypocrite. Actions should come close to ideals. Yet nobody's actions reflect the ideal totally. Everybody fails it sometimes.'' The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burtchaell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> said people may see <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s `` strong view of the war as in conflict with his public action ... I do n't think he's profound enough to be hypocritical.'' Episcopal moral theologian <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said `` the meaning of actions and statements always have to be interpreted. I do n't know how to say his are consistent, but I reckon that he does. `` Typically there is more than one way to look at it.''

 `` Dynasty'' is n't exactly turning into a bastion of high morality, but its new producer promises more meaningful relationships than affairs this season, and more ginger ale than gin-and-tonics. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON>, named executive producer of the show as it begins its ninth season, said he's betting that more realism, more action and some new characters will attract more viewers _ even as the characters clean up their acts. `` I do n't think people will be popping in and out of every bed,'' he said. `` In the age of herpes and AIDS, it's irresponsible to have flagrant bed hopping and I do n't think we ought to do it.'' He promised that men and women would develop less ephemeral relationships, and there would be less smoking and drinking on `` Dynasty.'' `` We're going to cut that down, because I just do n't think it's healthy,'' <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON> said, although he cautioned that any one show should not be used as a barometer of societal changes <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> auditioning actors and actresses for the show, is no stranger to glamorous prime-time soaps. He spent five years writing or directing more than 50 episodes of `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' He also was supervising producer of `` Knots Landing'' for one year. `` Dynasty'' finished the 1987-88 television season ranked 37th out of 85 regularly scheduled series. Although he is planning some new wrinkles for `` Dynasty,'' <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON> said some of the strengths of the past will be revived. `` We'll see the character of <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> Carrington </LOCATION> -RRB- be a driving force again. The character was allowed to weaken,'' he said. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> will `` lead the charge'' of men with stronger personalities, he said. `` The women have always been the stronger force,'' he added. Also, there will be more action in the episodes, and, he said, `` we're going to tell a faster story.'' One of the new characters will be a young detective, `` a street guy somewhere between <PERSON> Serpico </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>,'' he said. And although there will be plenty of elegant clothing, diamonds and fancy place settings, there will be more people from other walks of life, `` people who even live without air conditioning,'' <PERSON> Paulsen </PERSON> said. Thus, viewers will see more of what it is like when the rich encounter the poor, experiences projected from the typewriters of three new writers, two of whom were reporters until this year, he said. The changes in the show are aimed at higher ratings. But he said the effort to clean up the lifestyles of his characters came from his desire to reflect changing values in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And he insists that television shows can affect the way viewers live. He recalled that once, in a scene of a television sitcom, a character in a car made passing mention of fastening seatbelts. `` For four or five days afterward, police departments noticed a distinct drop in fatalities and serious injuries,'' he said. `` It was a very humbling experience that showed that although we're not out to preach, there are subtle things you can do.''

<HEAD>Briton in Competition to Become West's First Chess Millionaire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lying on the floor in his north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> apartment, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> shook his head, smiled, and parried the suggestion he might become the West's first chess millionaire. On Aug. 23, the 31-year-old grandmaster became the first player to reach the semifinals of the World Chess Championship, which puts him only two victories away from a 1990 title match with the reigning world champion, <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He will not know his semi-finals opponent until the three remaining quarterfinals matches are played in January. No British player has ever reached such an advanced stage of this competition. Ten years ago, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had no chess grandmasters and chess was far from a big-money competition. But corporate sponsors and paying spectators have put top players in the financial big leagues. The loser of the 1990 world championship duel will be guaranteed three-eighths of the expected $ 2 million prize fund. The 1987 world face-off between <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, had a winners' pot totaling $ 1.85 million. As an added incentive, the West German computer company <ORGANIZATION> Mephisto </ORGANIZATION> will give 1 million Swiss francs -LRB- $ 637,000 -RRB- to the first Westerner to challenge <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>. But the 6-foot, 3-inches tall <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> said in an interview that money `` is not my major consideration.'' For <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON>, chess is an intellectual pursuit and he remains determined not to own a car or television. His 3 -LCB- - to-1 -LCB- victory in the quarterfinals over fellow Briton <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON>, 23, the world's third ranked player and pre-match favorite, netted <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> a $ 21,250 prize, his biggest ever But critics fear his disarmingly peaceful disposition and non-competitive approach are n't winning ingredients. `` He's got to become less modest,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisdall </PERSON>, an American international master who lives in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and served as an adviser to <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> in the quarterfinals. <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> admits feeling sorry for his opponents. `` Of course I always want to win, but I do n't want my opponent to lose,'' he said. In contrast to <PERSON> Short </PERSON>, who left school at 16 and once played in a rock-group called `` The Urge,'' or the flamboyant <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, who employs a Western business manager, <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> appears as the stereotype intellectual chess player. Bearded and bespectacled, he studied mathematics at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and, after earning his grandmaster title in 1980, took a year's break from the game to learn Russian. <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> writes poetry and enjoys word games. Competing in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> this year, he was delighted when a friend in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> sent him <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> crossword by facsimile. He has also been involved in political battles. In May 1986, he took part in a demonstration outside <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Theater </PERSON> on the opening night of the musical `` Chess'' to lend support to <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulko </PERSON>, a leading Soviet grandmaster, in his campaign to gain exit visas to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for his family <PERSON> Gulko </PERSON>, who once went on a 40-day hunger strike, received his emigration papers several months later and now lives in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Last year, <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> jointly hosted a simultaneous chess exhibition to raise money for medical supplies for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> has spent up to six months a year abroad and his knowledge of Russian has helped build friendships. International Master <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON>'s creativity makes him the `` most difficult of opponents to predict. He first learned the chess moves at age 6. At 13, he won the British under-14 championship and since then his career has been marked by a gradual, but consistent improvement. In 1986, in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, he was ranked fifth among <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s grandmasters and played for the <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> team that won the silver medal in the biennial chess Olympiad. In the last two years, however, <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> said, a `` a quantum jump'' took him to fifth ranked player in the world. He said he does n't know what happened. He just got better. `` Chess is basically scientific but there is also a strong psychological and artistic side,'' he said. `` Because it's so intense, you can reach parts of yourself which you would n't very often, a higher state of mind perhaps.'' On his way to meet <PERSON> Short </PERSON>, <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> overwhelmed the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> player, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Seirawan </PERSON>, by a score of 4-1 in a six-game match.

 On his visit to this kingdom surrounded by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> will come here to a sacred mountain where a French missionary helped native people threatened by white men more than 100 years ago. Later on during his stop in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> on his five-nation tour of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> Sept. 10-19, the pontiff will beatify the Roman Catholic missionary, the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON>. At <LOCATION> Thaba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bosiu </LOCATION> on Sept. 14, the pontiff will meet King <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> II on the same spot where King <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> I in 1862 first welcomed Christian missionaries to his land, torn by internal violence and threatened by the surrounding white <PERSON> Boers </PERSON>, the settlers of what today is <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> was one of the missionaries, who traveled through the mountains on horseback wrapped in wool blankets as the Basotho -LRB- the people of <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> -RRB- still do. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> climbed the rocky, natural fortress of <LOCATION> Thaba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bosiu </LOCATION> _ `` The Mountain of the Night'' in the local language _ several times during the 1865-68 conflict with the white <PERSON> Boers </PERSON>, sneaking past them to bring food and encouragement to the thousands of Basotho crowded onto the top of the 600-foot-high plateau. The missionaries persuaded <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> I to seek protection from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>. As a result, Basutoland, as the area was called, became a British protectorate and was saved from annexation into what was later to become <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Basutoland became independent <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> in 1966. The 12,134-square-mile kingdom _ about half the size of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> _ has almost no industry, only one-third of its land is arable, and it relies heavily on the earnings of 140,000 Basotho men who work in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which is not on the pope's itinerary. The pope will beatify <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> during a Mass at a racetrack near here on Sept. 15 before departing next day for <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>. The pontiff will not go to the summit of <LOCATION> Thaba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bosiu </LOCATION>, the royal burial ground, where residents say a large dune of fine, red sand at the summit contains the spirit of the first king, and like him, never leaves the mountaintop. When the dune approaches the edge, upward drafts of wind blow it back. King <PERSON> Moshoeshoe </PERSON> I discovered the mountain refuge in 1824 and gathered feuding, destitute, and some cannibalistic tribes together to found the Basotho nation. He welcomed the missionaries, and spent his last years trying to choose whether to become a Catholic or a Protestant. When he died without making a decision, <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> wrote, `` I have never felt such great sorrow in my life.'' The present king is Catholic, as are 70,000 other Basotho. Ninety percent of the population of 1,443,853 are <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>; the rest are animists. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> died in 1914, after working for 52 years among the Basotho, establishing schools, a hospital and a church, supervising the printing of books in the Sesotho language and converting <ORGANIZATION> Basotho </ORGANIZATION> to Catholicism. His mission at <ORGANIZATION> Roma </ORGANIZATION> is now run by a French Canadian, the Rev. <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jalbert </PERSON>, who gave up horseback riding a few years ago. He supervised construction of a chapel over <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON>'s grave, chopped down trees and prepared rest quarters for the pope's entourage.

The pope will visit <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON>'s grave, from which local people have been taking dirt for decades to sprinkle on their crops, homes and children to bring good fortune. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> is being beatified, the first step toward sainthood, because of the healing of a 6-year-old blind girl in 1928, 14 years after his death. Doctors could n't cure <LOCATION> Florina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phakela </LOCATION>, so a priest at the <ORGANIZATION> Roma </ORGANIZATION> mission had a bag of soil from <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON>'s grave tied around her neck and told her mother to pray for nine days. The girl, who died in 1982, told <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> investigators she was visited in the night by a priest who told her she was cured. When she woke in the morning, her sight restored, she went to the mission to thank the priest, but could n't find him. She identified a picture of <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> as the one who had visited her.

<HEAD>Jews and Human Rights Leaders Hail Argentine Anti-Discrimination
Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Human rights leaders and Jews are hailing a new law that imposes fines or jail sentences on anyone convicted of discrimination based on race, religion or sex. They call it a significant advance in the protection of civil liberties in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. `` We think the law has extraordinary social and political significance for Argentine society,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, president of the Delegation of Argentine Israelite Associations. `` There was a gap in previous legislation in that there was no penalty for those who did discriminate,'' said <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, a medical doctor whose organization is the largest of several that represent the estimated 400,000 Jews in this South American country. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazara </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> congressman and a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The law is not solely aimed at anti-Semitism, but also at discrimination based on color or creed, or against the native -LRB- Indian -RRB- communities.'' The legislation was introduced early in 1984 by President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, who co-founded and ran the <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> before he was elected to office in October 1983. His inauguration seven weeks later ended a harsh, nearly eight-year military dictatorship. As reworked and finally approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in August, the new law penalizes anyone who `` arbitrarily blocks, obstructs or restricts ... the full exercise ... of fundamental rights and guarantees.'' <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s Constitution of 1853 as amended protects the right to assembly, universal suffrage and freedom of speech and worship, although Roman Catholicism is the country's official religion and only Catholics can hold the nation's presidency and vice presidency. The law punishes by jail up to three years anyone convicted of belonging to an organization that promotes the superiority of one race or color or creed over another. Anyone convicted of a crime or offense committed `` in persecution or hatred of a race, religion or nationality, or with the intent to destroy ... a national, ethnic, racial or religious group,'' could be sentenced to additional fines or prison. The law also requires restitution in cases of property damage. `` Overall, the new law constitutes a vision of the new democracy in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, reflecting the conditions that have existed since the end of the last military dictatorship,'' <PERSON> Lazara </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s century-old tradition of democracy has been tarnished by six military interventions since 1930, including coups that ousted Gen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> in 1955, two civilian presidents in the 1960s, and <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>'s wife Isabel in 1976. More than 9,000 Argentines, most of them sons and daughters of the middle class, `` disappeared'' and are presumed dead following their arrests in the late 1970s by security forces trying to crush the Montonero urban guerrillas and leftist political opposition in general. Discrimination usually is not overt, but it is pervasive. Darker skinned Argentines of Indian descent, while not barred from white-collar jobs, more commonly are manual laborers. Very few Jews are in the army. Women are paid less than men for doing the same job. Anti-Semitism in recent years has been reflected by the knocking over of Jewish tombstones in cemeteries, the painting of anti-Semitic graffitti on walls and, very infrequently but always intimidating, the setting off of small bombs in the doorways of synagogues. `` We do n't have a very serious problem of discrimination based on religion or race, but there is, in the background, among certain sectors, some anti-Semitism,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s press secretary <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Grushka </PERSON>, leader of the leftist Federation of Jewish Cultural Entities, said the new law is helpful, but he added tha the wished the acts of discrimination that would invoke the penalties were more precisely spelled out. `` We still have to work very hard on the judicial level to make sure that anti-Semitic actions are punished,'' <PERSON> Grushka </PERSON> said. Anti-discrimination legislation in Argentine law dates to 1949. In 1964, similar legislation that penalized those convicted of discrimination was implemented, but that legislation was revoked by the military government that came to power two years later.

 `` We intend to stay together.'' So declared representatives of l47 mostly North American and <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denominations 40 years ago. `` Christ has made us his own, and he is not divided,'' said that 1948 founding assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. `` In seeking him we find one another.'' Their pact has grown to include 307 denominations of virtually all Christian traditions of every race and continent, East and West, totaling more than 400 million members. Its formation amid the ruins of World War II raised an ecumenical landmark in the cause of Christian unity. `` It is the great new fact of our time,'' said the late Archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Willilam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>. That mid-century coming together of Christians signalled a reversal of more than 400 years of church fragmentation, antagonism and rivalry in the West and 1,000 years of uncommunicative separation from churches of the East. Results have `` overcome centuries of indifference and even hatred among Christians,'' affirming that `` we are one people,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, council general secretary. Now actively allied, they jointly probe their differences, dissolving mutual misconceptionsealing of the documents by <PERSON> Kenkel </PERSON>, who then directed them to be made public July 18 but gave the government 10 days to appeal the decision. At the same time, <PERSON> Kenkel </PERSON> said the more sensitive affidavits used to support the request for the warrants could remain secret for 45 more days. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, noting that there was no disagreement that the information should eventually be made public, said the real dispute was over timing. He said all the documents should stay sealed the same amount of time.

 In the year since he lost his legs trying to block a trainload of munitions, <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Willson </PERSON> has become a symbol of inspiration in the movement for peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Hundreds have been stirred to maintain ` round-the-clock protests at the <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weapons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> since last Sept. 1, the day the slow-moving <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> train, under orders not to stop, rolled over <PERSON> Willson </PERSON> as he sat on the tracks The demonstrators, surrounded by picket signs, sleeping bags and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags, stand by as trains and trucks carry weapons across <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION>, which cuts through the base. `` Because of what I chose to do and what the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> chose to do, I'm a symbol and that can be used for good, I think,'' <PERSON> Willson </PERSON>, 47, said this week in an interview at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Practice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nonviolence </ORGANIZATION>, which he founded with his wife, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauen </PERSON>. The soft-spoken <PERSON> Willson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran born on the Fourth of July and raised in a conservative, politically inactive family in <LOCATION> Ashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said he's more convinced than ever of the need to campaign for peace and a halt to weapons shipments to Central American nations. `` I do n't think it was a mistake and I do n't regret what I did. I'm sorry the train ran over me and that I lost my legs. It's a drag,'' he said. `` I feel more liberated than ever to speak the truth, so I do n't have any desire or wish to back off,'' he said. In the past year, <PERSON> Willson </PERSON> has spoken across the country. At the scene of the accident 40 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, demonstrations, prayers, rallies and civil disobedience still elicit headlines, thanks to high-profile protesters such as the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>, author <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> and peace activist <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellsberg </PERSON>. An ecumenical service will be held at the weapons station Thursday to mark the anniversary of <PERSON> Willson </PERSON>'s maiming. It will be the first time since June 10 that <PERSON> Willson </PERSON> has visited the spot where he inspires protesters but riles many of the 450 people in the adjacent town of <LOCATION> Clyde </LOCATION>, who have grown weary of the sight and sound of demonstrators on their doorstep. When demonstrators posted a handmade sign reading `` <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>,'' made to look like the town sign of `` Clyde'' across the road from the base gates, residents were outraged. The sign came down after a session with a county mediator. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Elam </PERSON> is typical of most townspeople today. He complains the protest site is an eyesore and demonstrators are `` left-wing radicals who sympathize with communist governments.'' The protesters meet with a wide range of responses. Earlier this week, 19-year-old <PERSON> Spaulding </PERSON> <PERSON> Brook </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> was leaning on the base fence near a sign reading `` Wage Peace'' when a man drove past, blared `` Boo'' through a megaphone and gestured obscenely. A carload of men yelled, `` Go home.'' Others driving by flash peace signs. The county has spent about $ 335,000 for patrols of <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Costa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION>'s deputies, who have arrested some 325 people since last Sept. 1, according to Sgt. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Sizemore </PERSON>. Tired of the marathon protest and concerned about safe transportation of explosives across a 200-foot intersection, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> wants to build a $ 10 million overpass to takes vehicles over the highway, said base spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikalsky </PERSON>. While the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> seeks funding from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, others have turned to the courts. County prosecutors have failed to convict any protesters. <PERSON> Willson </PERSON> has sued the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the crew of the train that refused to stop, and the crew has countersued. The Northern California chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> sued to stop use of a painful choke hold on protesters being arrested. A federal court rejected a county request for permission to remove protesters' tables, chairs and picket signs from the edge of the highway. So the demonstrators remain, suffering occasional attacks with eggs, bottles and obscenities. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodmacher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diablo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, which helps coordinate the protests, says the local antagonism is ironic because, in 1986, voters only narrowly rejected a measure urging the government to halt arms shipments through the county until there was a regional peace settlement in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillard </PERSON> is one of the few locals who have joined the protests. Her car has been painted with swastikas, pelted with eggs and had its tires flattened. `` I wish they -LRB- protest opponents -RRB- could get to know us better before making a judgment,'' <PERSON> Hillard </PERSON> said. `` It's unfortunate to live in a community with fears of getting your house burned down.''

 How many times have the rumors spread through some nightspot _ `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>'s supposed to show up.'' This time it's no rumor. <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> is due here soon for a very rare interview. The site of this event is <LOCATION> Il </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cielo </LOCATION>, a lovely <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> restaurant. The violin music is soothing, but it does n't block out memories of `` Do n't Look Back,'' the 1967 documentary that included <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>'s razor-tongued evisceration of a hapless magazine reporter, or the more recent snippet in the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> 20th anniversary TV special that showed <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> bitterly complaining about fans who dare to approach him because his songs have touched them `` That has nothin' to do with me,'' he griped. <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> does n't make an entrance, he materializes, slipping in through a back entrance. He is polite, subdued, nervous about doing an interview. After settling in a chair, he checks all around him like a skittish colt suddenly released into an unfamiliar corral. He puts the ubiquitous sunglasses on the table, quietly dismisses mineral water, accepts white wine, asks, `` Will it bother you if I smoke?'' Invited to go ahead, he takes out a pack of Salems. He says he quits occasionally. He sits forward and answers questions earnestly, looking directly at the interviewer with his big, blue eyes. <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> looks fit at 47, and he is n't slowing down. He's on his third tour in as many years, just released `` Down in the Groove,'' his seventh LP in eight years and is already thinking of another for next year when he also hopes to tour the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He's also planning to launch a movie and TV production company He has just completed three high-energy, sell-out performances at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' Greek Theatre. Since going on the road in June, <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> is proving that, far from being over the hill, he's at the top of his form. The tour has drawn critical raves and has been extended at least through Oct. 16-19, when he'll do a four-night stand at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Radio City Music Hall, his first performance at the legendary theater Backed by a tight, three-piece rock band led by guitarist G.E. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of `` Saturday Night Live'' renown, <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> has rejuvenated his classic material, resurrecting such timeless gems as `` Boots of Spanish Leather,'' `` Times They Are A-Changin''' and `` Masters of War.'' `` When I'm singin' my songs, it never occurs to me that I wrote them,'' <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> says. `` If I did n't have a song like ` Masters of War,' I'd find a song like ` Masters of War' to sing. Same thing with ` Times They are A-Changin'.' If I did n't have a song like that, I'd go out and look around and I'd search around until I found one like that, you know?'' There's a line in `` Masters of War'' about being afraid to bring children into the world. <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, now divorced, has five. `` I do n't sing that line,'' he jokes. `` I love children. I was always taught that if you were blessed to have them, you just had more of them. They're protection from the world.'' His eldest daughter just married, suggesting a possible new phase in his life. The rebel voice of the 1960s is after all nearing 50. `` I would n't mind being a grandfather, or a great-grandfather for that matter,'' he says, `` but I do n't know if that has anything to do with age. I know people in their 30s who are grandparents. I do n't know how old I am. I mean, people tell me how old I am, but I have no way of knowing if they're tellin' me the truth or not.'' When his children were young, he moved them from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to protect them from the effects of fame and `` so they could grow up in a little more country environment, at least hear the birds singing.'' `` There's just something instinctive that tells me that a man must support his family, no matter what. As it is, I'm doing what I do because I've been given to do it,'' he says. `` But most of the people who work 9 to 5 have got to support families, and there's a tremendous disregard for that. You do n't see much of that being heralded with heroic words and fancy awards But that's what makes the world either rise or fall, that commitment to family.'' The lead song on `` Down in the Groove'' _ the <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> blues song, `` Let's Stick Together'' _ echoes that sentiment: `` It might be tough for a while, you might consider the child. Can not be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together ...'' The album surprised some critics because it is mostly covers of other composers' songs. There are only two <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> originals, plus two collaborations with Grateful Dead songwriter <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, including the single `` Silvio.'' <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> said he picked the other material because he liked it. `` Down in the Groove'' establishes <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> as a recording artist with the strength of style to transcend the source of the material. `` There's no rule that claims that anyone must write their own songs,'' he says. `` And I do. I write a lot of songs. But so what, you know? You could take another song somebody else has written and you can make it yours. I'm not saying I made a definitive version of anything with this last record, but I liked the songs. Every so often you've got ta sing songs that're out there. You just have to, just to keep yourself straight.'' The other reason for the others is inevitable: He did n't have enough material of his own for an album. `` Writing is like such an isolated thing. You're in such an isolated frame of mind,'' he says. `` You have to get into or be in that place. In the old days, I could get to it real quick. I ca n't get to it like that no more It's not that simple. `` I mean, just being able to shut yourself off for long periods of time, where you're so isolated no one can get to you, mentally or physically, you know? You need to be able to do that in order to come up with that kind of stuff. `` You're always capable of it in your youth and especially if you're an unknown and nobody cares _ like if you're an anonymous person. But once that all ends, then you have to create not only what you want to do, but you have to create the environment to do it in, which is double-hard.

 `` I do n't write about things,'' he says. `` I write from inside of something, and I sing and play the same way. It's never about that ` something,' hoping to touch it. It's rather from the inside of it reaching out.'' <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> said he does have five or six songs for a new album. And he's part of an incognito group, The Willburys, that includes <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> and has an album coming out later this year. In the past few years, he's concentrated on touring _ with the Grateful Dead, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> and the Heartbreakers, now with this pared-down band that has <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> alone out front most of the time, performing selections from the vast catalog of an almost 30-year career. Nobody would blame him for just putting his feet up for a while. `` I really do n't have anyplace to put my feet up,'' he laughs. `` Well, we want to play'cause we want to play. ... Why tour? It's just that you get accustomed to it over the years The people themselves will tell you when to stop touring.'' This tour has brought <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> the critical praise that seems tougher for him to come by than it is for other artists. He seems to be held up to a higher standard because of his own bigger-than-life image, and that irritates him. `` It's irritating. It's real irritating,'' he says. `` It's not that somebody ca n't come and not like what you're doing, that's OK. But I've done tours before where people got real personal with their reviews in a real early time when we were on the road, and for some reason all the towns that we were about to play, they'd like to pick these things up So it was like intentionally telling people to stay away. `` I do n't know. I go through a lot of that, and then even when you're not doing what they say you're doing, people expect to see that. It's like when we were playing after being booed in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> or something -LRB- in 1965 he brought an electric band to the folk festival -RRB-. I mean, for the next six months, people want to see that same show that got booed, and they want to boo, too.'' He is interrupted: Does he have a request for the restaurant's violinist Sure, he says, `` Love Me or Leave Me.'' <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>'s unexpected tastes and perspectives often perplex his public, though he insists he is not, as frequently described, `` enigmatic.'' `` I do n't know what that word means,'' he protests. `` I would like to think that I could n't be categorized. Who wants to be categorized? That happens because of all the stuff I do, not because of who I am or anything. And I do n't even know if that's a true fact because that's nothing much to concern me. You ca n't make it too long on being an enigma.'' If his critics ca n't categorize him, they certainly ca n't accuse him of playing it safe. He seems to depend on literary and spiritual references that keep him constantly searching for new influences. He stunned the public in 1979 when he came out with the emotional, gospel LP `` Slow Train Coming.'' The lead song, `` Got ta Serve Somebody,'' won him his only Grammy, an honor he considers `` an accident.'' The album was one of <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>'s strongest ever and went platinum -LRB- 1 million copies sold -RRB-. `` Gospel music is about the love of God. And commercial music is about the love of sex,'' <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> says. After following up with `` Saved'' and `` Shot of Love,'' <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, who was born Jewish, seemed to drift away from the Christian message, though themes of redemption tinged `` Infidels'' and `` Empire Burlesque.'' His current religious leanings are the object of speculation. `` Religion has nothing to do with faith,'' is all he'll say publicly on the subject. But another of his gospel songs, `` Death Is Not the End,'' turned up on `` Down in the Groove.'' So did the Tin Pan Alley tune `` When Did You Leave Heaven?'' And at a recent concert he delighted the crowd by bursting into `` I'm in the Mood for Love. Last year, he appeared on a PBS tribute to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>. He was surprised when the producers invited him to participate. `` I said, ` Are you sure? You sure there might not be another <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>?''' <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> has always been intrigued by <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>'s music, he says, ``'cause it sounds like sophisticated city stuff, but there's a country, backwood, alley cat element to it that for some reason he was able to capture. `` There are smells and tastes in those songs for some reason. And I was used to hearing <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> sing a lot of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON> songs a few years back, and they were very close to the folk songs that I was singing.'' Folk songs have an honored place in <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>'s current repertoire, a purposeful homage to his roots. He plays the standards `` <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'' and `` Golden Vanities'' on stage, and included his own arrangement of `` Shenandoah'' on `` Down in the Groove.'' Earlier this year, he was inducted into the Rock' n' Roll Hall of Fame and played `` Like a Rolling Stone,'' the anthem of the rock generation, at the ceremony. But folk music is in his heart. He contributed a cut to the recent LP honoring <PERSON> Leadbelly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>. Born <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> _ he later legally changed his name _ <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> migrated to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in part to visit <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> in the hospital. He soon became a sensation playing his songs of biting social commentary in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> coffee houses. But he infuriated folk purists when he took up the electric guitar by the mid - Ironically, <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> is now in a better position than the purists to champion folk music in the'80s. `` People do n't know folk songs anymore,'' he says. `` I mean, hardly anybody sings them anymore, and people think that people who play the acoustic guitar and write their own songs are folk singers, but that's not necessarily true. They're writing their own songs, but they're not really based on anything. So I thought, well, if I'm going around again, I'm going to sing folk songs, because first of all, I love'em, and the lyrics in them are _ I mean, they're incredible stories, and that's where I got a lot of my stuff from in the early years _ and still do. Folk songs are still better, even though they're not commercial, they're still better than 90 percent of the stuff you hear on the radio. `` Have you ever seen a Shakespeare play? I mean, it's like the English language at its peak where one line will come out like a stick of dynamite, and you'll be so what-was-that! But then the other stuff is rolling on so fast you ca n't even think, and then you have to struggle to catch up to where you are in the present. And folk songs are pretty much like the same way. `` Of course, nobody writes like <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> either,'' he said. `` But, you know, it do n't matter. Those things can still be performed. They do n't have to be written _ just like folk songs.''

<HEAD>Less Wheat Needed to Buy Foreign Oil, but Expert Says It Won't
Last</HEAD>

 It takes less <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> wheat to buy a barrel of <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> oil this year, but do n't bet the farm that this will last forever, or even to the turn of the century. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, about 4.3 bushels of wheat are required to buy a barrel of oil, a little more than half of the grain that was needed just three years ago. But over the long haul, says institute president <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the odds `` seem certain to favor the oil exporters'' because they are dealing in a non-renewable commodity, compared with wheat, which can be planted every year. `` Another surge in oil prices is likely sometime during the early'90s,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` When it comes, it will throw the terms of trade decidedly in favor of oil exporters.'' In his view, countries that sell grain and import oil should be investing in automobile fuel efficiency and seeking alternatives to the car and petroleum-based fuel. `` For the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, basic policy measures such as the imposition of a gasoline tax and the extension of auto fuel-efficiency standards will help minimize the effect of the next major shift in the wheat-oil exchange rate,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is a private, non-profit research organization which studies global problems, often focusing on agriculture and the food supply. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s comments about wheat and oil were in the current issue of World Watch magazine. `` The economic fortunes of nations rise and fall with shifts in the exchange rate between two widely traded commodities, grain and oil,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Grain directly supplies half of the calories the world's people consume, and indirectly supplies part of the remainder in the form of grain-fed meat, milk and eggs. Oil accounts for more than 40 percent of commercial energy use. Exports of these dominant commodities are concentrated in a handful of countries, with grain coming mostly from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and oil from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which dominates grain exports even more than <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> does oil, is both the world's leading grain exporter and oil importer,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` And, ironically, all 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are grain importers.'' Several trends have converged to boost grain prices, he said. Millions of acres of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmland have been abandoned or retired under federal programs to protect highly erodible soil. Worldwide, the area planted in grain is shrinking at a time when food demands are rising. Drought also has been a factor across much of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year, and in 1987 in the Indian subcontinent. Grain prices have risen sharply. `` Oil prices, meanwhile, have remained stable, despite <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> attempts to raise them by urging non-member oil exporting countries to also curb production,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` As a result the wheat-oil exchange rate has been falling somewhat during 1988.'' In the near term, he said, the advantage to grain exporters is providing `` a modest redress for the losses they suffered in the volatile oil market of the'70s.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the 1970s `` upset the remarkably stable rate of exchange'' that had existed between grain and oil during the third quarter of the 20th century. `` In economic terms, anyone with a bushel of wheat during that time could exchange it for a barrel of oil in the world market,'' he said. In 1950, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, wheat was $ 1.91 a bushel and oil at $ 1.71 a barrel, meaning that a bushel of wheat could be traded for 1.1 barrels of oil. In 1972, just a year before the first oil price hike, a bushel of wheat and a barrel of oil were both worth exactly $ 1.91. According to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s report, the world price of wheat in 1975 averaged $ 4.06 per bushel and oil $ 10.72 per barrel, meaning that it took 2.6 bushels of wheat to buy a barrel of oil. `` By 1979, the year of the second oil price hike, the strength of oil had pushed the exchange rate to roughtly 7-to-1,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` This steep rise in grain-purchasing power oil led to one of the greatest international transfers of wealth ever recorded.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> added: `` The coffers of major oil exporters such as <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> began to overflow with dollars as those of many oil-importing countries were being emptied.'' By 1985, oil had edged to more than $ 30 a barrel. With the world price of wheat at $ 3.70 per bushel, it took 8.1 bushels to buy a barrel of oil. `` In 15 years, the terms of trade for oil-exporting countries that import wheat had improved eightfold,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` For countries that export grain to pay for oil, it was an impoverishing 15 years.'' Oil prices dropped by more than half from 1985 to 1986 to $ 14.60 per barrel, reducing the exchange rate to 6-to-1 in 1987, even during a time of weakening grain prices. This year, he said, the world price of wheat may average about $ 3.85 per bushel and oil around $ 16.50 per barrel, or 4.3 bushels of wheat to equal a barrel of oil. `` During the early'70s, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain exports easily paid the nation's oil import bill,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' failure to wean itself from heavy dependence on this increasingly costly commodity contributed to soaring outlays for imports, a widening trade deficit, and mounting external debt.

 This will be an easy quiz. Two television newscasts, both inspired by newspapers, make their debut Monday. One show is based on <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, the other on the Christian Science Monitor. One show will cover international politics, the other will decide how we really feel about our bodies. Made the match? Even before they hit the air, it's obvious that `` World Monitor TV'' and `` USA Today: The Television Show'' will take dramatically different approaches to television news. _ Like the paper from which it springs, `` USA Today: The Television Show'' will be divided into four segments: news, money, sports and life. Each block will have its own anchor, and the emphasis throughout will be decidedly soft. _ Although the news philosophy of `` World Monitor TV'' is clearly more traditional, it looks to be the more problematic show. In an age where `` Entertainment Tonight'' succeeds as journalism and TV Guide is among the most-read magazines, straightforward reporting has come to be something of a gamble. Still, the makers of `` World Monitor TV'' are hopeful. Audiences, the show's creators suspect, may need a hard-news fix. `` People now who are addicted to information feel uninformed,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reporter who will serve as `` World Monitor TV's'' anchor. `` I want to know what's true about things. And I think most people do, too. If you leave people with a sense that the world is made up of unrelated fragments, I think you miss something. It's unbalanced.'' `` World Monitor TV'' will be broadcast weeknights at 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. -LRB- PDT -RRB- on cable television's all-documentary Discovery Channel, the fastest-growing cable network, with 32 million subscriber homes. `` I think the Discovery Channel's audience is very compatible with the kind of news program we want to produce,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, executive producer of `` World Monitor TV.'' The half-hour newscast, produced near the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, will focus on only three or four stories each night and may remind viewers of public TV's MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, which uses a similar format The program will not, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, make any effort to declare, `` That's the way it is.'' `` We have the luxury of not pretending to be a broadcast of record,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. `` We're not going to chase every wisp of smoke. ... We are in the context business. That's our job. We can tell you what the news means. We can make connections, relate history. We can do the things you ca n't do when you're trying to hit all the bases. `` We'll use reporters and foreign correspondents who know the language and know the culture.'' While `` World Monitor TV'' will not be a video version of its newspaper cousin, the newscast will be supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION>'s 22 international and domestic news bureaus. Each broadcast will also include satellite-fed contributions from `` World Monitor TV's'' news desks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hodding </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> will be the program's regular commentator. Do n't look for `` World Monitor TV'' to break news stories on a daily basis. That's not part of the plan, and the newscast does n't have the resources to support an investigative unit `` We might do a story on day care,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` And what we would do is look at the issue in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the Far East and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And then we would make comparisons. We're going to try to do things in depth.'' It is such thoroughness that drew <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, a 28-year network news veteran, to `` World Monitor TV.'' `` At the networks, the commercial considerations are first,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, a Peabody Award-winning reporter, has also served as host of `` NBC Saturday Night News'' and `` NBC Sunday Night News.'' `` This place is a relief,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> continued. `` Here, we wo n't make editorial decisions solely to garner an audience ... These people are interested in journalism. And that's it. They're not caught in the struggle between journalism and marketing. There's nothing wrong with marketing, but it pulls in the opposite direction _ toward fantasy, and not toward reality ... Here's a show where we can deal with ideas for a change.'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> calls `` World Monitor TV'' a `` modest proposal.'' He's right While `` USA Today: The Television Show'' has first-year start-up costs of $ 40 million and a staff of 160, `` World Monitor TV'' has been given $ 20 million for each of its first five years and has just more than 100 employees. Network news budgets, for contrast, averaged $ 275 million last year. `` USA Today: The Television Show,'' meanwhile, is banking that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> viewers want `` entertaining information,'' as the newscast is characterized by its producer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, formerly of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>'s show will be broadcast through syndication, appearing on more than 150 stations across the country. `` USA Today: The Television Show'' and `` World Monitor TV'' do have one thing in common: Neither will try to be a headline service. Each will try to complement, not compete with, the network newscasts. After that, however, all similarities between the two shows end. Thus, if you see `` World Monitor'' looking at the developing black middle class in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, expect `` USA Today: The Television Show'' to explain how men's and women's opinions of love differ. Which show will be a hit? That's hard to say. <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper, has 5.4 million readers. The Christian Science Monitor's circulation, on the other hand, is less than 200,000 Sometimes, though, good things come in small packages.

But traders said there was a great deal of skepticism surrounding his efforts. `` People are becoming jaded because you ca n't get any kind of a good move in crude on the upside,'' said <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>, a senior trader at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> benchmark price for crude is $ 18 a barrel. Traders said the market ignored a report by The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected oil industry newsletter published in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, which stated that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s August output totaled about 20 million barrels a day, roughly 3.5 million barrels a day over its overall production quota.

 <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>, two long-time friends known as brilliant businessmen and ambitious dealmakers, have forged a high-stakes alliance affecting both of their companies and both of their futures. <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON>, the former wildly successful money manager who now is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and current chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $ 1.65 billion. The merger could create financial services company and help <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>, which has had problems with its 1987 acquisition of the struggling brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. It also presents a challenge to <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>, who has a reputation for going into tough situations and turning them around. What is unclear is what role <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> will play in the new company. <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> will be the new company's largest individual shareholder, with about 1.5 percent of its stock, as well as a director and chairman of the board's executive committee. <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> will be chairman, chief executive officer and president of the combined company. Both men shrugged off the role issue in a telephone interview on Monday. When asked who will run the show, <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> said, `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> -RRB- does ... I feel fine about that.'' `` They are a terrific team. This is going to be an absolute powerhouse company,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Califano </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of health, education and welfare. <PERSON> Califano </PERSON> said it was clear that <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> would run the company, even though <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> was n't stepping back. `` <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> is only beginning his career,'' <PERSON> Califano </PERSON> said. `` He's a man with 1,000 ideas.'' Some analysts unsure of <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON>'s role in the new company. `` One conclusion is that Commercial Credit will be the owner _ <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> knows the brokerage business and financial services _ and he will be the one to run the show,'' said <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Heer </PERSON>, an analyst with the brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Tsai is a dealmaker,'' <PERSON> Heer </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know if he has mellowed out or what. In the investment business there is no retirement restriction ... and he is a very vibrant individual.'' <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON>, 59, who has been chairman of Greenwich-based <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> for just 19 months, has surprised people before. He earned a reputation as an investment wizard with some of his stock plays in the 1960s. He became involved with <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> _ then called <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Can </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ in 1982 when he sold it <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION>, which he had acquired earlier. <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> became vice chairman in 1983 and was named chairman in January 1987, helping shepherd the company through transformation from a manufacturing operation to a financial services concern. Under <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON>'s direction, <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> embarked on a strategy of simplifying its operations and strengthening its financial position. <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> said he hoped to spend a lot of time on long-range planning and working with <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> is somebody I have known for well over 25 years. He is a terrific business manager. I'm very excited about this and I think the stockholders will be very happy down the road,'' <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>, 55, a founder of what now is the giant investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also talked about his friendship with <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON>. `` I think we have always gotten along well. I do n't think we'll have any problems,'' <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> said <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> also is not worried about the problems at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> acquired last year for $ 750 million. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> attributed its flat second-quarter earnings to the weak performance by <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, which suffered from lower trading volume, underwriting and commission revenues in the wake of the stock market crash. `` I think there is a really excellent opportunity for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> to grow and prosper even in difficult economic environments,'' <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> said. He and <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> also denied that <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> would be sold; <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> said the firm was an `` important ingredient'' of <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce-Batten </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Legg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, also said he did not believe <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> would be sold. `` He has built a reputation as a strong manager who is able to turn companies around,'' <PERSON> Pearce-Batten </PERSON> said. `` Commercial Credit appears to be in the early stages of another success and <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> is the next quantum leap forward.'' `` ... <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> has a good eye for a bargain, very strong management capabilities, streamling organizations and making them more efficent and at the same time reducing expenses,'' <PERSON> Pearce-Batten </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 after failing to become chief executive officer. He gained control of Baltimore-based Commercial Credit two years ago and last November was edged out by his former firm, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, in an attempt to buy <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Under terms of an agreement approved by both companies' boards, <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would receive one share of Commercial Credit common stock plus $ 7 cash for each share of <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>. Commercial Credit's stock fell 75 cents a share to close at $ 24.50 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> lost 62 -LCB- cents a share to close at $ 29.50 on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Coming Election Will Determine Fate Of U.S. Free Trade Deal</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> has signaled the likelihood of a fall election to decide the fate of both the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and his Progressive Conservative government. In a heated three-way race, the landmark vote on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s economic future would offer the nation a clear choice between conservatives, liberals and socialists <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said in a Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> interview Sunday night, after keeping the country guessing for weeks, that he saw no reason to remain in office much longer than the traditional four years without a new election. Those four years end on Sept. 17. `` I've always believed that while the Constitution allows for a five-year term, that the custom of going about four years _ give or take a couple of months _ is a sound one, and it's one that should be respected,'' he said. An election call Sept. 17 would mean a mid-November election. Canadian campaigns normally last about eight weeks. If <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> wins, the world's two largest trading partners will proceed with plans to create a North American free trade zone on Jan. 1, eliminating all tariffs over 10 years and dismantling barriers to investment and competition. If he loses, both the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> say they will tear up the complex trade deal hailed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as `` only a beginning'' in a global free flow of trade. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, 49, a former corporate lawyer who became leader of his party in 1983 and scored a landslide victory a year later, has been waiting for good omens before calling an election. But Liberal leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> forced <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s hand by asking the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> majority in the unelected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to stall free-trade legislation indefinitely. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> claim the deal jeopardizes Canadian sovereignty. `` We have put in potential jeopardy our cultural programs and our social programs and our ability to assist our less developed regions,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. The elected <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> began its final debate on the trade deal Monday. With Conservatives holding 207 of the 282 seats, the bill should pass easily on Wednesday. The Liberals have 38 seats, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 32, with 2 Independents, 1 Liberal-Independent and 2 vacancies. The deal must then be passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before becoming law. The government hopes that pressure from pro-free traders such as <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s Liberal Premier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> and the western provinces will soften the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s stand, especially amid calls for reform or abolition of the chamber. All players will be watching the Sept. 6 provincial election in <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> to see if Conservative Premier <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> wins another term. `` A Conservative loss could be the one event that could force plans for an election to be put on hold,'' said pollster <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>. A national <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> poll last Friday gave the Conservatives 36 percent of the vote, <ORGANIZATION> Liberals </ORGANIZATION> 32 percent and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 30 percent. The latest Gallup Poll showed the Liberals with 35 percent, Conservatives 34 percent and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 30 percent. Small parties and independents took up the remainder. Such a tight race could result in a minority Conservative government lacking the votes to pass free trade. Historians compare the contest to the milestone election of 1911 when <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> Prime Minister Sir <PERSON> Wilfrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurier </PERSON> offered free trade but lost to Conservative <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Borden </PERSON> who pledged `` No truck nor trade with the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>.'' Despite presiding over a healthy economy and negotiating an accord to bring <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> back into the Constitution, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> has struggled with a credibility problem referred to in the press as the `` sleaze factor.'' He lost eight Cabinet members in scandals ranging from tainted tuna to criminal charges. Liberals gloated this month when a disgruntled former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Blais-Grenier </PERSON>, alleged the <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> government was operating `` a network of patronage and kickbacks.'' She gave no proof but the controversy swelled when two other Quebec Conservatives spoke of `` crumbs'' from the procurement table and information `` that could put a dozen people in jail,'' again without hard evidence. The other parties have their problems, too. Polls show Turner the most unpopular party leader, with only 15 percent voter approval. He has struggled for two years to even hold onto his job in a divided party and is embarrassed by <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>'s close links with <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, whose government has pumped money into <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> Nearly two-thirds of voters say they like <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON>, a former university teacher who claims to speak for `` ordinary Canadians.'' But his popularity may not translate into support for a left-wing party that has never governed <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and is committed to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> withdrawal and protectionism.

<HEAD>Analysis Of Five Pesticides Chavez Wants Banned</HEAD>

 One of the five pesticides the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union wants banned from table grapes is already outlawed and the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is keeping a wary eye on three others. But state officials say the fifth chemical on the list is safe on crops, although it has killed people when used to fumigate houses. The thrust of the union's message during leader <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>'s 36-day fast centered on alleged dangers the five pesticides pose for table grape workers, including risks of cancer, but the union also contends they threaten consumers and the environment <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> was reported Monday recuperating with no sign of long-term ill effects from the fast he ended Aug. 21. Other activists have continued the fast for three days at a time; the latest was actor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>. Union board member <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> claimed some grocers removed table grapes from their shelves as word of the fast spread, but several growers and chain grocers said the fast had no noticeable effect on overall sales of the crop. `` The chemicals he -LRB- <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> -RRB- is talking about on that list are not very valid in terms of farm worker hazards,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, chief of pesticide enforcement for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. The chemicals are <PERSON> Dinoseb </PERSON>, a weed killer; Captan, used to control mold and fungus; methyl bromide, used to kill soil insects and worms; and <PERSON> Phosdrin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Parathion </PERSON>, both used to kill insects. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> banned <PERSON> Dinoseb </PERSON> in 1986 because it has caused birth defects, sterility and other disorders in test animals. The union started its campaign against the chemicals before the state action and never removed Dinoseb from its list. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has Captan, <LOCATION> Posdrin </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Parathion </ORGANIZATION> under special review because of possible danger. Captan has been banned in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has greatly restricted residue levels allowed on imported produce, said Dr. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddy </PERSON>, chief state Food and Agriculture toxicologist. <PERSON> Parathion </PERSON> has been banned `` in a number of countries,'' including <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But methyl bromide seems to be a different story. <ORGANIZATION> UFW </ORGANIZATION> consultant Dr. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> told a reporter that `` there have been more worker deaths, occupational deaths, related to methyl bromide than any other single pesticide.'' But <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said all methyl bromide deaths he was aware of involved people entering houses under fumigation. He said there have been no farm worker or applicator deaths, and grape pickers do not come in contact with methyl bromide because it's used to fumigate soil before grapevines are planted. `` A small amount can cause lung, liver or kidney damage, or it can kill you if you get a strong enough whiff of it,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Heier </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. More than 10 million pounds of the pesticide were used in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1986, but over half was used to fumigate buildings, according to state records. There are concerns about Captan, a fungicide under special review by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> since 1980. It does n't cause immediate sickness but is being studied as a long-term threat, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. `` It causes tumors in animals, and we have proposed to ban all uses because of dietary exposure,'' said <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. Captan residue has been found on 32 of 344 samples of produce tested for that pesticide by the state Food and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The residues were well below federal tolerance levels designed to protect consumers, but the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> claims any Captan residue is a potential threat because it is carcinogenic. <PERSON> Maddy </PERSON>, the state toxicologist, said federal tests give animals such high doses of pesticides that most chemicals show a positive cancer response. Banning Captan could allow certain fungi to thrive on produce, which in turn could be toxic or cancer-causing to consumers, <PERSON> Maddy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Maddy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Phosdrin </PERSON> is under special <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> review for its acute toxicity, or potential to rapidly cause sickness. `` We have very little chronic -LRB- health effects -RRB- data on Phosdrin,'' said <PERSON> Heier </PERSON>. The state reported 273,874 pounds of <LOCATION> Phosdrin </LOCATION>, also known as Mevinphos, were used in 1986. He said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has Parathion under special review because of `` possible nerve damage and eye damage to test animals.'' <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Magee </PERSON>, a Food and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said that to his knowledge no farm workers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have died because of pesticides, a statement the union strongly disputes. State records show that from 1982 to 1986, there were 90 cases of systemic or internal poisonings from all uses of Parathion, 58 Phosdrin cases and 32 methyl bromide cases. During the same period, grape pickers suffered 36 cases of topical poisonings, such as a rash, from Captan when used with other chemicals.

<TEXT>
 Share prices were sharply lower at midday Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, as participants returned from a three-day holiday weekend with unabated worries about the British trade deficit and interest rates. Trading was light, as institutional players awaited further signals on the British economy, dealers said. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 21.0 points, or 3.7 percent, at 1749.7 at 12:30 p.m. local time. The index opened just 4.6 points lower and plunged to a low of 1745.2, or 25.5 points down, at late morning. `` One is watching the market quite carefully,'' said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiorns </PERSON>, a stock analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grieveson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` Fund managers in -LRB- <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> -RRB- still have n't taken any strategic decisions yet.'' Triggering the worries were last week's British trade figures, which showed a record deficit of 2 billion pounds, or about $ 3.6 billion, on the current account in July. A subsequent increase in banks' base lending rates to 12 percent from 11 percent left the market speculating that further rate hikes might be necessary to cool <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s consumer spending boom.

<TEXT>
 The government said today its chief forecasting gauge of future economic activity dropped 0.8 percent in July, the sharpest decline in eight months. Economists said the drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Index of Leading Economic Indicators may be a signal of a pause in what has been booming economic growth this year. But they cautioned against reading too much into a single month's figures. The July decline was the biggest since last November, when the index dropped 1.0 percent in the wake of the October stock market crash. The latest drop was likely to be seen as good news by the stock and bond markets, which have faltered in recent weeks on fears that inflation is heating up. But the dip follows a 1.4 percent jump in the index in June, the biggest increase in 18 months. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> revised its estimate for May, calculating now that the indicators were off by 0.7 percent instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent. The government said last week that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the April-June quarter, following a 3.4 percent expansion pace in the first three months of the year. This strong growth has raised concern at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which is charged with keeping inflation under control. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been pusing up short-term interest rates since late March in an attempt to slow growth to a sustainable, non-inflationary pace. On Aug. 9, it took its most dramatic inflation-fighting move by raising the discount rate, its key bank lending rate, by a half percentage point. Since then, analysts have been watching government economic statistics closely for indications of whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has tigtened enough. In July, the weakness in the leading indicators was widespread, with seven of the available nine components registering declines. The biggest drain came from an 11.3 percent jump in unemployment claims. That was followed in order of severity by a drop in new orders for consumer goods; a decline in building permits; a speedup in business deliveries, considered a sign of slackening demand; a drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 500 stocks, a contraction of the money supply and a drop in plant and equipment orders. One indicator, a rise in prices for raw materials, was read as a sign of economic strength. The length of the average workweek was unchanged in July. The 0.8 percent overall decline left the index at 192.1 percent of its 1967 base of 100.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a private economic forecaster in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he expected GNP growth likely will slow to an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the second half, closer to what the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> considers sustainable without quickening inflaton. He said growth in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports and increases in investment spending by businesses likely would slow from the torrid pace earlier this year. Also, higher interest rates are already beginning to pinch the housing industry. However, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the momentum of the economy will keep growth strong until at least the second half of next year. `` I really think we'll see just a temporary slowing. My own feeling is economic growth in the second half will continue at about the same pace as the first half,'' he said. `` My own guess is that there will have to be some more <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening and still higher interest rates. But most of that upward pressure will come after the election and we'll see a pause for a while,'' he said. Economists cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from the leading index until a clear pattern emerges over three months. Since it was created in 1948, the index has fallen three months in a row a total of 12 times. In eight of those instances, a recession followed. The other four times, economic growth slowed, but there was no recession. The index last declined three consecutive months from June through August in 1984. There was no recession, but the economy did enter a two-year period of slow growth. Also, initial estimates of the index are frequently revised substantially in later months. For instance, within the last year, there were preliminary reports of declines for five consecutive months _ from September through January. However, later revisions wiped out all but two of those drops, in November and January.

The company will use a variety of advertising messages, she said. One of them will tout the new product as `` Premier _ the Cleaner Smoke.'' But the company is not making any health or safety claims. `` We're not claiming this is a safe or safer cigarette,'' she said. Company officials say the new cigarettes contain a high-tech packet of tobacco extracts, which is heated, but not burned. The result is a cigarette without odor and only a trace of ash or environmental smoke that could irritate people nearby.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has filed suit against <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in its $ 500 million hostile bid for the New Haven-based auto parts maker. The suit, filed Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION>, charges that <PERSON> Armtek </PERSON>'s board misued a variety of anti-takeover measures in order to prevent its shareholders from determining whether they want to accept <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>'s $ 44-a-share cash tender offer. Mark IV has asked the court to order Armtek not to implement anti-takeover measures. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sievers </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION> vice president of coporate planning and investor relations, declined comment. In a lawsuit filed earlier this month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> federal court, Armtek accused <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, a holding company based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, of violating disclosure requirments of federal securities laws. The suit seeks injunctions barring Mark IV from purchasing Armtek stock or seeking control of the company. According to a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing, <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION> has set Sept. 1 as the date by which it will exercise its `` poison pill'' or shareholders' rights agreement. Under the plan, the company would distribute a new series of preferred stock. The new stock can be converted into cash at a premium rate, raising the cost of an acquisition in an effort to deter hostile bidders. Formerly the <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Armtek </PERSON> makes plastics and specialty chemicals used in the automotive and other industries.

<HEAD>Leading Indicators, Factory Orders Down Sharply in July</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said today its chief forecasting gauge of future economic activity dropped 0.8 percent in July, the sharpest decline in eight months, while orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories fell a steep 3.5 percent. Economists said the drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Index of Leading Economic Indicators may be a signal of a pause in what has been booming economic growth this year. But they cautioned against reading too much into a single month's figures. The July decline was the biggest since last November, when the index dropped 1.0 percent in the wake of the October stock market crash. Orders for manufactured goods, which registered their steepest decrease in 18 months, were dragged down by a sharp decline in military orders, the department said. Orders for both durable and non-durable goods fell $ 7.9 billion last month to $ 220.2 billion. But the decline, the worst since a 3.6 percent drop in January 1987, had been anticipated. In a revision of the previous month's figure, the government said orders rose 5.4 percent in June, the largest monthly increase in more than 17 years. Both the stock and bond markets reacted cooly to the latest hints that the economy may be slowing. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s long bond was little changed, while trading was mixed on Wall Street. Separately, a government report released Monday showed a big drop in new-home sales last month in the face of higher mortgage rates. The departments of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said sales of new single-family homes fell 4.7 percent in July to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 686,000 units. It was the biggest decline since a 6.2 percent decline in December. The government also reduced estimates for June and May, showing less housing strength than previously believed. Fixed-rate mortgages have risen by almost a point since March to their highest levels of the year, boosting the monthly payment on a new $ 100,000 mortgage by about $ 65. But the housing report was well received by traders in the bond market, which has been languishing because of fears of inflation and higher interest rates. Bond prices posted the biggest gain in nearly four weeks, although trading was light. Brokers said lower commodity prices and a higher-valued dollar also played roles in the rally. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year bond climbed nearly $ 10 per $ 1,000 face amount, its biggest one-day gain since Aug. 2. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 9.33 percent from 9.43 percent late Friday. The bond rally also helped Wall Street, which has been sensitive to rising interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had bounced around last week to post a net gain of 1.43 points, rose 24.00 to 2,041.43.

 Multimillionaire commodities trader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, a legend whose luck turned sour after last October's stock market collapse, says he is leaving the futures business to concentrate on his other passion: politics. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, 39, known as the `` Prince of the Pit'' at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s boisterous commodities exchanges, said Monday he was closing his accounts and selling his exchange seats so he could devote his energies to `` public policy and political endeavors. `` There is only so much satisfaction and utility to the making of money,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. He said he would use his personal fortune, reportedly around $ 200 million, as a launching pad for his new career. `` I am fortunate to have enough assets and opportunities to try to make a significant impact on our political lives. As I approach 40 years of age, I believe it is time for me to take on this new set of challenges,'' the statement read. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said he would concentrate on writing, speaking and `` active involvement with voters and candidates.'' He was national co-chairman for the unsuccessful Democratic presidential campaign of former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>. He also has made sizable contributions to several other Democratic campaigns since 1980, including the 1984 presidential bid of former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and the 1986 <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> gubernatorial campaign of <PERSON> Adlai </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said he now supports the presidential bid of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and has contributed $ 100,000 to his campaign. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> believes <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> could have a large and lasting impact on the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` ` His primary concern is the power of ideas,'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said. `` He wants to force the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to rethink its agenda. He has a passion for economic reform.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> also donated $ 10 million to establish the <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal think-tank with offices in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and is a leading financial backer of People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal group formed as a counterpoint to the conservative Moral Majority. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, began his financial career at age 17 as a $ 1.60-an-hour brokerage house runner at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. After graduating from <ORGANIZATION> DePaul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> with a degree in philosophy, he bought his first exchange seat _ on the tiny <ORGANIZATION> MidAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> _ at age 21. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> owns seats on every major commodity exchange and runs two companies: C & amp; <ORGANIZATION> D </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION>, a futures trading partnership of which he is managing partner, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an advising firm for managed futures funds and accounts. His uncanny success as a trader earned him the nickname `` Prince of the Pit'' on the floors of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. But his fortune seemed to sour after last October's markets collapse, in which C & amp; <ORGANIZATION> D </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> reportedly lost $ 10 million. Two public commodity funds <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> launched last year in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> also fell on hard times. After they lost more than 50 percent of their $ 115 million combined initial value, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> suspended trading last April in the funds. Both funds resumed trading on Aug. 3 following a vote of confidence by investors, and each had lost about 3.5 percent when trading was halted for good on Friday, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Dennis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokeman. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> blamed the losses on `` choppy markets _ the worst markets we've seen in 10 years.'' He said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>' decision to quit trading was not related to the funds' losses. Several veteran traders on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>' exit from the futures business had been expected. `` I know that for the last several years, his main interest in life has been politics, not trading,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` He is certainly one of biggest, most successful traders ever,'' <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. `` Over the past year he supposedly had some rough times but overall he made a lot of money and was very, very succesful.'' `` I personally was surprised he stayed around so long,'' added <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of CBOT floor operations for <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` With the fact that he's made so much money, I could n't understand why he'd want to keep risking capital,'' <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON> said `` As one guy said to me this morning, he's made more money than he could spend in 10 lifetimes.''

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A new smokeless cigarette developed by <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will be test-marketed in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, beginning Oct. 1, company officials said today. The new cigarettes, called Premier, will be odorless and will generate only a trace of ash or smoke that could irritate people nearby, the officials said. Company officials said the new cigarettes contain a high-tech packet of tobacco extracts which is heated, but not burned. The price per pack will be about 30 cents higher than other cigarettes, said <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Annese </PERSON>, director of public relations for the Winston-Salem-based company. The company will use a variety of advertising messages to sell the new cigarettes, she said; one advertising approach will tout the new product as `` Premier _ the Cleaner Smoke.'' But the company is not making any health or safety claims. `` We're not claiming this is a safe or safer cigarette,'' she said. A health claim would invite regulation by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` If a product is sold with claims to make cigarettes safer, it is a medical device'' subject to <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Anti-smoking groups are pressing the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to regulate the new cigarettes as a drug because, they maintain, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> is making implied health claims for its product. In addition, the anti-smoking groups say the new cigarettes could appeal to teen-agers, thereby gaining a new generation of smokers as customers. Analysts said <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> selected the test markets, in particular the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> cities, because they have numerous older, sophisticated smokers who may be trying to quit smoking or are seeking an alternative.

<HEAD>Report Congress Probing 30 Firms in Swiss Insider Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional investigators have uncovered evidence suggesting that up to 30 Wall Street firms unwittingly participated in an insider trading scheme conducted via a Swiss brokerage, an industry publication says. The Aug. 29 edition of Investment Dealers' Digest says the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>'s oversight and investigations subcommittee will hold a hearing Sept. 8 and reveal the findings, which indicate the Wall Street firms failed to detect suspicious trades coming from the <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> A.G. brokerage. The weekly publication said the questionable trades covered as many as 100 takeover deals from 1982 to 1985. Under Swiss bank secrecy laws, trades executed by a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> banking firm through other entities, such as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment firms, do n't have to be identified. This means someone holding an account through a Swiss firm can trade through the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets without fear of detection. The Investment Dealers Digest quoted unidentified congressional aides as saying that in some cases, large trades from <PERSON> A.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> were spread out over a range of Wall Street firms in order to make the transactions less obvious. It said the repeated pattern of stock trades up to and during a takeover attempt, however, prompted congressional suspicion of insider trading, the misuse of confidential information, such as impending takeovers, to profit in the securities markets. The subcommittee has been looking for evidence that the surveillance systems of Wall Street firms are inadequate, which some lawmakers say justify legislation that would increase firm liability in insider trading cases. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> has been the focus of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Swiss law enforcement investigations for months, though no action has been brought so far and the sources behind the questionable trades have n't been determined. The congressional probe was prompted partly by testimony from convicted insider trader <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, who traded through <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leu </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> bank, as a way to hide his activities.

 Grain and soybean futures opened slightly higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a continuation of Monday's late surge, analysts said Further support stemmed from a slight pickup in export business but analysts expected the grain markets to remain in a pre-harvest lull. The corn and soybean crops are past their most critical growth stages and maturing rapidly, said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, an assistant vice president in the grain futures trading division of <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Nothing really can happen to the crops at this point unless we have a frost immediately,'' she said. `` Typically, it's pretty quiet before the harvest.'' The Midwestern corn harvest has just begun and will get into full swing in another two to three weeks, while soybean harvesting will peak near the end of September, she said. In early trading, wheat was -RCB- cent to 3 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.88 -LCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to 2 cents higher with September at $ 2.74 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 3 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.52 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with September at $ 8.28 a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .03 cent to .55 cent lower with October at 72.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent to .70 cent lower with September at 81.90 cents a pound; hogs were .70 cent lower to .07 cent higher with October at 39.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .55 cent to 1.67 cents lower with February at 51.15 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled mixed on Monday while pork futures were sharply lower.

 <ORGANIZATION> Rawson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its owner have been awarded $ 23.6 million in damages in a civil suit accusing <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of issuing bad advice on <PERSON> Rawson </PERSON>'s 1985 purchase of part of the Pantry Pride supermaket chain A <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury of five women and one man deliberated for three hours Monday before awarding owner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> $ 2 million in compensatory and punitive damages and the company $ 21.6 million. The lawsuit alleged that Prudential-Bache had recklessly advised <PERSON> Rawson </PERSON> and his company to buy 43 <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> stores from <ORGANIZATION> Pantry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pride </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 40 million. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> charged $ 1 million for its services. The lawsuit said the real value of the stores was much less than what <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> claimed it was. <ORGANIZATION> Rawson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code in February 1986. The 45-store chain claimed assets of $ 44.6 million and liabilities of $ 51 million. `` We are obviously very pleased with the verdict because it means the remaining creditors of the estate can be repaid,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>, an attorney representing <PERSON> Raswon </PERSON>. The day it filed for reorganization, <PERSON> Rawson </PERSON> agreed to sell 33 of its Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Super </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> for $ 31.2 million. Super Valu then sold the stores to <ORGANIZATION> Winn-Dixie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The remaining stores were sold to other companies but it left <PERSON> Rawson </PERSON> $ 15 million too short to pay off its creditors. Prudential-Bache had argued it was not liable for damages because its advise was based largely on information from <PERSON> Rawson </PERSON>'s management team Attorney <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> <PERSON> Hair </PERSON>, who represented Prudential-Bache, was out of the office Tuesday and was unavailable for comment.

<HEAD>TWA Flight Attendants Ask DOT to Investigate Icahn's Fitness</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The flight attendants union at <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> charged today that <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s future and the safety of the flying public are jeopardized by financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s proposal to take the airline private. The flight attendants asked the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> to investigate <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s fitness to continue operating <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> is being managed today not as an air carrier but as an unsupervised mutual fund benefiting Mr. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankovich </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. The IFFA represents about 9,000 flight attendants at <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. The union charged that since <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> took control of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> two years ago, he has `` milked'' the airline's cash reserves and sold off assets to finance his stock market and takeover ventures, instead of buying new airplanes and safety equipment for the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> fleet. The airline's fleet is one of the oldest in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry, with planes averaging 13.3 years old. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> plans to spend just over 1 percent of its budget this year on new planes, while most other major airlines usually invest about 15 percent or 20 percent in new equipment, according to union lawyer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronofsky </PERSON>. This, the union says, contributes to high maintenance costs and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s accident and incident rate, which according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is the worst among major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is asking <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> shareholders at a meeting Sept. 7 to sell their stock to him. The purchase would be financed by the sale of speculative, high-yield bonds, which the union says would raise <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual interest payments to $ 466 million, almost double the airline's 1987 operating earnings of $ 240 million. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> referred all questions to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, senior vice president for employee relations. He declined immediate comment, saying he had not had time to study the news release. The union also has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> to freeze <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s assets while it investigates <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s management. The <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> machinists union, which also opposes the privatization and filed suit in federal court last week in an effort to stop it, is being asked to join the IFFA petition but has not yet had time to study it, <PERSON> Frankovich </PERSON> said. `` We could n't wait,'' she said, adding that she expects the machinists to join the flight attendants in asking the DOT to stop <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s privatization effort. Unions at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> made a similar request to the DOT last year. In its findings the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> said acrimonious relations between labor and management could lead to operational problems, and a former Secretary of Labor was appointed to act as a mediator.

 <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> rode a rising star through <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, flying through management ranks in an 11-year stint that he ended as the highest-ranking black officer at the dowager of American manufacturing. He resigned Aug. 1 with his star still rising to take over the $ 3 billion truck division at <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with the job of making a good operation better. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 49, is bringing to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s leading maker of medium - and heavy-duty trucks his reputation as `` a very dynamic leader, accepted within all ranks,'' said spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> `` We're happy to have him,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who joined <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> Aug. 8. `` He has a strong background in manufacturing, and certainly with ... people. He has some very strong leadership capabilities and a competitive spirit.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> declined to make <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> available for comment, `` until he gets ... his feet on the ground,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenhill </PERSON>. As he departed, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> got an official blessing from <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> has been a valued executive and an outstanding contributor in every assignment throughout his <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> career,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer. `` We wish him the best in his new position at <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION>.'' With $ 4 billion in annual sales, <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> is enjoying its third straight profitable year, after six money-losers stemming from recession, labor troubles and the farm crisis of the early 1980s. The company's truck division is the leader in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' job will be `` to expand or strengthen that leadership position,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. `` He is not taking over in a ` back' position. <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> plucked <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> from possible contention as <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s first minority chief operating officer, luring him with cash and stock valued at about $ 400,000, plus an annual salary estimated at nearly $ 440,000, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> ackowledged. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who was vice president of personnel administration and development for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, is in charge of engineering, manufacturing and marketing of medium - and heavy-duty trucks for <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION>, formerly International Harvester His record for inspiring loyalty among employees while keeping operations competitive is among his chief assets, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> faced perhaps his greatest challenge at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> when he had to lay off 40,000 white-collar workers, 25 percent of the company's salaried employees `` If anyone thinks it's fun to ask anyone to leave <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, it's not fun. It's not fun,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> recently. It was employee loyalty to <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> that caught the eye of a superior and served as a catalyst to his meteoric rise, according to a recent interview in the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, then a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, said he was inspecting the plant that <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> managed in <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, when <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> introduced him to about 70 employees, the newspaper reported. `` I looked at the faces of the employees as he spoke, and you could tell that they loved him and that they loved working for him,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was quoted as saying. At <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> is credited with saving the plant from shutdown by winning the nod to build <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s plastic-body minivan. `` He's a very inspirational man, full of warmth and humor. I was moved by his abilities,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who remembered <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> a year later when the post of vice president of personnel fell vacant. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> `` is the ideal role model for young people of all races. Not only has he shown steady growth throughout his career, he has evidenced that hard work has its rewards. `` He has further shown that one can be aggressive and committed to civil rights and still succeed in corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said in a recent statement, noting that <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> has maintained an active involvement in the Urban League and <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. At the Urban League's national conference in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> earlier this month, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> gave two talks, including one on the importance of education. `` He's also one of the nicest people you'll ever want to meet,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewart </PERSON>. One of 10 children born to a family in <LOCATION> Magnolia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' mother died when he was 2 and his father moved the family to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> began his career on the factory floor at Grand Rapids auto parts supplier <ORGANIZATION> Lear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siegler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1959 He worked nights so he could go to school and earn a business administration degree while also supporting a family. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> as director of education and training at the diesel equipment division in 1977, took over <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION> in 1985 and became vice president in 1987, skipping half a dozen management levels.

<TEXT>
 A pinhead-sized aphid is giving new meaning to the words `` Russian menace'' as Midwestern farmers scout their fields for the insect. <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> entomologist, says the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> wheat aphid is a crop pest that has been spreading since its discovery in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> around 1900. It was in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1978, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> by the early 1980s and crossed into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in 1985 or 1986. `` It's relatively rare to find a pest that is a completely new pest to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or in this case, the western hemisphere,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> fields first were infested in April 1986. During 1988, at least 49 central and western counties were affected. As of July, the insect had spread almost to the Candian border and had been spotted in 14 states including <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Entomologists estimate the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> wheat aphid has cost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> small grains growers more than $ 100 million in insecticides and lost yields. Figures for the 1988 crop are n't yet available, nor are projections estimating the aphid problems the new crop might face. But in 1987, about 38 percent, or about 4 million acres, of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> wheat crop was affected, <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. Infestation levels were even higher elsewhere. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> officials said all of their small grains crops were infested to varying degrees during 1987. In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, infestation was 64 percent and in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 56 percent. In some cases, the aphids are present in enough numbers to kill plants, he said. Usually, their impact is on yields, turning potentially high yield fields into riskier ventures. The aphid also helps provide shelter for another pest, the greenbug. When Russian heat aphids attack wheat plant leaves, the leaves roll up. Greenbugs like the protection this affords and appear to use it for development, allowing them to attack in higher numbers, he said. Greenbugs and <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> wheat aphids are similar in appearance, <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. The aphids have a more spindle-like body and do n't carry the dark stripe common to greenbugs The aphid also does n't have the visible cornicles, or tailpipes, the greenbug has, he said The first signs of Russian wheat aphid trouble come when plants begin to show a green and white streaked appearance on the upper side of their leaves, <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. Damaged plants have a pink or purple cast to the undersides of their leaves, he said. Driving by a field is n't a good way to survey it for the aphids, nor is just checking the edges only. `` It is only when you get down on your hands and knees a ways into a field and start looking plant by plant and tiller by tiller that you can detect these early signs,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. He recommends checking about 20 consecutive plants and then doing the same at about five other spots in the field. Sometimes, wheat streak mosaic and other diseases or pests may mask the presence of the aphids, he said. Potential yields have to be taken into account when deciding whether to hire an aerial sprayer to apply insecticide for around $ 8 an acre. Volunteer wheat, which often sprouts after a harvest, and natural grasses make good hosts for the pests before they can prey on young planted wheat in early fall and early spring, <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. Volunteer, which also can spread other pests and diseases, should be controlled to help eliminate problems. Some experts are recommending late-fall planting because early-planted wheat and small grains seem to suffer the worst aphid infestations. `` We really do n't have any good documented evidence on just how important that is right now,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. Entomologists fear the aphids could develop a tolerance to some of the insecticides now being used. `` Just a slight increase in tolerance could mean the difference between successful control and not being able to get control at all,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. Insecticide manufacturers are developing new chemicals that can replace those currently used if tolerance becomes a problem. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a study involving the importation of beneficial insects to control the aphid. Insects are being transported from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for the research work.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When he was just barely a teen-ager, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> decided he wanted to add a chapter to the book of retailing. By 1982, armed with an economics degree and experience as a Wall Street analyst and department store executive, he was ready to start writing. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, then 31, opened his first Bookstop store in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> capital, modeling it loosely on the successful Toys R Us design _ big selection and discount prices. A book `` superstore,'' he called it. Six years later, the Bookstop chain has grown to 17 stores _ with three more scheduled to open by year's end _ in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. And the Bookstop founder and chairman says confidently that there will be more to the story. `` I decided when I was, like 13 years old, that someday I was going to start a chain of stores. Everything I've done since then was toward that goal,'' he said. But if your idea of a bookstore is a small, musty, dark-paneled place awash in pipe smoke, Bookstop stores might come as a shock. The company says its average store covers 9,500 square feet and stocks 35,000 titles in 300 subject areas. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> is an architecture buff, and the stores have moved into some unusual sites, including <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s art-deco <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> movie theater. The store being opened in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> will be located in a 100-year-old cotton warehouse. `` We've got the flexibility to do those things _ old cafeterias, old roller-skating rinks, old theaters,'' he said. `` I'd love to be in an old bank, too.'' Bookstops are open 12 hours a day or more, some closing only two days a year. They offer discounts of 10 percent on most titles, 25 percent on bestsellers and up to 40 percent for customers who annually purchase `` Readers Choice'' cards. The company counts more than 200,000 cardholders. Bookstop has centralized distribution, so books arriving at the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> headquarters from publishers can be inventoried, labeled with the chain's own price tags and shipped to stores. The stores transmit their sales results nightly by computer, making them available the next morning so Bookstop's four buyers can see what's selling `` With a superstore like ours, to break even, our annual sales volume's got to be three, four times the sales of the average bookstore. It's a much harder thing to do, to carry that big a selection. We need an advanced computer system, real sophisticated inventory control systems, and yet we try to do it all at a discount,'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Bookstop </PERSON> moved 4.5 million volumes through its distribution center last year. `` Retailing's always been an intensely competitive business. But it's becoming a much more technological business. Our survival depends much more on research, on understanding the customer, on computerized controls,'' he said. The privately held company does n't make public sales figures, although <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> has said in the past that 1986 sales were $ 26 million. In 1985, the chain grew from six stores to 12 in 105 days. The company's founder got his start with an economics degree from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. He was a retailing analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and worked for department store companies in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. He says he spent seven years working on his Bookstop business plan before raising the money to open the first store. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> readily credits the Toys R Us stores with the concept. He voices a strong belief that discount specialty stores will be among retailing's big winners between now and the end of the century. He cites such companies as <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emporium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, Sound Warehouse, and new superstores in office supplies and sporting goods. `` Books is one of the fastest-growing categories of retailing ... That demand ties to the baby boom, because baby boomers are getting richer every day, their incomes are rising as a group, and they're really oriented toward buying books, continuing self-education, and now buying their children books,'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said. Although other bookstore chains already were major national forces, <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said he did n't encounter too much skepticism when he approached investors with his idea of another. `` Books have survived the introduction of radio, the introduction of television, the introduction of phonograph records and movies. Books are a way of transmitting information, and compared with other ways of transmitting information, they are still cheap, portable, compact and readily available. We're trying to do our part to make them more readily available,'' he said.

<HEAD>Southeast Asian Influence Will Increase In World Economy, Think
Tank Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s role in the world economy will expand through the year 2000, while Japanese markets will become more competitive and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> output will decline, a think tank predicted Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION> said in a long-range forecast that <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s Gross National Product, or its total output of goods and services, will rise steadily over the next decade while those of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will shrink. Through the turn of the century, <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s GNP will rise 5.4 points while GNP in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will decline 2.9 and 2.5 points, respectively, the institute predicted. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy will grow at an average inflation-adjusted pace of 4.7 percent through the year 2000, the institute said. `` We have to be aware that the Japanese market will become increasingly competitive,'' the report said. `` This is because imports will continue to rise because of the yen's appreciation. `` The Japanese economy ... will be considered an extremely large market and direct investment by foreign companies will increase,'' it added. The institute said it based its prediction for the economic growth of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> on the recent fast rise in trade among the countries in the region, including the so-called newly industrialized economies like <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> as well as among members of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, including <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. Steady development in the division of industrial production between <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will help avoid serious competition among themselves, the report said. Economic growth of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> has come primarily from the effects of policies set in motion, the report said, but the development of the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> economy has drawn its strength from `` autonomous economic dynamism'' itself. The report forecast that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economic growth will be powered by personal spending and private-sector capital investment. In addition, investment profits will surge in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with the outstanding balance of investments in 2000 reaching $ 1.100 trillion and profits totaling at least $ 80 billion a year, the institute said. A characteristic of the Japanese economy toward the year 2000 will be clearly reflected in the country's international balance of payments, according to the think tank. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus will shrink to $ 600 million from $ 94.3 billion in fiscal 1987 ended last March, almost attaining equilibrium, it said. Exports will increase an average 7.2 percent in each of the years but imports will register an 11.6 percent rise due in part to stronger internal demand for manufactured goods, the institute said. However, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wo n't become a net debtor, according to the institute. The institute said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy has the potential to attain growth exceeding 3 percent a year after inflation is taken into account. `` Already, its trade deficit has been shrinking as a result of economic expansion led by exports,'' it said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit also will dwindle because of high tax revenues, it predicted. By the mid-1990s the so-called `` twin deficts'' will largely disappear, it said.

 Every year a new crop of youngsters enters the world of adult finance, the first requirement of which is access to credit in their own names. This is a credit society, and those who do n't have it _ who, in fact, might disdain it in favor of paying everything in cash _ very often find themselves in perplexing situations. In fact, it has been argued from time to time that credit is a right, since the possibilities of existing or advancing in a credit society are greatly lessened for those who pay in cash or are denied access to the system. Having credit is, in a sense, a person's identity in the marketplace, often being necessary to rent a car or reserve a hotel room. An absolutely credit-free record might be admired in some places, but not in the marketplace. It is odd, therefore, that there is no smooth, formal, recognized, accepted, institutionalized way of entering the world of credit. You must, so to speak, walk through the wall. There is no door; there is n't even a key. At most, there are a few tips, says the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, to wit: _ If you have n't already done so, open a checking account and a savings account at a financial institution You may then use the institution as a credit reference, assuming you keep your checkbook correctly posted. _ After a couple of months, ask that institution for a Visa or <ORGANIZATION> Mastercard </ORGANIZATION> line of credit Some might offer these cards even before you apply. If so, take them, and never miss a payment. _ Investigate `` affinity group'' credit This is credit made available to members of a particular group, including alumni of colleges. Such groups sometimes offer widely accept credit cards. _ Check on the prospect of using your savings account as collateral for a loan Generally, such loans also carry very low interest rates. _ Apply for a local retailer's charge card Small stores tend to judge you at face value rather than through credit history. They want your business. If you obtain credit, pay your bills promptly. You want them as a reference. Even if you're successful in all these possibilities, you still might be forced into having a co-signer for big-ticket items such as an automobiles. Co-signers often are parents. Most of these suggestions are from the institute, a division of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents companies that lend to consumers and small businesses. But such suggestion are only the beginning. That is, once credit is established, it must be built, a process that new credit-users have always sought to speed up. It can be done, although it might cost a small amount of money. The technique, used over the years by many entrepreneurs, is to borrow money and then simply use it and a bit more to repay the loan ahead of the scheduled repayment date. Pre-payment impresses lenders. On the next visit to the lender you make use of your good record. You apply for a somewhat larger amount, and because of your good repayment record you might get it. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, a business executive and author of more than 50 books on grassroots financing, describes a once popular technique in which borrowers obtained three times as much money as their financial situation would suggest. The technique was simple: Knowing they faced a turndown if they applied for $ 15,000, they applied instead for five $ 5,000 loans at five banks in the same day. To the question, `` Do you owe money to any other lender?'' they would answer `` no.'' It was an honest answer, since they really had no big debts outstanding. If the person was lucky, and appeared to be reliable and responsible, perhaps three banks would respond with $ 5,000 each. The trick then was to find an investment that would make the $ 15,000 grow larger. The more conservative of these borrowers would refrain from using the entire $ 15,000, but instead would invest $ 10,000 in an income-producing property and keep $ 5,000 in reserve to service the three loans. It was a desperate procedure, but many real estate investors got started with this or similar techniques. They agree it was dangerous to their financial health, but as they saw it, it was even unhealthier to attempt getting along without sufficient credit in a credit-based society.

<HEAD>Tokyo And Osaka Exchanges To Launch Index Futures Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As part of a wave of liberalization in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s financial markets, the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> stock exchanges are to launch stock index futures trading starting Saturday Exchange officials say the index futures market is likely to exceed the size of the regular stock market within a few years and affect the investment patterns of Japanese institutional investors. They also say it is an ideal opportunity for foreign investment firms, which are more experienced in futures trading than their Japanese counterparts, to penetrate Japanese financial markets. `` We are hoping the new index futures trading will also promote the growth of the equity market as the futures market attracts more money to stock markets,'' said <PERSON> Keiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Okada </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s futures trading department. `` I expect the index futures market will exceed the size of the cash market within a few years.'' Index futures contracts allow speculative investors to bet on the direction of an entire set of stocks rather than putting their money into stocks of individual companies. More cautious investors can use index futures contracts as hedges to offset positions in the stock market. Index futures contracts would also permit various forms of program trading, including index arbitrage, which some critics blame for exacerbating the instability of prices on Wall Street. Both exchanges said they will allow foreign non-member securities firms to participate in index futures trading. `` Foreign securities companies are more experienced in futures trading than their Japanese counterparts,'' said <PERSON> Okada </PERSON>. `` They will have an edge over their Japanese competitors. At the same time, Japanese securities companies can learn from them.'' The inauguration of index futures trading in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been long awaited by investors eager to hedge against possible fluctuations of share prices in the equity markets. While major stock exchanges around the world offer a broad range of financial futures trading, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has offered only 10-year government bond futures. Trading in them began in 1985. As pressure mounts to make the Japanese money market more open and internationalized, Japanese exchanges and the securities industry have been gradually launching new services to keep up with rapidly changing and diversifying demands. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> exchange will use the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> price index, or Topix, an index of all 1,100 shares on the exchange's first section weighted toward the bigger companies, while the <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>'s futures market will be based on the more popular Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a simple average of 225 leading stocks Analysts and exchange officials say TOPIX is a more accurate indicator of overall market trends, but the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index is more responsive to the mood of the market. `` TOPIX is not as vulnerable to the fluctuation of high priced, small-capital shares like the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index is, but <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> is by far the best-known index,'' said <PERSON> Okada </PERSON>. Institutional investors generally welcome the new system, which can protect them from day-to-day price fluctuations in their stocks. But some are concerned that the index futures market may have a negative impact on the equity market. `` When the futures market is on a downturn, most investors will assume the spot market also will be heading downward shortly and withdraw their funds from the spot market,'' said a securities dealer at a major brokerage in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` It will cause a further decline in share prices.''

<HEAD>EPA Sues Chevron, Charging Benzene Leaks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is suing <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, charging cancer-causing benzene is leaking from its refinery in south <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the company announced Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here Monday accusing the gasoline giant of consistently failing over the past four years to monitor and repair the equipment that handles benzene at the refinery. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> operations, said the company was in compliance with <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> regulations. <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> said the company would cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> on any problems that might have occurred. The suit seeks an injunction requiring the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-based </LOCATION> corporation to comply with the federal Clean Air Act. `` Unless enjoined by an order of this court,'' the lawsuit says, `` these violations will continue.'' For each of the 19 alleged violations of the federal law, the suit seeks penalties of up to $ 25,000 a day. Neither the lawsuit nor government spokesmen gave a total dollar amount of possible fines. `` Benzene constitutes a serious health threat when released into the air. ... It is <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> policy to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure compliance with applicable emission standards,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seif </PERSON>, regional <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator, said in a press release announcing the suit. Special Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smolski </PERSON> said it was unclear how much benzene had escaped from the refinery system because of the alleged violations. Different leaks have been occurring since 1984, he said. <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> said that of 338 workers checked for benzene exposure in 1987, 98.3 percent were under <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> limits. He noted that the refinery is about 1 -LCB- miles from any homes.

 The government said today its chief forecasting gauge of future economic activity dropped 0.8 percent in July, the sharpest decline in eight months. Economists said the drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Index of Leading Economic Indicators may be a signal of a pause in what has been booming economic growth this year. But they cautioned against reading too much into a single month's figures. The July decline was the biggest since last November, when the index dropped 1.0 percent in the wake of the October stock market crash. The latest drop was likely to be seen as good news by the stock and bond markets, which have faltered in recent weeks on fears that inflation is heating up. But the dip follows a 1.4 percent jump in the index in June, the biggest increase in 18 months. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> revised its estimate for May, calculating now that the indicators were off by 0.7 percent instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent. White House spokesman <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said, `` The data suggest continued economic growth in the months ahead, although at a more moderate pace than in the first half'' of the year. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, with the vacationing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The government said last week that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the April-June quarter, following a 3.4 percent expansion pace in the first three months of the year. This strong growth has raised concern at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which is charged with keeping inflation under control. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been pusing up short-term interest rates since late March in an attempt to slow growth to a sustainable, non-inflationary pace. On Aug. 9, it took its most dramatic inflation-fighting move by raising the discount rate, its key bank lending rate, by a half percentage point. Since then, analysts have been watching government economic statistics closely for indications of whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has tigtened enough. In July, the weakness in the leading indicators was widespread, with seven of the available nine components registering declines. The biggest drain came from an 11.3 percent jump in unemployment claims. That was followed in order of severity by a drop in new orders for consumer goods; a decline in building permits; a speedup in business deliveries, considered a sign of slackening demand; a drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 500 stocks, a contraction of the money supply and a drop in plant and equipment orders. One indicator, a rise in prices for raw materials, was read as a sign of economic strength. The length of the average workweek was unchanged in July. The 0.8 percent overall decline left the index at 192.1 percent of its 1967 base of 100.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a private economic forecaster in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he expected GNP growth likely will slow to an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the second half, closer to what the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> considers sustainable without quickening inflaton. He said growth in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports and increases in investment spending by businesses likely would slow from the torrid pace earlier this year. Also, higher interest rates are already beginning to pinch the housing industry. However, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the momentum of the economy will keep growth strong until at least the second half of next year. `` I really think we'll see just a temporary slowing. My own feeling is economic growth in the second half will continue at about the same pace as the first half,'' he said. `` My own guess is that there will have to be some more <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening and still higher interest rates. But most of that upward pressure will come after the election and we'll see a pause for a while,'' he said. Economists cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from the leading index until a clear pattern emerges over three months. Since it was created in 1948, the index has fallen three months in a row a total of 12 times. In eight of those instances, a recession followed. The other four times, economic growth slowed, but there was no recession. The index last declined three consecutive months from June through August in 1984. There was no recession, but the economy did enter a two-year period of slow growth. Also, initial estimates of the index are frequently revised substantially in later months. For instance, within the last year, there were preliminary reports of declines for five consecutive months _ from September through January. However, later revisions wiped out all but two of those drops, in November and January.

 The government said Tuesday its chief forecasting gauge of future economic activity suffered the steepest drop in eight months in July, but few analysts expect a substantial slackening in growth anytime soon. The 0.8 percent decline in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Index of Leading Economic Indicators was the biggest since last November, when the index dropped 1.0 percent in the aftermath of the October stock market crash. However, economists noted that the index posted an exceptionally strong increase in June and cautioned against reading too much into a one-month downturn. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods plunged 3.5 percent in July, the worst decline in 18 months. But that drop followed a very strong showing in June and was heavily influenced by a wide swing in orders for military equipment. `` Despite the declines, we're not going to have any slowing in the imminent future,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the three months ended in June and at a 3.4 percent pace in the first quarter. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said this strong growth, which surprised many economists who had been anticipating a recession after the stock market crash, likely would continue through the July-September quarter. White House spokesman <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with the vacationing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said, `` The data suggest continued economic growth in the months ahead, although at a more moderate pace than in the first half'' of the year. Barring something unforeseen, the economy could turn in its strongest performance since 1984. That would be good news for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is counting on a feeling of economic optimism among voters to bolster his chances of beatwk Quayle measures up. In eight years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been known mostly f agan's Strategic Defense Initiative, his battle for the controversial federal court appointment of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Manion </PERSON> and a losing fight against the 60-day notification for plant closings `` I do n't remember anything in particular,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, when asked if he had squared off against <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on any other issues. And he makes repeated subtle references to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s youth. `` I certainly do n't think he's too young but certainly you've got to have some maturity'' to be a heartbeat away from the presidency, he said at one <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> stop When reporters goaded <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> with questions on whether <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would still be on the ticket Nov. 8, the Texan finally could n't resist. `` I hope so,'' he said. But away from the public eye, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and his top aides are concerned about going into debate against <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is younger than President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was when he won the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but his face looks older, especially on television.

 And holding his own might be good enough to be declared the winner, given the low expectations accorded the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator. `` We're on the wrong end of the expectations game, as far as the vice presidential debate is concerned, because everyone expects Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to do so well,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Peek </PERSON>, a long-time <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic strategist who is now a private consultant in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Other Democrats already are defending <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in advance of a debate that may never come off. `` The senator is concerned about a debate because his style as a senator is to get things done and he does n't engage in a lot of sparring on the floor,'' national party spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. On the other hand, `` It's easy to envision <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as a TV talk show host.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also must be careful not to bludgeon <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and win him a backlash of sympathy among voters, as has occurred in the recent controversy over <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> record. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, who studies politics at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, says the Democrats have reason to worry about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` He is not a dummy,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. In past debates, such as when he defeated incumbent <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> to win the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> showed `` when he was prepared, well-briefed, and focused, he could do all right.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, meanwhile, has the difficult task of not wanting to help the Republicans in their expectations game and also not wanting to speak well of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` It is n't in <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s interest to talk about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. So while he clearly sees <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as a lesser opponent, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> must focus his attacks away from the man and back to the issues and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s conservative voting record. `` I do n't want to get into his personal life. That I do n't want to do,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> says. Then <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> hints about which Republican would have been a worthy opponent. `` I thought it would be <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, frankly,'' he says. `` It's a real gamble picking <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, and I think it's going to be proven that way.''

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said Tuesday that ending the Iran-Iraq war will strengthen the oil cartel, but he gave no clue whether <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has agreed to let its foe have an oil production quota equal to its own. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s former Energy Minister, made the comments after a meeting with President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> arrived Monday from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> seeking to persuade <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to agree to allow <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> quota of at least 2.39 million barrels a day. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has refused to accept a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day, about half its current output, and insists on parity with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The deadlock, with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> pumping an estimated 2.5 million barrels a day to boost its revenue and repair its war-damaged economy, has worsened the problem of over-production by some <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member states. The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected oil industry weekly published in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said Monday the output by the 13-member cartel this month was around 20 million barrels a day. That's about 3.5 million barrels a day over <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s overall production quota and was seen as a key factor in depressing world oil prices. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> as saying <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members should strictly adhere to their quotas. But he too made no direct mention of the issue of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s quota. But he did note that among <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s prime concerns were <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> unity and resolving the organization's problems. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> was expected to fly to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s capital, through <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> Wednesday. He had talks Monday with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Oil Minister, <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> briefed <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> on his earlier visits to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on the over-production issue. But it gave no details. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> overcame a major stumbling block to its efforts to impose production discipline earlier this month after <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> dropped its veto against giving <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> a quota equal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s. Eleven of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> states now agree to that. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is now the only holdout. With the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations-sponsored </LOCATION> Aug. 20 cease-fire apparently holding, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have both started repairing oil facilities damaged in the nearly eight years of fighting Oil industry sources believe that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will be able to install makeshift oil loading terminals in the northern gulf within a few months, allowing it to boost its export capacity by 1 million barrels a day. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is also expanding its export pipeline network, which would increase its production capacity to more than 3 million barrels a day by the end of the decade. The Iranians are repairing the heavily bombed <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> island terminal, which accounts for 90 percent of their oil exports. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy oil minister, <ORGANIZATION> Khazempour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ardebili </ORGANIZATION> said earlier this month that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s long-term target is to boost production to around 4.5 million barrels a day, its pre-war level. But the Middle East Economic Survey noted that in the short term, production will likely only increase to around 2.8 million barrels a day.

 Grain and soybean futures closed sharply higher Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with the wheat market leading the way on news that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> each were seeking to buy 300,000 metric tons of subsidized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat.

 A federal judge said today that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> may curtail service but must return to the bargaining table and negotiate over the proposed layoffs of 4,000 employees. Eastern said it would file an emergency appeal, although it expressed satisfaction that the ruling would allow it to carry through with plans to drop some routes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had shown through testimony that it has the right to change schedules, reduce flights and close its hub at <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as the airline has proposed `` without first bargaining with the plaintiffs.'' The plaintiffs are three unions fighting <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to fire 4,000 workers. Eastern announced July 22 that it would close its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hub and eliminate 140 of its 1,225 flights daily. `` Testimony also supports the conclusion that the proposed operational changes are motivated by sound financial reasons,'' the judge wrote in a 50-page opinion. `` Even plaintiffs' experts agreed that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has legitimate and compelling business reasons to withdraw from the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hub.'' The judge wrote, however, that just because the cutbacks are necessary economically does not mean Eastern can bypass bargaining with its unions. `` Massive layoffs are not, and shall never be, business as usual,'' he wrote. `` The Railway Labor Act requires Eastern to bargain with its unions before taking unilateral action to eliminate 12 percent of its worforce.'' Included among those employees are 1,000 flight attendants, 1,000 machinists and 500 pilots. Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>, in a prepared statement from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> corporate headquarters, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was pleased its fall schedule has been left intact but would file an emergency appeal and request for stay because the order `` is gravely wrong.'' `` Eastern, like any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> business, must be allowed to prune money-losing operations,'' he said. `` We must be able to take prudent, although sometimes painful, measures in the best interests of the company and our employees.'' Bakes called <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s ruling `` a fundamental misreading'' of the Railway Labor Act that could `` profoundly disrupt the entire airline industry and undermine the very essence of deregulation.'' Union leaders in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said they wanted to study the ruling before commenting. Eastern's lawyers had no comment after a brief hearing in <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s court involving the bond that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is seeking from the three union plaintiffs. Such a bond protects a defendant for losses suffered if he should win on appeal. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> had issued a temporary restraining order against the furloughs on Aug. 4 and extended it last Friday. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> cited a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that many business decisions are subject to bargaining, including management actions taken to eliminate wasteful practices. The labor agreements Eastern made with its unions `` provide no justification for a wholesale restructuring of the air line workforce,'' he wrote. `` Employers subject to the RLA -LRB- Railway Labor Act -RRB- must bargain with their unions even over fundamental decisions affecting the very scope and direction of their employer's enterprise.''

 The stock market wallowed in more sluggish trading today but still managed to finish slightly higher, which some investment professionals considered an encouraging sign. They said the market's behavior today defied fears of profit-taking in the aftermath of the sharp runup of the previous session and suggested that big institutional investors are taking more interest in acquiring stocks. `` I was worried that if the institutions came in and sold stocks, we would have seen a tremendous vacuum on the downside,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, senior vice president and manager of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The buyers stepped up to the plate and took out a lot of sell interest.''

<HEAD>Flight Attendants Ask DOT to Investigate Icahn's Fitness</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is using <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> as his personal cash cow to the detriment of the airline and public safety, the flight attendants union charged Tuesday. The union asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> to block <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s plan to take <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> private and to freeze <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> assets while it investigates his fitness to continue managing the airline. <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankovich </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION>, charged that since <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> took control of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> a little more than two years ago, he has `` milked'' the airline's cash reserves and sold off assets to finance his stock market and takeover ventures rather than buy new airplanes and other safety equipment needed to assure <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s future Through spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> called <ORGANIZATION> IFFA </ORGANIZATION>'s allegations `` spurious, malicious and erroneous'' and designed `` to embarrass the airline.'' `` Today <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> has more planes, serves more airports and carries more passengers than in 1986,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said in a formal statement. Still, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet remains the oldest in the industry; the average plane is 14.6 years old, the union said. A <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 that landed on its belly Saturday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> when its landing gear failed to descend was 24 years old, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which still is investigating the cause of that incident. The union criticized <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to spend just 1 percent of the gross value of its fleet on new equipment this year while other airlines are spending about 15 or 20 percent on new, fuel-efficient planes. This, the union says, contributes to high maintenance costs and the airline's accident and incident rate, which according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is the worst among the top 10 American airlines. Old airplanes also cost more to maintain than new ones and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> will have to spend more and more to keep its planes safe, the union says. `` This would require a healthy cash flow,'' <PERSON> Frankovich </PERSON> said. `` But according to disclosures in <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s own filings before the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s cash flow is not expected to be sufficient to repay the increased debt to be incurred under his privatization plan.'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who owns 75 percent of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, will ask minority shareholders at a meeting Sept. 7 to sell their stock to him. Payments would be financed by the sale of $ 250 million in speculative, high-yield bonds. This would raise <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual interest payments to $ 466 million, almost double the airline's 1987 operating earnings of $ 240 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> IFFA </ORGANIZATION>'s analysis. In addition, for his <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> stock, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> would receive $ 400 million in <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> assets, including a big chunk of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock, the union said. `` <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> is being managed today not as an air carrier but as an unsupervised mutual fund benefiting Mr. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Frankovich </PERSON> said. `` Unless the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> acts now to stop him, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and his companies will take $ 650 million out of an already weakened <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and leave the flying public, his creditors and his long-suffering employees to reap the sad and perhaps tragic consequences,'' she added. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, in his statement, said: `` I have no doubt that <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> employees, the traveling public and the appropriate government officials will see through <ORGANIZATION> IFFA </ORGANIZATION>'s meritless charges and understand <ORGANIZATION> IFFA </ORGANIZATION>'s motivation.'' <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s machinists union, which also opposes the privatization and filed suit in federal court last week to stop it, is being asked to join the IFFA petition but has not yet had time to study it, <PERSON> Frankovich </PERSON> said. Unions at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> made a similar request to the DOT last year. In its findings the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> said acrimonious relations between labor and management could lead to operational problems and a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Labor was appointed to act as a mediator.

 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods fell sharply in July, pulled down by the biggest drop in defense orders in more than four years, the government said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for both durable and non-durable goods slipped 3.5 percent to $ 220.2 billion last month. It was the worst drop since January 1987, when orders fell 3.6 percent. But economists were not concerned about the decrease because it was heavily influenced by the volatile military goods category and came one month after the strongest increase in total orders in more than 17 years. `` The orders numbers were down because of some fluctuations in some very volatile categories. They'll be up again in August,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In July, defense orders plummeted 46.6 percent to $ 7.4 billion, reversing a 68.3 percent gain a month earlier. Last month's drop in this category was the steepest since April 1984. The June increase had been the biggest since December 1982. Excluding the defense category, orders were down 0.7 percent in July following a healthy 2.9 percent gain in June. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing, which languished earlier in the decade because of the strong dollar, has rebounded. The weaker dollar has fueled a resurgence in sales of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods overseas and businesses have responded by spending more to upgrade and replace outmoded plant and equipment. But demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods has been so strong that some analysts are concerned that factory capacity will be strained, pushing prices higher. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said that despite the overall drop in factory orders in July, `` there is very little evidence yet that the manufacturing sector is moderating.'' A particular sign of strength, he said, is the category of non-defense capital goods, which is considered a good indication of business expansion plans. It was up 0.9 percent to $ 35.8 billion, following a 12.5 percent increase in June. `` That, I think, is the more telling story. ... Despite the fact that last month's number was a strong increase, we were still able to scratch out a further increase this month,'' <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON> said. The overall July decline followed a 5.4 percent surge in June, the biggest since December 1970. Orders were down 0.3 percent in May. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offered these details of July activity: _ Total orders for durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years, were off 7.1 percent in July following an 8.7 percent gain in June _ Orders for transportation equipment, both military and non-military, were off 22.0 percent after soaring 33.3 percent a month earlier _ Non-electrical machinery was down 4.2 percent, while electrical machinery jumped 4.1 percent _ Orders for non-durable goods rose 1.0 percent after increasing 1.6 percent a month earlier _ Shipments of manufactured goods fell 0.9 percent to $ 216.9 billion, after rising 1.4 percent in June

 A federal judge Tuesday sentenced two former bank officers to prison for contributing to the near-collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1980s. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Shadur </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, 53, a former <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> vice president, to 3 -LCB- years in prison. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, former head of energy lending at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was sentenced to a 2-year term. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, 53, and <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, 38, had pleaded guilty June 30 to criminal charges in an alleged scheme that involved risky loans and kickbacks. Penn Square failed in 1982, and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> came close to collapse two years later after the largest run on desposits in banking history. They were scheduled to report to prison authorities on Oct. 11. Testifying before his sentencing Tuesday, <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> said he accepted responsibility for his actions. He asked the judge to sentence him to no more than six months in jail and then put him on probation and allow him to work with the poor on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. `` I wish desperately that I could reverse the events of the 1980s,'' <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shadur </PERSON>. `` In various ways and in increasing amounts, I have a desire to redeem myself. `` Working with poor children is an area where I'm experienced, where I have great love and where I have a track record. Please, your honor, give me an opportunity to give service,'' <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> pleaded. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, who held his head and cried as he spoke, said he was sorry for his actions and was concerned about his family. `` I'm sorry for the people in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I think of that a lot.'' But prosecutor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said the two men must be punished because they had abused a special trust. `` Society's rights and needs must take precedence over the defendants and their family,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> told the judge. `` Anything less would send a confusing message to the American people.'' <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> pleaded guilty to misapplication of bank funds and <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> pleaded guilty to charges that he aided and abetted <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>. The pleas came two months after the trial of the two men ended with a deadlocked jury. Prosecutors charged that <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> had manipulated <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and a third man, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> drilling contractor <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>, in schemes to save his own failing bank. <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> was acquitted of wire fraud charges. The government accused <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, caught in spiraling personal debt to finance a luxurious lifestyle, of accepting kickbacks from <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> in exchange for buying risky energy loans from <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. Defense attorneys contended <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which was kept afloat by a $ 4.5 billion government bailout, was saddled with the troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive lending policy.

<HEAD>Pork Futures Plunge Again On Signs Of Seasonal Slaughter Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Pork futures prices plunged for the second straight day Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid signs of an expected seasonal upturn in hog slaughters. On other markets, grain and soybean futures rose sharply; precious metals drifted lower; energy futures advanced; and stock-index futures retreated. A recent pickup in hog slaughters suggests last spring's unusually large pig crop is beginning to come to market at least two weeks later than expected, analysts said Supplies of fattened hogs typically rise in August but this year's crop _ the largest in five years _ was held back by producers fearful of transporting the sensitive animals in the recent record-breaking heat wave. `` You usually see the slaughter reach its lowest point in July, then it increases into November,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, Ill. Frozen pork-belly futures finished down nearly the 2-cents-a-pound limit Tuesday following limit losses on Monday, while hogs for December and February delivery lost more than a penny a pound. Because of the large spring pig crop, slaughters during the fall-winter period are expected to run 7 percent above last year's level, and hefty supplies of frozen pork will put additional pressure on prices, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, livestock market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> `` The market is jittery because we're going into the fall season with an 87 percent increase in frozen pork stocks from last year,'' he said. Expectations of the seasonal slaughter increase were offset last week by a strong cattle futures market, which kept prices in the adjacent pork pits from falling sharply, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. But meatpackers now have all the cattle they need to meet the Labor Day weekend demand, so cattle prices weakened Tuesday. Live cattle settled .08 cent to .88 cent lower with the contract for delivery in October at 72.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent to .83 cent lower with September at 81.82 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to 1.08 cents lower with October at 39.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.33 cents to 1.97 cents lower with February at 50.87 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures finished sharply higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with the wheat market leading the way on news that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> each were seeking to buy 300,000 metric tons of subsidized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced it had accepted bids to cover the sale of 200,000 metric tons of wheat to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Corn futures prices got an additional boost from news that a federal magistrate in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, had recommended the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> be ordered to extend indefinitely crop price-support loans scheduled to mature on Wednesday. The recommendation, if accepted by the judge hearing a case brought by several farmers, would delay the release of 400 million to 500 million bushels of corn onto the market. Wheat settled 7 -RCB- cents to 11 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.95 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 5 -RCB- cents higher with Setember at $ 2.79 a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 8 \ cents higher with September at $ 2.54 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 14 -LCB- cents to 23 cents higher with September at $ 8.47 a bushel Precious metals futures drifted lower in quiet trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The inflation-sensitive metals were reacting to ideas that the economy is beginning to slow down, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, commodity futures trading adviser for <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. That view was bolstered by Tuesday's report of a 0.8 percent drop in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Index of Leading Economic Indicators, the sharpest decline in eight months. Gold settled $ 1 to $ 1.60 lower with October at $ 431.90 a troy ounce; silver was 3 cents to 3.9 cents lower with September at $ 6.49 a troy ounce. Energy futures prices advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly storage report, which analysts said was bullish for the market. The API reported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil stocks dipped by 4.2 million barrels last week while distillate stocks fell by about 3 million barrels. Gasoline stocks rose by 699,000 barrels. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 13 cents higher with October at $ 15.27 a barrel; heating oil was .38 cent to .53 cent higher with September at 43.14 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .15 cent to .79 cent higher with September at 48.03 cents a gallon.

 The stock market wallowed through another slow session Tuesday but still managed a marginally higher finish, which some strategists interpreted as a positive signal in what has been a dreary dog-day August. `` I was worried that if the institutions came in and sold stocks, we would have seen a tremendous vacuum on the downside,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, senior vice president and head of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The buyers stepped up to the plate and took out a lot of sell interest.'' The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose 24 points Monday, overcame an early decline, stabilized but eroded near the close, finishing down 3.20 to 2,038.23. Broader market measurements were mostly higher. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> was the fourth-lowest this year at 108.72 million shares, compared with the Monday level of 99.23 million shares, the second-lowest, and the Friday volume of 89.24 million shares, the lowest. Traders offered a variety of reasons for the lethargic business, ranging pre-Labor Day vacationing to investor apathy that has pervaded the market all month. `` The volume is so thin, I think the trigger pullers are all out at the Hamptons,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON>, a market strategest at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <PERSON> Hildegarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON>, a stock analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, suggested many investors were awaiting the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report Friday on August unemployment, which could provide clear signals on the direction of the economy and interest rates, two key market concerns. `` Nobody's too willing to get into the market ahead of those numbers,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports Tuesday on the index of leading indicators and factory orders for July, she said, had little impact on Wall Street because the numbers were well within expectations. <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON> said that unlike the previous session, at least half the participation in the market Tuesday was from the big institutional investors that have the potential to incite a broad rally with healthier volumes. He said if the unemployment figures suggest the economy is slowing down, thereby easing the risk of inflation, `` a lot more participants will come into this market.'' Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7-to-6 in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 741 up, 644 down and 564 unchanged. Among the most prominent issues, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> jumped 7 -LRB- to $ 22.75 in a late spurt of buying on news that <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> would acquire the company for $ 23.25 a share. The announcement came shortly before the close of trading. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION>'s preferred stock advanced 5 -LCB- to 144 -LCB- after it announced further details of a plan to ease ownership restrictions. Blue chips were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> fell -LCB- to 112 ~, Union Carbide rose -RRB- to 22 -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> fell -LCB- to 60 -LRB- and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> rose \ to 40 -LCB- On the over-the-counter market, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> fell ~ to 18 -LRB-. The Wall Street Journal said in a front-page article that the computer software maker faced increased competition, falling market share and lower profits. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 129.19 million shares. The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, American and OTC issues, rose $ 1.91 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index rose 0.11 to 148.66. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 0.12 to 301.32, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index rose 0.18 to 262.51.

<TEXT>
 Court papers unsealed Tuesday show federal agents are trying to determine if <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> avoided paying millions of dollars in federal taxes through the way it accounted for spare parts. Besides <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's richest utilities, the investigation includes its parent, the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and the Big Eight accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The papers raise the question of whether the companies and their accountants sought to hide about $ 61 million in spare parts to avoid paying $ 50 million in federal taxes, interest and penalties. The complicated arrangement deals with whether parts are classified as being emergency spare parts or for maintenance and when they become expenses to the company. The papers also raise the question of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>'s accounting for the sale of 5 percent of Plant Vogtle nuclear power plant to the <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>. In the documents, officials say the deal was treated as a sale of 5 percent of the $ 8.87 billion plant for book value purposes, but as 1.35 percent for tax purposes, saving the company between $ 10 million and $ 12 million. The papers include excerpts of taped conversations in which <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s tax chief agrees with a confidential informant that the company misled the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> over the tax accounting of the spare parts, but adds, `` Do n't ever say that.'' The investigation, which dates from 1982, is based largely on information contained in taped conversations between utility and <LOCATION> Andersen </LOCATION> officials and the informant, who is being paid for his participation and been exempted from prosecution, according to the court papers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> confirmed the investigation, but refused to provide details beyond what was contained in the papers because a grand jury is involved. He said the investigation, which is continuing, involves possible criminal wrongdoing, including violations of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Tax Code. Although the court papers unsealed Tuesday focus on <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said other companies or individuals may be involved. The affidavit says Southern subsidiaries <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> used proper accounting procedures for spare parts. The Atlanta Constitution reported the investigation last week, after <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents executed search warrants at the downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> as well as the home of <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallaw </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s director of taxes. The Constitution said other companies being investigated include <ORGANIZATION> Oglethorpe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which provides electricity to electric cooperatives in the state. In a Tuesday afternoon news conference, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> said the allegations `` if true -LRB- are -RRB- shocking to me personally and I'm sure to the employees of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> said, `` I want to state as plainly as I can to you that I will not tolerate wrongdoing and I will not tolerate the coverup of wrongdoing at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and I personally will get to the bottom of this matter.'' <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> said the accounting for spare parts is `` one of those complex areas in the tax law that is open to legitimate disagreement among reputable accountants.'' The chairman refused to take questions. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Clappa </PERSON> said the holding company would have nothing further to add to <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>'s statement. Officials at <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> office had no immediate comment on the material.

 <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has filed a lawsuit charging it was defrauded last year when it purchased <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a retail electronics chain. In the suit, the personal computer and video game maker claimed it was defrauded of $ 43 million when it bought <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> in August 1987 and completed the acquisition in October for $ 64.1 million in cash. <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> charged that <PERSON> Wilfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s former chairman and principal stockholder, conspired with other <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> officers to misrepresent the value of the company's assets. <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> also sued <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whinney </LOCATION>, accountants for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> at the time of the acquisition, and <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the investment banking firm that represented <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> in the transaction. `` We stand behind our work,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Howarth </PERSON>, a spokesman for New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION>, said on Tuesday. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> said the company would not comment on the suit. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> filed the suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> _ which operated 68 stores in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> _ was losing money at the time it was acquired. <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> expected to engineer a quick turnaround of the company. However, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> has continued to lose money, and <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> closed six unprofitable stores of its new subsidiary. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> lost $ 9.6 million on sales of $ 71.5 million during the quarter ended April 2. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Tropper </PERSON>, corporate counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION>, said after the filing his company's auditors had detected $ 29 million in discrepancies in the value of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s assets before going ahead with the purchase. The last financial report before the <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> bid showed <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> with assets of some $ 200 million. <PERSON> Tropper </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> went ahead with the takeover after <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> agreed to have outside auditors review <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s books. <ORGANIZATION> Coopers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lybrand </ORGANIZATION>, the accounting firm that performed the audit, reported in February <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s assets had been overstated by $ 43 million.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday approved a 4-for-1 stock swap as part of its plan to open up ownership of its preferred stock to public investors and bring a more than $ 1 billion windfall to the savings and loan industry. The corporation, known as <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, is a congressionally created entity that buys home mortgages from savings institutions and other lenders and packages them into securities for resale to investors, making more money available for home buyers. Ownership of <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>'s 15 million preferred shares is currently restricted to the 2,500 savings institutions who are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> system. As part of an effort to bring new capital to the ailing industry, federal regulators in July voted in principle to lift restrictions on ownership of the preferred stock, which has no voting power. The price of the stock, which was $ 60 a share in early June, has soared. After Tuesday's announcment, spelling out details of how the ownership restrictions will be lifted, the stock rose $ 6.50 a share to $ 145 in trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, led by Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had been pressing federal regulators to funnel some of the windfall into the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the financially strapped fund that backs deposits in savings institutions Trade groups have opposed that, arguing it is important to bring new capital to the healthy segment of the industry, which owns most of the <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> stock. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, the top <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulator and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>'s board, repeated that regulators have decided <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>'s plan `` is clearly not going to be done.'' <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> said it will offer four new shares of preferred stock for each old share between Oct. 17 and Nov. 30. Public investors would not be permitted to purchase the stock until after Jan. 1. The corporation said it has retained the right to rescind the entire exchange offer if fewer than two-thirds of the shares are turned in. However, it approved two provisions designed to encourage the exchange. Each new share will be guaranteed at least a fourth of the dividends paid to an old share, but could receive more. Also, old shares not exchanged before Nov. 30 could later be swapped for only 3.5 new shares.

<TEXT>
 Federal investigators have seized documents related to <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s work on the MX missile program, a company spokesman said Tuesday. The documents were seized during a search last week at the company's electronics division in <LOCATION> Hawthorne </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON>. He said the company was cooperating in the investigation. `` Basically it related to contractual information concerning our work on the MX,'' <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON> said of the documents. The Los Angeles Times, quoting anonymous sources, reported Tuesday the documents included an internal audit report on purchasing problems and records on tests of a key MX guidance component. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s program to build the component, called an inertial measurement unit, has been plagued with problems, including late deliveries and allegations of overcharging and use of defective parts. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office refused to comment on the search. About a month ago, authorities searched the home of former <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON>, one of several whistleblowers who alleged the company used defective parts in the inertial measurement units. Investigators sought documents `` relating to a purchasing fraud with the MX and any coverup,'' <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON> told the Times. Hyatt originally cooperated with the government, but since has had a disagreement with investigators. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> has brought production of the inertial measurement unit up to schedule, <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON> said. As of July 31, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> was withholding $ 20 million in payments for the units. That was down from a high of $ 145 million withheld in December 1987 for slow deliveries, <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, one of the most scrutinized of military contractors, is one of three <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> aerospace companies whose offices were searched last month in the nationwide investigation of allegations that defense industry consultants bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials to win contracts. The company has said it is cooperating in the probe. Also this summer, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began an investigation into <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s payment of more than $ 7 million to Korean businesses in connection with attempts to sell its F-20 fighter jet to the South Korean military.

The dollar moved lower in early domestic dealings after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported its <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION> fell 0.8 percent in July, the largest drop in eight months. The number was slightly weaker than expected, but the market soon shrugged off the figure. Traders said there was no reaction to a separate report that showed factory orders down 3.5 percent in July, the worst drop in 18 months. `` We're entrenched in a narrow range,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cally </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The only interesting move during the session came against the Japanese yen. The dollar briefly pierced the key 135 level against the yen before settling lower. Traders said a rumor that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> planned to tax certain stock-trading profits weakened the Japanese currency. `` The market is very much trying to get its claws into something that will give it a new sense of direction, but until that comes, we'll just kind of flake around,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sapiro </PERSON>, head trader at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. European traders said they were looking to Friday's unemployment data for July to liven the currency markets. But <PERSON> Sapiro </PERSON> noted many traders may not participate in dealings Friday as they get a jump on the long Labor Day weekend. `` Any reaction might just be an exaggeration,'' <PERSON> Sapiro </PERSON> said. Traders also are concerned that any significant upward move by the dollar will probably be met with a new round of central bank intervention. According to an analyst in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, `` The dollar is caught between the possibility of interest rates going up and the certainty of central bank intervention.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.19 yen to a closing 134.39. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 134.45 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 134.93 yen, from 134.54 yen on Monday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.6910, slightly more expensive for buyers than $ 1.6840 quoted in European markets late Monday. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial markets were closed Monday for a bank holiday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it cost $ 1.6875 to buy one pound, more expensive than Monday's $ 1.6809. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday, included: 1.8664 West German marks, down from 1.8720; 1.5765 Swiss francs, down from 1.5778; 6.3385 French francs, down from 6.3420; 1,3860.00 Italian lire, down from 1,390.50, and 1.2362 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2386.

<HEAD>Continental Introduces Money-Back Guarantee; New Companion Fare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, seeking to lure business travelers wary of its reputation for poor service, on Tuesday announced a new money-back service guarantee for first-class passengers. Under the program, effective Sept. 19 through Oct. 31, first-class fliers can get a refund of as much as $ 200 if they are not satisfied with any aspect of their domestic flights, from making reservations to claiming their baggage when they arrive. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said the unconditional service refund is the first such guarantee offered by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline. Passengers are entitled to a refund if they are unhappy with in-flight meals, if flights are delayed or for any other reason. `` There are no questions asked; there's no fine print,'' <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON> told a news conference. `` We're willing to put our money on the line.'' Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of giant <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, generally is known for its aggressive fare cutting. <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON> conceded it was no secret that <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> suffered from a reputation for inferior service. However, he said, the airline has improved its on-time performance so it now ranks third among the major carriers, according to government statistics. The airline was in last place this past winter. The airline's poor service record `` is all history,'' <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON> said. `` We have total confidence in our service product.'' <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> also announced a new fare of $ 79 each way for companions of passengers traveling on its MaxSaver discount fares anywhere in the mainland <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The companion fare can be used for travel between Sept. 7 and Dec. 15. A $ 79 companion fare also was announced by Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the other major carrier owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern said the new Companion MaxSaver, valid during the same period, will reduce the cost of two people traveling together by more than 30 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a competitor, said it was matching the $ 79 companion fares for vacation travelers `` who are looking for a fall fling.'' <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> also introduced a 10 percent discount for passengers over age 65 for travel within the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland, and two year-long tickets for senior citizens allowing unlimited travel within the mainland for $ 1,299 and worldwide for $ 2,299. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said it is cutting its unrestricted fares by as much as 70 percent and simplifying its price structure on nonstop flights between <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and 38 cities. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> is striving to increase its market share in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, one of its major hubs. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s main competitor in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said Tuesday it planned to match fare cuts in that market. Under the money-back guarantee, passengers must submit a refund form available from ticket agents. Fliers will receive refund checks in about six to eight weeks, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said. The offer is limited to three refunds per passenger. <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON> said there is a strong possibility the guarantee program could be extended beyond the Oct. 31 expiration. Passengers who paid $ 500 to $ 699 for first-class, round-trip tickets are eligible for a $ 100 refund. Fliers who paid $ 700 to $ 899 can get back $ 150, and those paying more than $ 900 are entitled to $ 200.

<HEAD>Lower Price Drawing Higher Interest In Offshore Oil Lease Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government is scheduled to open Wednesday 371 bids made by oil companies hoping to snap up 270 tracts of bargain-priced oil properties in the western Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. It will be the third Gulf lease sale since the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> dropped the minimum per-acre price on the property from $ 150 to $ 25. And it's the second time western Gulf tracts are up for bids. Interest appeared high, with 93 companies qualifiying to bid. Eighty-four qualified for the central Gulf sale last March. However, when the number of bids actually was totaled Tuesday afternoon, it was far below the 931 bids received last March for the central Gulf properties. <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelico </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the number was down for two reasons First, the central Gulf waters are considered to be better oil properties. Second, the western gulf tracts were up for bids a year ago shortly after the minimum bids were lowered to $ 25 per acre. Almost 520 bids were received on the tracts then. The lower price is still seen as a means of boosting interest in the offshore tracts, <PERSON> Angelico </PERSON> said. `` We see it as an incentive to the smaller companies,'' she said. The western gulf territory covers about 5,080 underwater blocks covering about 27.9 million acres, mostly off the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast but some in deep waters off the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> shore. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are both suffering economically from the domestic oil industry's depression and renewed interest in offshore leases was hailed as good news by industry representatives at the March sale. But a spokesman for one company cautions that the sale of more leases wo n't necessarily be followed by more drilling. `` That's driven more by other things,'' said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vehnekamp </PERSON>, public affairs manager for <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> office. The government gives the lease purchasers several years _ the number varies according to the type and location of the tract _ to exercise drilling rights, <PERSON> Vehnekamp </PERSON> said. Drilling costs, prices for the product and numerous other market factors come into play, he said. Bids will be opened beginning at 9 a.m. Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Settlement Said Near In Champion Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Negotiators on Tuesday reached a tentative agreement that could end a strike by about 2,400 <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> wood products workers in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woodworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America-U.S. </ORGANIZATION>, refused comment on the offer, which is subject to approval by the <ORGANIZATION> IWA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. Ratification votes would be complete and results would be announced by Saturday, said <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON>. He refused to speculate on the offer's chances of approval. If the Champion workers settle, only about 1,800 workers would remain off the job in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> timber strike that began June 6. At its peak, the walkout idled about 9,000 workers in five states. Workers are still striking at <ORGANIZATION> DAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lakeview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, non-striking workers narrowly approved a contract agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> In another development, <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> representatives said they were scheduled to meet with union bargainers in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> on Thursday. About 6,000 <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> workers in the region were not affected by the walkout. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Draper </PERSON>, executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> ratification vote was quite close, but neither official would release any numbers or percentages on the balloting. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Odgers </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the new pact is similar to the recent agreement involving <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has produced a pattern for settlements in the industry. <PERSON> Odgers </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> contract calls for a $ 1,400 bonus in the first year, with basic pay increases of 11 percent over the remaining length of the four-year agreement.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, currently considering restructuring or a possible sale of the company, said Tuesday it lost $ 9.4 million during its second quarter. The retailer and shoe manufacturer's loss in the quarter ended July 30 compared with earnings of $ 5.5 million, or 12 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. The company reported sales of $ 544.4 million, up from $ 511.1 million a year earlier. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Shoe has been hit hard by the slump in apparel sales. The company has hired <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> to suggest ways to maximize its shareholder value, including the possible restructuring or sale of all or parts of the company. The company, which has been mentioned as a prime takeover target, said its results reflected a one-time gain of $ 7.3 million from the sale of several divisions and $ 3.1 million in charges, partly attributable to the closing of stores in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Shoe's 1,700 specialty stores include <ORGANIZATION> Casual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corner </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ups </ORGANIZATION>' N Downs, <PERSON> Caren </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lenscrafters </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Tuesday stopped <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> from firing 4,000 employees but allowed the financially strapped carrier to go ahead with cutting back service to 14 cities on Wednesday as planned. Eastern said it will go ahead with the cuts. Its hub in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> will be eliminated and flights will be cut from 53 to 6, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>. `` Massive layoffs are not, and shall never be business as usual,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said in a 50-page opinion. `` The Railway Labor Act requires Eastern to bargain with its unions before taking unilateral action to eliminate 12 percent of its workforce.'' He signed a preliminary injunction that bars Eastern from `` altering in any way the status quo working condition of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots, machinists and flight attendants. A trial in the matter will be scheduled later. Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> called the decision `` gravely wrong'' and said the carrier would file an emergency appeal. `` Eastern, like any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> business, must be allowed to prune money-losing operations,'' Bakes said in a statement released at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We must be able to take prudent, although sometimes painful, measures in the best interests of the company and our employees.'' Lawyers for the three unions that brought the court action against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> submitted financial statements and <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> ordered bonds of $ 25,000 each to indemnify the airline if the decision is reversed. Meantime, the airline said, `` Eastern's basic fall schedule remains intact. Travel agents and pasengers can continue to book flights with full confidence that the schedule will be as announced.'' `` This is a case of protecting work and protecting jobs,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He said the decision `` does n't second-guess the business decisions of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to fly from Point A to Point B or to limit service in particular cities.'' Asked what Eastern might do with thousands of employees it claims not to need, <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON> replied: `` They get transferred, like any company transfers employees from one plant to another.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> wrote that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which bought <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, `` has exerted every effort to curb union influence at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and to reduce wage rates and economic benefits previously obtained.'' He said there were many `` indications of anti-union bias'' and that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, had expressed that view on many occasions. `` Since the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s management has contributed to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s financial instability,'' the judge wrote `` Through a series of business decisions, management has led the company into a number of questionable loans and questionable ventures which have drained off cash reserves and other assets.'' The centerpiece of the opinion was that Eastern could not proceed with the mass firings. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> did not dwell on the airline's plans to close its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hub and cut service to 14 cities. The airline claimed it would save $ 50 million by the service terminations and $ 7 million in payroll. It would cut 140 of its 1,225 daily flights and sell between 33 and 41 airplanes. The cities Eastern targeted to cut are <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; Pointe-a-Pitre, <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> wrote that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has shown through testimony that it has the right to change schedules, reduce flights and close its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hub as proposed `` without first bargaining with the plaintiffs. He said there is no question that the cutbacks `` are motivated by sound financial reasons.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheri </PERSON>, airline coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters: `` This tells us one thing. That union-buster Mr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is not above the law of the land ... Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and his hand-picked lieutenants can not lay off 4,000 employees.'' <PERSON> Scheri </PERSON> said the seven days of hearings that resulted in the judge's ruling exposed `` that Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and company were not really trying to keep <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> in business but to dismantle it and transfer assets and destroy three labor unions.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> wrote, however, that just because the cutbacks are necessary economically does not mean Eastern can bypass bargaining with its unions. `` While it is true that the collective bargaining agreements contain furlough provisions, they provide no justification for a wholesale restructuring of the airline work force,'' he said. Among the employees <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> wanted for lay off are 1,000 flight attendants, 1,000 machinists and 500 pilots, the ruling said. The other workers affected by the order were not specified. The flight attendants are represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which Joined <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union in the suit. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> had issued a temporary restraining order against the furloughs on Aug. 4 and extended it last Friday. In his ruling Tuesday, he cited a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that many business decisions are subject to bargaining, including management actions taken to eliminate wasteful practices. The labor agreements Eastern made with its unions `` provide no justification for a wholesale restructuring of the airline workforce,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> wrote. `` Employers subject to the RLA -LRB- Railway Labor Act -RRB- must bargain with their unions even over fundamental decisions affecting the very scope and direction of their employer's enterprise.'' The unions brought their suit under the Railway Labor Act, which requires carriers and the bargaining representatives of labor to preserve and maintain working conditions that exist before a labor dispute.

 <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> laid off 656 employees Tuesday, or 15.9 percent of its workforce, in the latest cutbacks under a major cost-cutting program. The state's largest utility had 4,126 full-time positions before the job eliminations. Tuesday's cuts boosted job eliminations to 19.4 percent of its workforce, and followed the layoffs of 129 union workers from <ORGANIZATION> PNM </ORGANIZATION>'s electrical operations and the elimination of all 14 jobs in its aviation department. `` Our goal is to have earnings such that we can continue dividends and regain our financial health,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Geist </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PNM </ORGANIZATION> president and chairman. <PERSON> Geist </PERSON> said jobs were cut from operations across the state and from all levels of the company, including 30 percent reductions in the corporate office. He said the job cuts would save $ 28.4 million in salaries, wages and benefits a year and that non-labor cost-cutting measures would save $ 15.4 million. <ORGANIZATION> PNM </ORGANIZATION> officials also announced construction expenses were cut by $ 19 million in 1988 and $ 33.6 million in budgeted 1989 levels. <PERSON> Geist </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> PNM </ORGANIZATION> dropped its employee stock purchase plan and imposed an across-the-board salary freeze until the middle of next year. Executive salaries and benefits were cut in January, so the latest salary freeze is an extended freeze for <ORGANIZATION> PNM </ORGANIZATION> officials, he said. <PERSON> Geist </PERSON> said Tuesday actions would not affect the reliability or safety of electrical or gas service, but would slow the utility's response time for things such as requests for new service The utility's financial problems over the past year are largely due to a huge excess generating capacity. Its share of costs of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and a unit of the coal-fired San Juan Generating Station near <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION> are not included in its rates. Earnings dropped 38 percent between 1986 and 1987 and have continued dropping this year, <PERSON> Geist </PERSON> said. Shareholder dividends have been cut by nearly 50 percent, he said. <ORGANIZATION> PNM </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, which climbed to a high of $ 39 in early 1987, rose $ 1.25 to $ 13.75 a share Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.
