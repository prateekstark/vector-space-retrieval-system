<HEAD>Reports Former Saigon Officials Released from Re-education Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 150 former officers of the overthrown South Vietnamese government have been released from a re-education camp after 13 years of detention, the official <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. The report from <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, did not give specific figures, but said those freed Friday included an ex-Cabinet minister, a deputy minister, 10 generals, 115 field-grade officers and 25 chaplains. It quoted Col. <PERSON> Luu </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ham </PERSON>, director of the Nam Ha camp south of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, as saying all 700 former South Vietnamese officials who had been held at the camp now have been released. They were among 1,014 South Vietnamese who were to be released from re-education camps under an amnesty announced by the Communist government to mark Tet, the lunar new year that begins Feb. 17. The <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> report said many foreign journalists and a delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> Australia-Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> attended the Nam Ha release ceremony. It said Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Nghi </PERSON>, former commander of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Third </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, and Col. <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Duc </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infantry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, expressed `` gratitude to the government for its humane treatment in spite of the fact that most of them -LRB- detainees -RRB- had committed heinous crimes against the country and people.'' The prisoners had been held without formal charges or trial since <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> defeated the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government in April 1975, ending the Vietnam War. Communist authorities had called the prisoners war criminals and said they had to learn how to become citizens of the new society. Small numbers had been released occasionally without publicity but the government announced last year that 480 political prisoners would be freed to mark National Day on Sept. 2. On Thursday, Vice Minister of Information <PERSON> Phan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quang </PERSON> said 1,014 would be released under the Tet amnesty. He reported a total of 150 prisoners would remain in the camps, which he said once held 100,000. `` Depending on their repentance, they will gradually be released within a short period of time,'' <PERSON> Quang </PERSON> said. He said many of the former inmates would return to their families in <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, formerly the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>. The amnesties apparently are part of efforts by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> to heal internal divisions and improve <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s image abroad.

<TEXT>
 The ripples from the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> precinct caucuses are spreading to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, boosting winners and damaging losers in the final days before the nation's first primary, polls indicate. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was slipping in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> even before his third-place <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> finish, lost more ground in polls this week. Democratic third-place finisher <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also lost support, but not as much. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, meanwhile, has boosted the candidacies of Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, the Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> winners, and has aided <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s surprise second-place <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> finisher, the polls indicate As recently as two weeks ago, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commanded the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> GOP field. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll in the last week of January had him 22 percentage points over <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the same place he'd held in polls since November and earlier But a crack appeared last week, when an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead sharply diminished, to 7 percentage points. After <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s vote Monday, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> found the spread down to 4 percentage points: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 33, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, 29. In a poll with an error margin of 6 percentage points, that amounted to a dead heat. Another survey, done for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> this week by pollster <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Orren </PERSON>, had essentially he same result: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 29, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 27. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday had it as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 35, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 27 _ still a big drop for the vice president. `` <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> got a very big kick out of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; more than that, there is some reluctance in the support for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Orren </PERSON> said Thursday. `` He's shown vulnerability, and that's sort of arousing doubts people have about him.'' `` The unanswered question is how far <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will fall,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>, polling director for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` The expectation is that he will continue to drop. That's been the clear direction.'' If voters were leaving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, it was not clear where they were going, <PERSON> Morin </PERSON> said. This week the chief gainers turned out to be <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, whose support was up to 10 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS polls, from 6 percent last week and 4 percent two weeks ago. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> held steady at 13 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll, and fell from 16 percent to 12 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll. Analysts said he now may be challenged by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> for third place in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was gaining last week. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> ended that,'' said <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s effect on the Democratic race probably is in the battle for second place, not first, pollsters said. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, despite finishing third in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, maintained a strong lead in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> _ but he no longer had the huge 49 percent support indicated in an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll in November. Three polls indicated a drop in support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, to 36 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Post </ORGANIZATION> survey this week from 41 percent last week; to 35 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>'s survey, from 38 percent last week; and to 38 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll, from 40 percent in late January. A fourth new poll, however _ done for <ORGANIZATION> WBZ-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WRC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> _ said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support had risen from 36 percent at the end of January to 44 percent this week. `` It's a big lead for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> no matter whose poll you're looking at _ and a strong one, too,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON>, chief of polling for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> He said 58 percent of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' backers told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> they supported him strongly. The win in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> transformed <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who had single-digit support in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> as recently as last month. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll had him at 19 percent, up from 7 percent in late January; <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s poll put him this week at 22 percent, up from 13 percent last week The Globe had him at 18 percent, up from 8, and the <ORGANIZATION> WBZ </ORGANIZATION> poll had him at 17, up from 8 last month. Poll results were more mixed on <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s chief rival, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the second-place finisher in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. He moved to 18 percent from 13 percent in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s poll, to 13 from 11 in <ORGANIZATION> WBZ </ORGANIZATION>'s and fell in the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>'s, to 12 from 17 He held about even in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll, at 15 percent this week. Movement is taking place at the bottom as well as the top of the pack. Former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, who had 11 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> WBZ </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> polls last week, fell to single-digit support after winning just 1 percent in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, also a poor finisher in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, went from 7 percent in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> poll last week to 4 percent this week

<HEAD>Parents Of Slain Man Drop Lawsuit Against Mexican Drug Lord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The parents of a student slain when he apparently stumbled onto a reputed Mexican drug lord's party have dropped a $ 2 billion lawsuit against the man, saying a trial would rekindle painful memories. <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Radelat </PERSON>, a dental student, and journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> were tortured and killed in February 1985 in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and authorities there said they believed the men were executed because they were mistaken for drug agents. On Jan. 29, Dr. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Radelat </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Ana </PERSON>, filed a wrong death action against reputed drug lord <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, whom authorities have blamed for the deaths. The younger <PERSON> Radelat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> had apparently entered a restaurant where <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> was holding an after-hours party. A witness told the Radelats that their son and <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> were stabbed with icepicks and switchblades before they were dumped in a crude grave outside <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, where their bodies were found in June 1985. On Thursday, <PERSON> Radelat </PERSON> said he dropped the suit a week after filing it because it would revive memories the family had tried to put behind them. `` My wife had settled down, and this brought it all up again,'' he said. `` We do n't want any more bad memories. It was a sad experience. I hope no one ever has to go through it.'' <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> was among nine people indicted Jan. 6 by federal officials in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> deaths </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his pilot, who were killed about a week after <PERSON> Radelat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> were slain. <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> is in a Mexican jail charged with all four deaths; <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities indicted him and the others in <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s death in an effort to bring them to justice if Mexican authorities do n't prosecute them <PERSON> Radelat </PERSON> said he filed the lawsuit because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had not indicted <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> in the other deaths. `` We were disappointed they -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials -RRB- indicted <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> just for the drug agent, not the other Americans,'' <PERSON> Radelat </PERSON> said. `` We wanted to do this -LRB- suit -RRB- not so much for the money but just to do justice for our son.''

<TEXT>
 Price supports for peanuts grown under 1988 quotas will be $ 615.27 per ton, an increase of $ 7.80 from last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the increase was required by a formula in the law which takes rising production costs into consideration. The annual quota is set at a level equal to the estimated quantity of peanuts that will be needed for domestic edible uses, seed and related purposes. Production of non-quota peanuts, which can be grown for peanut oil and meal, and for export, will be supported at $ 149.75 per ton, unchanged from last year, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. In setting the support for non-quota peanuts, officials are required to consider certain factors, including the demand for oil and meal, the expected prices for other vegetable oils and meals, and the foreign demand for peanuts.

 The end was bitter, his helmet dented from the combat of the campaign, and true to form, retired four-star Gen. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> reined in his dark horse quest for the presidency in a pugnacious mood. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> made clear that his new objective was not to seek the keys to the White House for himself but to deny them to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. From the very beginning, when he announced, `` I'm throwing my helmet into the ring,'' the 63-year-old former secretary of state never rose above the low single digits in public opinion polls. He stopped campaigning in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses in frustration that his message and his personality had not taken hold. `` This is hangover day,'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said, when the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> votes were counted and he ended up with less than 3 percent of the vote in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> field. Throughout his campaign, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> described himself as `` the darkest of dark horses.'' His political picture never brightened, perhaps because he failed to find a way to do what he himself said he had to do to win. `` I've learned the secret of life ... It's in marketing,'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> audience early in the campaign. `` And that's what I'm trying to do today _ marketing.'' After <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> had trouble finding a silver lining. `` I'm in it to the bitter end and that bitter end may be the inability to raise enough money to stay in it,'' he said. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> has been supreme allied commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and White House chief of staff as well as secretary of state and presidential contender. In all of those roles, he demonstrated a vivid _ sometimes pungent _ grasp of the English language. When his hopes for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> were still high, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> told audiences: `` I think it's important that a city slicker like <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, who's been abroad and lived in our nation's capital perhaps too long, does n't come out here and tell agricultural experts how to suck eggs. Complaining about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's supply-side economic policies, he said they bore the mark of `` ideological religiosity.'' He himself described some of his more obscure references and word combinations as `` Haigspeak.'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> sensed a measure of public reluctance to put a former four-star general in the White House and his first television commercials were designed to counter that. One listed the names of the dozen generals who have served as president, asserting that none of the nation's eight wars began in their administrations. ` Ive led troops in battle, seen the horror of war, I know the imperative of peace,'' the former general said, asserting the need to elect a president with `` strength, skill and understanding.'' He said the idea of a nuclear-free world is `` bizarre,'' asserting that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear weapons can only be detered by other nuclear weapons, not eliminated. When the stock market crashed last October, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had sown the seeds of disaster. `` Overnight the famous bull market of the eighties was eaten alive by the most infamous bear market in our financial history,'' he said, attributing the market's nose dive to `` a pervasive lack of confidence in our government's ability to deal with budget and trade deficits.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a preoccupation for much of the <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> campaign. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> tried repeatedly to pin down the vice president on what advice he gave to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the Iran-Contra scandal. `` Were you in the cockpit,'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said in typically colorful language, `` or were you on an economy ride in the back of the plane?''

 A court ruled Friday that an egg producer who kept his 2,000 hens in small cages was not guilty of cruelty to animals, as alleged by animal rights activists. `` The verdict is a great relief. It would have been too much to be found guilty of cruelty to my 2,000 hens,'' <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Wettre </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the national <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> news agency after his acquittal.

 Strategists for <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s presidential campaign say <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s poor showing in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, coupled with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s tough-talking ads against <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, could put <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> in the running for the Republican nomination. Before last Monday's <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> had been on a roll in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, using an effective advertising campaign and the endorsement of the influential Concord Monitor to help broaden support. But even as his bid to become the conservative alternative to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took shape, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman faced the possibility of being swept out of the race by former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. Using his second-place finish in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> came in fourth _ <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was trying to move <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> aside and take the mantle of true conservative. A poll of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> voters by the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> Thursday night indicated <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had drawn even with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> among potential <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> voters in next Tuesday's primary. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> campaign manager, says the <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> congressman wants to finish second or third in a cluster with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` We want to be in the 28-30-31 percent range with them,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said. He conceded that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> can not afford another fourth-place finish, saying, `` We need to do well here so we can raise money and continue on to the South. We need to have at least a close third here.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> spent most of the week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> making his case at coffee klatches, before high school students and in speeches to the party faithful. He is hopeful that his energetic person-to-person style and strong conservative message will make him the conservative alternative. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> is <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s chief campaign strategist. `` What you saw tonight,'' <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> spoke before 800 Republicans in <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION> earlier this week, `` was <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> making an appeal to the heart and soul of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vote in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. We consider that to be the largest single vote in the Republican primary electorate.'' <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s third-place finish in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> presented <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> with a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> opportunity he never thought he would see. `` It was a lucky break that the guy who got severely wounded in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, -LRB- someone -RRB- we never thought we could beat in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s strategy had focused on <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> because, as <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> put it, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is `` extraordinarily vulnerable in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> because of his predilection for raising taxes, his four different positions on oil import fees and his wanting to cut Social Security in a state that has an elderly, Republican electorate.'' `` We learned a lesson last month in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said. `` The news media was interested in Bush-Dole, <PERSON> Dole-Bush </PERSON>, Bush-Dole, almost as if they were the only two variables. `` The lesson was that by being very specific on issues in a tough, hard-hitting way, we could pry the door open to get people to take a look at <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is now running ads in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> saying he is the best alternative to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and noting that he has already beaten <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> says <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> ca n't repeat his showing in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> because of an inherently negative message that wo n't be effective in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` For all the voters who may be more comfortable with the gloom and doom and dour message of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, that we're going to hell in a handbasket, there are many more who will respond to a positive conservative message,'' <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said. `` I'm a conservative,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told a living room full of Republicans in <LOCATION> Milford </LOCATION>. `` But I'll tell you what, folks, some things need money spent on them. We've got to shelter the homeless; we've got to feed and clothe and take care of people who ca n't take care of themselves ... and we've got to have a strong defense.''

 About 90 soldiers have been arrested and face possible death sentences stemming from a coup attempt in <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>, leaders of the tribal homeland said Friday. Rebel soldiers staged the takeover bid Wednesday, detaining homeland President <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangope </PERSON> and several top Cabinet officials for 15 hours before South African soldiers and police rushed to the homeland, rescuing the leaders and restoring them to power.

He said the accused were to appear in court Monday. All those arrested in the coup attempt have been described as young troops, the most senior being a warrant officer. During the coup rebel soldiers installed as head of state Rocky Malebane-Metsing, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Malebane-Metsing escaped capture and his whereabouts remained unknown, officials said. Several unsubstantiated reports said he fled to nearby <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>. Warrant Officer M.T.F. <PERSON> Phiri </PERSON>, described by <PERSON> Mangope </PERSON> as one of the coup leaders, was arrested Friday in <LOCATION> Mmabatho </LOCATION>, capital of the nominally independent homeland, officials said. <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>, which has a population of 1.7 million spread over seven separate land blocks, is one of 10 tribal homelands in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. About half of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks live in the homelands, none of which are recognized internationally. <PERSON> Hennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Riekert </PERSON>, the homeland's defense minister, said South African troops were to remain in <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> but will not become a `` permanent presence.'' <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathebe </PERSON> defended <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s intervention. `` The fact that ... the South African government -LRB- was invited -RRB- to assist in this drama is not anything new nor peculiar to <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rathebe </PERSON> said. `` But why <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, one might ask? Because she is the only country with whom <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> enjoys diplomatic relations and has formal agreements.'' <PERSON> Mangope </PERSON> described the mutual defense treaty between the homeland and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as `` similar to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> agreement,'' referring to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> military alliance. He did not elaborate. Asked about the causes of the coup, <PERSON> Mangope </PERSON> said, `` We granted people freedom perhaps ... to the extent of planning a thing like this.'' The uprising began around 2 a.m. Wednesday when rebel soldiers took <PERSON> Mangope </PERSON> and his top ministers from their homes to the national sports stadium. On Wednesday evening, South African soldiers and police stormed the stadium, rescuing <PERSON> Mangope </PERSON> and his Cabinet. South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and three of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers flew to <LOCATION> Mmabatho </LOCATION> late Wednesday and met with <PERSON> Mangope </PERSON>, the homeland's only president since it was declared independent in 1977. The South African government has said, without producing evidence, that the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may be linked to the coup. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, dismissed the claims and said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s actions showed that it maintains tight control over the homeland governments. The group seeks to topple the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> government. The African National Congress and other anti-government organizations consider the homelands part of an apartheid system designed to fragment the black majority and deny them political rights in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A senior <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> diplomat broke with his country's military-dominated government Friday, declaring he could no longer in good conscience serve a regime stained by `` corruption, illigitimacy and dishonesty.'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabrega </PERSON>, minister counselor at <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s mission to the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> here, told a news conference his decision to resign was triggered by a speech he was ordered to give at an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> ceremony on Wednesday <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> had said in the speech that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was attempting to overthrow the Panamanian government and was waging a campaign of `` moral and economic aggresion'' against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` These remarks were not written by me, nor did they represent the way I feel or think,'' <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> said, adding that they were prepared by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON>, and the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON>'s resignation followed an extraordinary week in which Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-related charges and was accused by former associates before a congressional panel of engaging in an array of corrupt activities. Speaking through a translator at <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> said: `` My conscience, my dignity and my deep religious beliefs prevent me from continuing to be used as an instrument of a government characterized by corruption, illigitimacy and dishonesty.'' <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mission had no statement on <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON>'s resignation, and Ambassador <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON> was not available for comment. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ambassador who has been lobbying in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rule, said <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON>'s resignation proves there are `` worthy individuals'' in the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government who refuse to continue supporting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> said he did not resign on the day of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> ceremony because he felt it was inappropriate, given the nature of the event. The occasion was the formal incorporation of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> into an international agreement designed to guarantee the neutrality of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> once the waterway comes under Panamanian control in the year 2000. In his speech Wednesday, <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> had said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in pursuing a hostile attitude toward the Panamanian government, was attempting to evade its treaty pledge to relinquish control over the canal. On Friday, he said he believes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will faithfully comply with its commitments. <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> said he was not seeking political asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and was confident he would not be the target of reprisals by the Panamanian government. He will be ineligible to remain in this country because his visa allowing him to remain here is valid only so long as he maintained his status as a diplomat. He said he has about a month to decide what to do in the future. <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON>, 46, served in the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> post for a year and a half. He previously had worked in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, its embassy in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and its embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> accredited to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. He and his wife are expecting their fourth child.

 <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, struggling to keep his presidential candidacy alive in the final days before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, lashed out Friday at fellow Republicans <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. At a news conference in this snowbound city, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said: `` What <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> says seems to depend on what state he's in.'' He also called <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> `` a big spender.'' With the departure of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> from the Republican presidential race on Friday, <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, a former governor of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, ranks at the bottom of the five-candidate field. He conceded that to stay in the race after Tuesday's primary `` you have to do well. You have to start beating somebody.'' <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> had kind words for <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, a former secretary of state, calling him `` a credit to this process'' and saying `` he brought a little spice to the debate.'' But he had no kind words for anyone else. Asked about his prospects, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said, `` All of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s in flux now that the vice president is in a free fall.'' Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s standing as the clear front-runner among <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> has eroded since his embarrassing third-place finish in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> precinct caucuses on Monday. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> called the upcoming days `` the four most volatile of this campaign.'' Focusing on <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think you can go to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and talk to farmers about how many dollars you've appropriated and then come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and avoid it.'' He also said the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator had told Iowans that he would not pledge to oppose any tax increases and then came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and said he would veto a tax increase. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> voters have a reputation for solid opposition to tax increases. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had supported an import fee on foreign oil in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> but `` in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> he says he'll veto it.'' As for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, a congressman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said, `` He's a big spender. In fact he's got a spending record in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that is even more liberal than <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> -LRB- a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congresswoman from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> -RRB- or <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> -LRB- the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination -RRB-.'' `` So, I do n't think on Tuesday the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> are going to fall for a snow job,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said Friday he was saddened by the violence in this week's local elections that left at least 100 people dead, but he added he was heartened by a heavy voter turnout. In a message released by the official <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> news agency, <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said he was sorry at `` the loss of valuable lives and injuries caused to a number of people in some isolated incidents of violence.'' At least 100 people were killed and hundreds injured in clashes among supporters of rival candidates on Wednesday. The voting was to elect representatives to more than 4,370 village councils. Opposition party leaders <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> have blamed <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> for the violence and accused the government of failure to maintain law and order. The women have led a series of strikes and protests since Nov. 10 to try to oust <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON>, daughter of assassinated president <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujibur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, and Mrs. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, wife of another slain president, have called for general strikes Saturday and Sunday to protest the violence and renew the call for <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s resignation. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> on Friday appealed for `` tolerance and patience'' to make the process of democracy a success. `` The enthusiasm and spontaneous participation of the people in the polls was the manifestation of peoples' firm confidence in the constitutional process and democratic norms,'' <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s statement said. According to government reports, voter turnout was as high as 80 percent in areas where there was no violence. <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> was postponed in at least 2,500 of 21,000 voting centers because of election-day clashes. A new date for polling had not yet been set. The list of successful candidates is expected to be ready in about a week, government officials say. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, 58, assumed power in a bloodless coup in 1982. He won election to the presidency in 1986 in balloting the opposition contends was rigged. In an effort to appease the opposition, he dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and called for new elections Feb. 3. The opposition called for a boycott, contending the balloting would not be free and fair.

<HEAD>Son Challenges Justice Department To Admit It Wrongly Extradited
Father</HEAD>

 The son of a man who lived nearly 40 years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and then died in a <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> prison after being convicted of Nazi war crimes challenged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials Friday to admit they wrongly extradited his father to a communist court. <PERSON> Rad </PERSON> <PERSON> Artukovic </PERSON>, in a 135-page report submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the department used fraudulent evidence to send his father, <PERSON> Andrija </PERSON> <PERSON> Artukovic </PERSON>, to face a `` sham trial'' in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> two years ago. The elder <PERSON> Artukovic </PERSON> died last month at age 88 while awaiting execution in a <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> prison. `` The only way the <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> government could get him was through fraud,'' <PERSON> Artukovic </PERSON> told a news conference before leaving for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to join a federal courthouse vigil in honor of his late father. He said his father has become a hero to people from his native <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, now a part of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Andrija </PERSON> <PERSON> Artukovic </PERSON>, who was a cabinet minister in the Nazi puppet state of <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, was called `` Butcher of the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>'' by the Yugoslav government and accused of ordering the deaths of thousands of people. During his trial, he was described as as overseer of a grisly network of concentration camps. <PERSON> Rad </PERSON> <PERSON> Artukovic </PERSON>, 39, said his father was minister of the interior, had no military responsibilities and ordered no deaths. He said his father was not mentally competent to stand trial. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had declared him senile and legally blind when he was extradited. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division, said a copy of <PERSON> Artukovic </PERSON>'s report had been received by the Office of Special Investigations and was being reviewed by investigators who handle allegations of war crimes. `` He's done a marvelous job of defending his father's reputation, but the matter was dealt with in the courts,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said <PERSON> Artukovic </PERSON> said in the report that both his father's extradition and the trial in <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION> relied mainly on false testimony from <PERSON> Bajro </PERSON> <PERSON> Avdic </PERSON>, a man who claimed to have been a military escort for his father. The report said <PERSON> Avdic </PERSON> was not an escort and was not in the places he claimed to be when atrocities allegedly occurred. It also claims he made up the killings attributed to <PERSON> Artukovic </PERSON>. `` I ask the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to go into court and revoke the order they obtained through fraud,'' <PERSON> Artukovic </PERSON> said, accusing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials of collusion with the communist government in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Artukovic </PERSON> said he hopes for a renunciation of the extradition to invalidate the Yugoslav trial. <PERSON> Artukovic </PERSON> said he and two of his four sisters visited their father during his imprisonment in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> but his mother, <PERSON> Ana </PERSON>, never saw her husband after he was extradited. The family lives in <LOCATION> Seal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. His father for many years had been a bookkeeper for a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> construction company The younger <PERSON> Artukovic </PERSON>, a stock trader, said he worked for two years to research the report on what he said was false evidence against his father and is sending copies to members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> went along with whatever was given it by the <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> government but could not collect enough evidence to deport his father. <PERSON> Artukovic </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> accused his father of war crimes to neutralize him as a Croatian political leader. He said most other members of the Croatian wartime cabinet were executed as war criminals but Allied officials found no evidence against him and he was allowed to live freely in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and later the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Slippery, ice-covered roads and snarled traffic helped four people escape from a man who abducted them at gunpoint and took their cars, police said Friday. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Logansport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, was arraigned on four counts of kidnapping in <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after his arrest in the cases early Friday. He was being held without bond in the <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, police said. He also was wanted in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> on various charges, including assaulting a police officer in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, kidnapping, theft and drug-related charges, said Trooper <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was traveling on foot and was not armed when he was arrested, <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said. Strode said <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quirand </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and a 17-year-old girl from <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, jumped from a northbound car Thursday on Interstate 65 while traffic was slowed past the site of a multi-vehicle car-truck pileup in which one person was killed. They ran to police and said they had been kidnapped. <PERSON> Quirand </PERSON> said he had been kidnapped him and his car taken Wednesday at a <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, grocery store. He told WBKO-TV in Bowling Green that his abductor said he was `` running for his life.'' The juvenile said she and her car were taken Tuesday. The man sped away but crashed the car four miles north of the accident scene, <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said. The man then stopped a pickup truck driven by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Eidson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 18, of Bowling Green, and asked <PERSON> Eidson </PERSON> and his passenger, <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Richardsville </LOCATION>, for a ride to get a wrecker. But when they pulled into a service station, <PERSON> Eidson </PERSON> said, the man pulled out a gun and said: `` I'm in a little trouble with the law. Keep going.'' The man then took the wheel but slid off an icy road into a ditch, <PERSON> Eidson </PERSON> said. The three walked to a house and the man tried to persuade someone there to give him a ride to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, but was turned down, <PERSON> Eidson </PERSON> said. He said the three then went to the home of <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Comer </PERSON>, where the man asked to borrow their tractor to pull the truck out of the ditch. Mrs. <PERSON> Comer </PERSON> refused, <PERSON> Eidson </PERSON> said, and the gunman then demanded her car and ripped a telephone cord out of the wall. `` I told them the keys were in the car,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Comer </PERSON> said. Her car slid off another road, and <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eidson </PERSON> escaped while pushing it out of a ditch, <PERSON> Eidson </PERSON> said. The gunman later wrecked that car and police lost his trail until running across him early Friday about six miles south of Bowling Green, <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said. He had been described by <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> authorities as suicidal and wanting vengeance against police officers, <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eidson </PERSON> said he was afraid during the incident. `` I did n't really know'' what the man would do, he said. `` But he had a gun, you know, and he kept pulling it out.''

Massacre</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court on Friday convicted fugitive guerrilla leader <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> and two of his Palestinian followers in the 1985 grenade and rifle attack that killed 16 people in a crowd of holiday travelers at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s airport. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> and another fugitive, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Hamieda </PERSON>, were sentenced to life in prison. The only defendant in custody, <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, was given a 30-year term. More than 80 people were injured in the Dec. 27, 1985 assault on the check-in counters of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and the Israeli carrier <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Leonardo </LOCATION> da Vinci airport. Four Americans were killed, including an 11-year-old girl on a trip with her family to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> El-Hamieda </PERSON>, described as a top lieutenant in <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, was accused along with <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> of organizing the attack. Neither he nor <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> took part in it. The assault occurred at the same hour as a similar strike at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s airport, also blamed on <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s followers. Four people, including two terrorists and an American, died in the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> attack, and 47 people were injured. Two surviving Palestinian terrorists were convicted of murder by a <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> jury and sentenced to life in prison. The <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> jury of two judges and six civilians apparently heeded a plea for leniency for <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, the only survivor of the four-man commando team. He could be released on parole in a little less than 15 years. Earlier in the day, his court-appointed lawyer said he could not possibly ask for acquittal for the 20-year-old <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, who admitted his guilt. Instead, the lawyer, <PERSON> Epifanio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ales </PERSON>, reread for the jury <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>'s own statements about his childhood in a refugee camp in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, his parents' death in an Israeli bombing and his taking up of arms when he was 10 years old <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> was `` a patriot who wanted a Palestine free of the Israelis,'' <PERSON> Ales </PERSON> said in his plea for mercy. The lawyer asked the jury to remember that Italian courts, for years, were merciful to men who had killed adulterous wives and their lovers under a now vanishing `` crime of honor'' standard. Ales said defending the confessed terrorist was `` an anguished task'' and that it was particularly painful to listen to the testimony of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist about how his daughter, 11-year-old <PERSON> Natasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, died in the gunfire. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, news editor for The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, described in court how he threw himself and the girl to the terminal floor in a futile attempt to shield her from the bullets. According to the trial indictment, four Israeli security guards fired back, killing three of the four members of the attack squad and wounding <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>. The steel-barred holding cage for <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> was empty on Friday. He chose to stay in his prison cell, exercising his right under Italian law not to attend his trial. He only attended court Dec. 15, the trial's opening session. The trial was based largely on hours of pre-trial statements by <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, who told investigators that the terrorists were trained in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and took their orders from headquarters in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the Syrian capital. Investigators believed el-Hamieda provided the terrorists with their weapons and gave them final instructions during several meetings in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, then checked out of a hotel and fled <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> at virtually the same hour the raid was launched. Prosecutor <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Deleo </PERSON> had requested conviction and life sentences for the three defendants, saying <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>'s statements made clear the airport strikes were linked to several terrorist attacks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this decade. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> does not have capital punishment. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group has been blamed for more than 100 attacks across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> since 1972. He split from <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in 1973. An international arrest warrant has been issued for <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> is a nom de guerre which means `` father of the struggle.'' He originally based his group in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> but was expelled and is believed to operate out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, with his followers trained in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Lawyers for both fugitive defendants asked the jury for acquittal for lack of evidence. They said they would appeal the verdict. <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>'s lawyer said he had not yet decided about an appeal. All three defendants were charged with massacre and with illegal possession of arms.

 About 15,000 reservists, civilian militia, police and regular army troops will take part soon in civil defense and military maneuvers, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Barricada announced Friday. <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said the civilians and military personnel will participate in the exercises in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and its surrounding region. It did not specify on what day they would begin. The maneuvers come at a time of high tension in the city of <LOCATION> Masaya </LOCATION>, about 20 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, where demonstrators opposing the government's obligatory military draft clashed with <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> supporters and police on Monday and Tuesday. Club-wielding <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> demonstrators first sought to quash the protests in the streets. Police later intervened to break up the demonstrations, and Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> arrived to monitor the situation. The exercises `` are of a routine nature and are called for under the annual plans to prepare the people in defense,'' <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said. It added that participating Sandinista police would patrol `` centers of greater criminal incidences.'' The Regional Committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the government party, told Barricada the maneuvers would involve peasant militia, factory and neighborhood reservists and mass organizations. Neighborhood <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> organization members also will take part. Sandinista army troops staged maneuvers at the same time last year, but few civilians participated. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> referred indirectly to the <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON> demonstrations Thursday, saying he had instructed Sandinista police to act `` with profound respect for the physical integrity of those who provoke them, but at the same time with energy and without vacillation in order to impede vandalism and disorder in the country.''

<HEAD>Bullfrog County, Population Zero, Is Illegal, Judge Says</HEAD>

 Empty Bullfrog County, created from scrubland in a bid to assure the state of federal dollars should the government build a nuclear dump in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, violates the state constitution, a judge has ruled. Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zenoff </PERSON> said Thursday the county stretched its legal limits `` every which way,'' and left too many constitutional issues `` hanging in the air.'' <LOCATION> Nye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, from which unpopulated <LOCATION> Bullfrog </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was carved, had challenged the 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s creation of the state's 18th county. <PERSON> Zenoff </PERSON>, a former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice brought in to hear the case, issued the ruling after less than 30 minutes of oral arguments in district court. <PERSON> Zenoff </PERSON> said the governor's authority to appoint three commissioners for the county ran `` contrary to the democratic process,'' and contributed to its failure to provide representative government. `` I can not in good conscience uphold this law,'' he said. `` Obviously, we're very pleased,'' said <LOCATION> Nye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON>. `` It confirms what we've been saying all along. As far as I'm concerned, <LOCATION> Bullfrog </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is dead and it should be.'' Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Daykin </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Bullfrog </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said it would be up to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to decide whether to appeal <PERSON> Zenoff </PERSON>'s ruling to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The commission's next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday. `` We usually do n't accept defeat in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>,'' said commission Chairman <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>. Legislators created the county out of a 144-square-mile chunk of <LOCATION> Nye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> as a way of giving the state control over federal funds available for the proposed. <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> is one of three sites under consideration. Had Bullfrog County been selected, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would have had to compensate the state-run county an estimated $ 8 million to $ 25 million a year, officials said. `` Personally, I hope the Legislature does n't appeal it because it's brought enough embarrassment to <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and should be allowed to lay in peace,'' <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> needs to rethink its approach to the problem.'' <LOCATION> Nye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> stands to lose revenue should the new county remain on the books. Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, who signed the law creating the county into effect, issued only a brief statement upon learning of <PERSON> Zenoff </PERSON>'s decision `` This apparently resolves the <LOCATION> Bullfrog </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> issue unless the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> chooses to appeal,'' he said. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zupon </PERSON>, the governor's press secretary, said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> `` has always said he'll abide by the court's decision. He's not a party to the suit and he has n't said anything about whether he thinks it should be appealed.'' <LOCATION> Nye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> challenged the county's creation on 37 different legal grounds in a 92-page brief. Its major complaint was <LOCATION> Bullfrog </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s failure to provide representative government. <PERSON> Zenoff </PERSON> agreed, saying it was not `` answerable to the people.'' Among other things, he said the law made no provisions for a judicial district or legislative representation for the county.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will go to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in two weeks to try to promote two-stage negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> self-rule. A brief <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcement Friday said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would make the trip at the end of the month `` for the purpose of advancing the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process.'' Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said he would set out for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> about 24 hours after returning from Feb. 21-23 talks in <LOCATION> Mosocw </LOCATION> and visit <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and possibly <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plans to remain in the area until he joins President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for a summit meeting with the leaders of the 15 <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> countries in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> beginning March 2. The Soviets have been notified in advance that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> intends to sound out Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> about an international peace conference that would be a backdrop for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations. Their <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> talks will center mostly on prospects for a treaty to sharply reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range nuclear missiles and for a withdrawal of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after an occupation of more than eight years. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> have registered their reluctance to having the Soviets play a prominent role in a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> settlement. But <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> wants the participation of all the big powers, including <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other sources who declined to be identified, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will advance a two-step plan that would open negotiations in April between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a mixed <LOCATION> Jordanian-Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation and then resume in December to work on an overall Middle East settlement. All options, including statehood for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, would be open at that point. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> reaffirmed Monday night in a meeting with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign policy experts that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approach to a final settlement is based on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> trading territory for peace. That could cause severe political problems for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> because many of his supporters are against relinquishing land the Arabs lost to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 Six-Day War. At the same time, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not endorsed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> statehood. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s formula, outlined in a 1982 speech and still <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy, proposed linking the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said flatly that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` will not support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state'' in the territories and would also `` not support annexation or permanent control by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s trip is designed to show a commitment to aiding the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and to ending violence in the Israeli-held territories. Sources said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s overriding goal was to promote negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION>, possibly in the framework of a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace conference. They stressed that the framework was incidental to holding direct talks on the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> issue and that all approaches to getting the two sides to the table would be considered. The peace conference idea has drawn objections from <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, but it has the support of Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, and possibly King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. On his last visit to the region in October, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he understood why <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would be reluctant to hold negotations in a way that gave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a chance to play an influential role. The Soviets generally side with the Arabs in their dispute with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and do not have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. About 96 percent of the residents of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> are Palestinian Arabs. Jewish settlers who were banned from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> during <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s control from 1948 to 1967 have established villages, religious schools and synagogues there. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of being hopelessly one-sided toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But a recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic emissary, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Habib </PERSON>, was reported to have detected a `` positive'' attitude in talks with the king in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> returned from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> on Thursday and reported to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on his meetings with leaders of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, as well as with British and French officials.

<TEXT>
 The Roman Catholic relief agency <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it has raised more than $ 10 million to help the victims of the African drought. The charity said $ 5.5 million of the $ 10.3 million total had been sent to support the people in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre provinces until fall. The organization said in a statement that it raised the money during its `` Drought in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' campaign, and that it was donated by private citizens, workers groups, churches and by religious and public charities. Besides the money already sent, the relief agency has allocated another $ 1.98 million for directing the second phase of its program in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre. It also said it is preparing to send $ 3.4 million for relief efforts in <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The government should ease back on acreage controls for the 1989 wheat crop, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON>, association president, said greater acreage should be permitted so the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can keep filling a growing export demand. For the last two years, wheat farmers have been required to idle 27.5 percent of their base acreage in order to qualify for federal supports. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is to announce the 1989 wheat program by June 1. <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON>, a wheat farmer from <LOCATION> Bayard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, said the association wants the acreage reduction be held to no more than 20 percent. <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpiles are expected to drop by 30 percent this season, the largest annual decline in more than 20 years. A 1989 acreage reduction of less than 20 percent could be justified if <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> maintains its current export subsidy programs, he said. `` Since we do n't know what will happen after the November elections, our market outlook is somewhat cloudy, thus making it more difficult to forecast export sales opportunities,'' <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON> said in a statement.

 A member of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> arrived in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> on Friday to join Palestinian deportees in a planned voyage back to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but two organizers said they still had not obtained a ship. The president of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s main seamen's union, meanwhile, said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents had used threats and pressure to block the PLO-sponsored trip that would carry 130 Palestians deported by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>. Union leader <PERSON> Antonis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalakogiorgis </PERSON> also revealed that the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> had warned they would boycott Greek vessels if Greek seamen continued backing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> effort. The `` journey of return'' is designed to focus attention on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s use of deportations to punish Palestinians in the territories it captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Parliament member <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Miari </PERSON> appeared at a news conference at an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> hotel alongside <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, the chief spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miari </PERSON>, a member of the left-wing Progressive List for Peace, said he was told that `` the Israeli government will put on trial all those who participate in the trip,'' and said there were moves in Parliament to strip him of his parliamentary immunity. Two other parliament members, <PERSON> Tawfiq </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaiad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Biton </PERSON>, were among 11 Israelis who arrived Thursday in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to join the voyage when it stops there. About 20 Israelis plan to make the trip. The trip is modeled after the voyage of the Exodus, which tried to take Jewish refugees to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> in 1947 but was turned back by British authorities. <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Algazi </PERSON>, one of the Israelis who arrived in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> on Thursday, also took part in the Exodus voyage. At the news conference, <PERSON> Miari </PERSON> backed `` the right of the deported Palestinians people to return to their homeland.'' He said he hoped the trip would `` open a new window for just peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' But there was increasing doubt that any ship would be able to sail soon, although the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has gathered hundreds of deportees, observers and journalists in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to take part. Two members of the nine-member voyage steering committee in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> did not have a firm contract to charter a vessel because several companies had backed out of tentative commitments. `` We do n't have a boat yet,'' said <PERSON> Abdul-Jawad </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>, the deported mayor of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION>. `` There is not a concrete ship as of this moment,'' said another member of the steering committee who insisted on anonymity. The voyage was initially scheduled to start on Tuesday, but the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> diplomatic representative in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fouad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Bittar </PERSON>, said Thursday the voyage had been delayed because `` many'' shipowners had backed away from contracts. However, he then promised that the voyage would begin by early Saturday morning from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s main <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> harbor, saying a boat had been found. `` We are still insisting that the boat will sail,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said Friday. He reaffirmed the time schedule given by <PERSON> Bittar </PERSON>, but added an element of uncertainty. `` I'm sure we will find _ and have found, according to Mr. <PERSON> Bittar </PERSON> _ a brave captain'' for the voyage, he said. <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> harbor authority officials said at noon Friday the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had not submitted documents legally required 24 hours before a ship can be brought in or out. <PERSON> Dalakogiorgis </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seamen </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` Israeli agents'' had threatened Greek shipping companies and individual seamen about the voyage. `` Seamen working on ships that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> might have chartered received telephone threats from the Israelis and shipping companies were also under intense pressure from them,'' <PERSON> Dalakogiorgis </PERSON> said. `` I personally received threatening phone calls, threatening my life, not to proceed with this,'' <PERSON> Dalakogiorgis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dalakogiorgis </PERSON> distributed copies of a telex from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> saying `` we would have no choice but to boycott Greek vessels in Israeli ports'' if the voyage goes as planned. No one from the Israeli union, headquartered in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, could be found for comment Friday. Shipping sources in <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the captain of the first ship chartered to make the voyage had also been threatened. They said that <PERSON> Zannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouloumbis </PERSON> of the Maltese-flagged <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> <PERSON> Paloma </PERSON> was warned of an Israeli attack during the voyage and told his life was in danger. The ship's owners, who operate a regular ferry service to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, dropped out.

<HEAD>US Navy Warships Bumped By Soviet Vessels Off Black Sea Coast</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships, under orders to assert international navigation rights, were deliberately bumped by two Soviet warships on Friday after moving within 12 miles of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> coastline, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said No one was injured and damage to the two ships was described as light. But the administration immediately lodged a strong protest with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador here, saying the vessels had done nothing provocative and were operating in accord with international law. `` As Secretary of State -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said just a week ago, we are prepared to deal with the best and worst of Soviet behavior,'' said <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` We intend to continue exercising our rights under international law. The Soviets are obligated to comply with their international commitments.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said during a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing there was no question that the cruiser USS Yorktown and destroyer USS Caron had been struck deliberately by a Soviet frigate and a smaller coastal patrol boat, respectively. The Soviet warships broadcast a warning beforehand, saying they were authorized `` to strike your ship with one of ours,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, a top aide to the chief of naval operations. The two Soviet ships then closed almost simultaneously on the American vessels, `` which were, as we would say in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, shouldered out of the way,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> added. The Yorktown and <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> maintained their course and speed despite the bumping, eventually steaming farther from the Soviet coast, <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. `` The latest report I have now is that both ships are operating routinely in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> as planned,'' he said. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said they could not recall a similar incident of deliberate bumping during operations in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The Soviets strongly protested a similar deployment by the same two ships in March 1986, but did nothing at the time to physically interfere with their passage. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> claimed Friday the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships violated its border, ignored warnings `` and dangerously maneuvered in Soviet territorial waters.'' `` It was a routine passage and we were doing nothing provocative at all ...,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> countered. `` We view -LRB- this -RRB- with considerable concern.'' According to Cmdr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lawyer who appeared with <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, the Yorktown and <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> were operating off the <LOCATION> Crimean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in what the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> calls its `` assertion of rights'' program _ an effort to periodically steam through contested waters to emphasize freedom of navigation on the high seas. Unlike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which claims a three-mile territorial limit, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> claims a 12-mile limit along its coast, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> explained. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will accept such a claim, but any country claiming 12 miles `` must allow for innocent passage by the ships of all nations,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> tries to insist that foreign ships stick to specified sea lanes when making an innocent passage, something it has no right to do, the lawyer said. `` So what our ships were doing there was exercising that right of innocent passage,'' <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> said. He noted that Soviet intelligence-gathering ships routinely operate within five miles of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coastline. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, Friday's incident began with the Yorktown and <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> steaming eastward, parallel to each other and about three miles apart, past the <LOCATION> Crimean </LOCATION> peninsula. The <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> was about seven miles off the shoreline and the Yorktown about 10. The two ships had been shadowed by three Soviet vessels and Soviet reconnaissance aircraft ever since entering the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> through the Turkish Straits on Wednesday. At about 11 a.m. local time Friday _ or 3 a.m. EST _ <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said the Soviets broadcast the following warning to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships: `` Soviet ships have orders to prevent violation of territorial waters. I am authorized to strike your ship with one of ours.'' The <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> responded: `` I am engaged in innocent passage, consistent with international law.'' When neither the <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> or Yorktown changed course, a Krivak-class frigate moved up on the <LOCATION> Yorktown </LOCATION> and a Mirka-class patrol vessel moved on the <PERSON> Caron </PERSON>, `` grazing'' the left sides of the each, <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. American naval forays into the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> _ each of which must be approved by the president _ are normally ordered at least once a year for two reasons, said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials who asked not to be named. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships are expected to monitor Soviet military operations, frequently employing electronic listening gear, and to assert the right of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships to navigate through those waters. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> considers the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> as its own `` lake'' _ even though it is only one of several nations bordering the sea's waters _ and maintains a large naval fleet there According to <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> called in Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> Friday morning to `` lodge a strong protest.'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who is scheduled to meet with his Soviet counterpart next month, also intends to protest the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> action, <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> said.

 The Kremlin accused the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday of spreading `` malicious slanders'' about human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has violations of its own. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> carried an interview with <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Glukhov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in which he discussed the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s annual report on human rights around the world. The report, released Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government gave its people greater freedom and showed more tolerance toward dissenters in 1987. But it said an all-powerful secret police force remained unchecked. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the report `` again contains malicious slanders against the socialist countries, including the U.S.S.R.'' <PERSON> Glukhov </PERSON>, first deputy head of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s Directorate for Humanitarian and Cultural Issues, accused the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of making the allegations to speed up ratification of the intermediate-range nuclear weapons treaty, which is making its way through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the treaty in December. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Glukhov </PERSON> noted, conducted a prison amnesty and introduced new rules on emigration and immigration last year. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ignored these steps and relied on faulty information for its report, he charged. `` Much of the specific information contained in that report is clearly drawn from unclean sources,'' he said, citing what he said was an exaggerated figure of 400 political prisoners in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> `` Obviously, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> again lacks simple objectivity and simple truthfulness in the evaluations,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would like to know why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has political prisoners, sentences minors to death and prosecutes clergymen for anti-war activities, <PERSON> Glukhov </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side is far from the measure of openness and self-criticism demonstrated by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on that issue,'' he said, referring to human rights. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> are to discuss human rights at a meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Feb. 21-23.

<HEAD>White House Sees Progress in Verifying Test-Ban Treaties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Nuclear test-ban negotiations, resuming next week in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, are making progress toward means of verifying two unratified test ban treaties, the White House said Friday. In a statement, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the talks, which begin again Monday, `` represent a practical approach _ as the president has long advocated _ to nuclear testing limitations which are in our national security interest.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed in undertaking the talks that the first step should be to negotiate effective verification measures for the Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. The two pacts, limiting the magnitude of certain nuclear tests, were negotiated in the 1970s, but ratification has been withheld because of concerns about how Soviet compliance could be verified. `` Once our verification concerns have been satisfied and the treaties ratified, we will propose that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> immediately enter into negotiations on ways to implement a step-by-step program _ in association with a program to reduce and ultimately eliminate nuclear weapons _ of limiting and ultimately ending nuclear testing,'' the spokesman said. `` We are making progress toward our goal of effective verification,'' he added. `` With a better understanding of the practical problems associated with conducting these experiments, we now have the information needed to design the experiments,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The two sides have agreed to begin this work immediately upon resumption of negotiations on Monday. We hope that the sides will continue to make expeditious progress in these talks.'' The statement was released as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for a five-day stay.

<HEAD>Robbery Suspect Was Shot 13 Times; Listed February Goal Of `Get

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prison escapee who robbed a credit union and then killed a policeman during a chase was shot 13 times by officers after his escape was blocked by a television station's helicopter, authorities say Police also said the man, <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, had listed his goals for February, and at the top of the list was penciled: `` Get Money.'' <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> robbed the credit union Tuesday and during the ensuing police chase he ran over and killed Detective <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>, 51. After running into a tree, he took <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurienti </PERSON> hostage and forced him to drive him in his pickup truck. A <ORGANIZATION> KCNC-TV </ORGANIZATION> helicopter piloted by <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> followed <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> and blocked his escape in a parking lot, and officers shot him to death in the truck cab. <PERSON> Laurienti </PERSON> escaped injury except for a cut from flying glass. The chase and the final confrontation were videotaped by a cameraman riding with <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> said that because of the many entrance and exit wounds on <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>'s body, investigators had difficulty telling how many times he had been shot. `` But my guess is 13 times,'' he said Thursday. According to authorities, <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> was a Marine deserter with a long criminal record, including escape, robbery, forgery and the ransom kidnapping of a 13-year-old boy, who escaped unharmed. He escaped from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' Ferguson prison unit in September 1984 and was recaptured four months later. In July, while serving a life sentence for aggravated robbery and other charges, <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> hot-wired a truck and drove it through a prison fence. He had eluded authorities since then. <PERSON> Stoll </PERSON> said police found the list of goals among piles of papers in <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>'s mountain home near <LOCATION> Bailey </LOCATION>. He was known to write detailed strategies and contingency plans in advance of his crimes, but investigators have not found plans for Tuesday's credit union office robbery, which netted $ 3,000. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Laurienti </PERSON>, 73, was given a new truck Friday to replace the one damaged in the gun battle. The truck was purchased for him by a dealership and <ORGANIZATION> KCNC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Laurienti </PERSON> had refused to obey <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>'s order to ram the station's helicopter after <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> landed in front of them. <PERSON> Laurienti </PERSON> embraced <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> when they met for the first time Friday, and they discussed Tuesday's ordeal. `` God bless this guy,'' <PERSON> Laurienti </PERSON> said. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> -RRB- could have blew my brains out, but I was n't going to ram this guy.''

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s presidential campaign is wasting no time in trying to lure national convention delegates away from Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, even though only a handful have been chosen so far. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> campaign has gone to work on at least some of the 18 delegates who were chosen there last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and so far one delegate has been enticed to defect while another is complaining of being harassed. `` They're after me,'' <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesberger </PERSON> said Friday in a telephone interview from from <LOCATION> Ridgway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` I'm just getting a little miffed that people are trying to pressure me.'' The effort has intensified since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s third-place finish in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, but <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Shane </PERSON>, who leads <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> campaign, said nobody's trying to twist arms. Since <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, `` we're getting calls from people rethinking their positions,'' he said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jesberger </PERSON> had been persuaded to switch support to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader, but <PERSON> Jesberger </PERSON> herself said that's not true. <PERSON> Jesberger </PERSON> said she has often indicated that she `` has no problems with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>.'' But she said she was sticking with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at least for now, because he is the best qualified candidate. However, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s campaign did succeed in winning over <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, an insurance adjuster from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> who was a member of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s state steering committee. <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> did not return calls to his office or home Friday, but he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he left the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign in part because it was not paying enough attention to black Republicans. His defection brought the national delegate count to 46 for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 35 for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has 32 delegates, former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> 8 and another 8 remain uncommitted. There are still 2,148 Republican delegates to be chosen.

<HEAD>Ferraro Says Women's Equality Depends On More Female Officeholders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, whose vice presidential nomination marked a peak for the women's equality movement, said Friday that women must translate their increasing power at the ballot box to campaigns for elective office. `` If you do n't run, you ca n't win,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said. `` And just as important, every time a woman runs, women win.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> addressed some 1,500 women attending a symposium on women and the Constitution convened by former first ladies <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and Lady <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. She said there are more female officeholders than ever, but the numbers are not representative of the population. `` Women are, by any measure, grossly underrepresented in elective office,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said. `` I would say shockingly underrepresented; however, nobody is shocked. That's simply how it is.'' <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, wife of slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, echoed Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> in urging women, particularly black women, to seek office. `` We have a strength and tenacity and a gift for nurturing and compassion which has been finely honed and tempered in our struggle to raise families in a sexist society,'' Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said on the closing day of the two-day symposium. `` Let me put it this way _ if the women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> do n't lead the struggle against poverty, racism and militarism, then we must ask, who will?'' she said. According to the National Women's Political Caucus, in 1987 women held 14 percent of the higher statewide elective offices in the country. At the same time, there are only 23 women serving in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ and only one black woman _ two female governors and two women in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, a former congresswoman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said many of those officeholders are not yet in positions of national power or leadership, which she said would likely delay nomination of a woman as a presidential candidate. However, more women will become interested in politics and the numbers elected will increase, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said her 1984 campaign with Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> inspired thousands of women to write her and describe how the candidacy inspired them to go to law school, medical school, or run for office. `` Every time a woman runs for any elective office, it's like throwing a stone in a lake,'' she said. `` The ripple effect is felt far beyond the immediate point of impact.'' Mrs. King compared the challenge facing women in the workplace and in politics to that faced by blacks during the civil rights struggle led by her late husband. She said women can learn much from the tactics used by blacks to gain rights. `` The movement showed millions of Americans that you can, indeed you must, defy authority when that authority is in the wrong,'' Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. Women have become a distinct and powerful voting group in recent years, Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said, pointing to the 1986 mid-term elections that brought a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> majority to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. She said nine Democrats won by getting less than 50 percent of the male vote, and more than 50 percent of the female vote. `` Women voted more strongly Democratic, and on key issues like peace, disarmament, social welfare and the environment, differently from men,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said that after she was nominated for vice president during the 1984 Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the thousands of joyfully weeping women she saw told her that equality, and a female president, are coming. `` She will have shown that she possesses the rare combination of qualities the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people look for in a president, and then it will be time. And tears will be cried like you would n't believe,'' she said.

 Six people have been arrested in what federal officials say is an international counterfeiting scheme involving thousands of bogus $ 100 bills, and investigators are trying to determine whether the phony money came from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The arrests began after an <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Khoury </PERSON>, 25, was taken into custody by <LOCATION> Creston </LOCATION> police and federal agents following a tip that suspect bills had been received by a grocery and department store in <LOCATION> Creston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> El-Khoury </PERSON> was charged with passing and possessing phony <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money. Federal officials said he had several counterfeit $ 100 bills in his possession when he was arrested. Also arrested during the month-long investigation was <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>, 29, who played football for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> from 1977 to 1980. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>, who has been working for the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, was a seventh-round draft choice of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jets </ORGANIZATION> professional football team in 1981. He was charged with possessing counterfeit money. Also charged were <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Habhab </PERSON>, 28, a disc jockey at an Ames nightclub; his roommate, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sejaan </PERSON>, 26, a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> citizen and <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> student; and two other students, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahrenfuss </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>, 29. <PERSON> Habhab </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sejaan </PERSON> pleaded guilty Thursday to charges of possessing counterfeit $ 100 bills.

He said investigators are trying to determine whether the money came from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Documents filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> as part of the guilty pleas by <PERSON> Habhab </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sejaan </PERSON> include an account of <PERSON> Sejaan </PERSON>'s conversation last year with two <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION> men in which they discussed the possible sale of bogus <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency <PERSON> Sejaan </PERSON> said he talked to <PERSON> El-Khoury </PERSON> because he knew <PERSON> El-Khoury </PERSON> needed money to stay in school. <PERSON> El-Khoury </PERSON> told him to get $ 5,000 in counterfeit money from one of the Cedar Rapids men, and on Jan. 11 <PERSON> Sejaan </PERSON> met him in the parking lot of a restaurant, according to the document. The man told Sejaan he was giving him $ 16,000 worth of counterfeit money and wanted 45 percent of the proceeds from the sale. The man also said he expected another shipment of $ 200,000 in phony money at the end of January. <PERSON> Sejaan </PERSON> said he gave <PERSON> El-Khoury </PERSON> 10 $ 100 counterfeit bills and was paid $ 405. He later gave <PERSON> El-Khoury </PERSON> 20 more phony bills and gave <PERSON> Habhab </PERSON>, his roommate, 50 of them, according to the documents. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teig </PERSON> of Cedar Rapids would not comment on the allegations against the Cedar Rapids men.

 Democrat <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, campaigning with country music star <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> on Friday, cited increased violence and suicide among children as he defended his wife's efforts against raw music lyrics. `` What she has said is parents should be more aware that younger and younger children are targets of increasingly brutal and explicit material,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. Cash, a country performer for more than 30 years, appeared with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> at a small rally in the railroad yard of the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and planned to travel with the Democratic presidential candidate to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. But snow in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> forced <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and Cash to abandon those plans and return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to await better weather. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who has campaigned less in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> than most of his rivals while concentrating on the Southern primaries, hoped to make it to that state before Saturday's Democratic debate. Cash, wearing his trademark black-only attire, enthusiastically endorsed <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and said his fellow Tennesseean was the only presidential candidate he has ever publicly backed. `` You know, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has a strong, energetic man,'' Cash told about 150 people who stood in sub-freezing temperatures. `` What we need is a strong, energetic, young, brilliant man, and that's what we have in <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>.'' Cash's presence prompted numerous questions at a later news conference about <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Tipper </PERSON>'s work against sexual and violent lyrics in rock music. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> responded by saying there were epidemics of teen pregnancy and suicide and an `` epidemic of violence by children against children.'' `` In the face of that, I think it's legitimate to ask what is the effect of children seeing 18,000 murders on television by the time they graduate from high school. What is the effect of increasingly explicit material on younger and younger children,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` I'm very proud of what she has done.'' He said she has never sought to impose censorship but favors voluntary efforts aimed at letting parents know what is contained in the music their children listen to. <PERSON> Tipper </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s well-publicized efforts in that cause have brought criticism from some in the entertainment industry. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s poll takers and strategists say they find little opposition to his candidacy in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> or elsewhere based on his wife. Cash said he saw no point in trying to censor what his child might hear in music, but added, `` I really do n't think that <PERSON> Tipper </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is advocating that kind of censorship anyway.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> did not accompany her husband but two of their children, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, age 5, and <PERSON> Karenna </PERSON>, 14, traveled with him. As <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and Cash spoke, <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> Southern freight trains rolled by noisily just a short distance away, prompting <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> to call on Cash to sing `` a train song.'' Cash, a country music performer for more than three decades, complied. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s attorney general, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who is expected to run for governor next year, appeared with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, as did the district's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Olin </PERSON>, and the city's Republican Mayor <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> blasted President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for a lack of leadership on the deficit and the economy. He said that after the stock market drop last October <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had nothing of substance to say. `` The president came out of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and said, ` What?' _ the helicopter engines were going, you know. He said, ` They tell me I've got to go,''' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` Well, he's got a point there.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, pinning his presidential hopes on the Southern primaries on March 8, contended that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is unlikely to gain great momentum out of an expected win in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, before the campaign turns South. `` It's essentially a two-person race in most of the South,'' he said, referring to himself and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.

According to <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Breece </PERSON>, an investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>, the couple allegedly tried to arrange the killings to erase the embarrassment from <PERSON> Rhana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON>'s elopement with her Syrian cousin in 1984. `` This would not only help them save face, but elevate the standing of the family in the tribe to an even higher level than it was before the daughter ran away,'' <PERSON> Breece </PERSON> said. The lovers fled from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and eventually moved to <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Police were contacted by a private investigator the Tarawnehs allegedly asked either to commit the murders himself or arrange for a hitman. <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON> and his wife were each charged with three counts of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and three counts of solicitation to commit first-degree murder. The alleged intended targets were their unwanted son-in-law, <PERSON> Mouataz </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdulsamad </PERSON>, 29; his younger sister, <PERSON> Azza </PERSON>; and his mother, <PERSON> Najwa </PERSON>, 45. When <PERSON> Rhana </PERSON> first fled <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> with her new husband, the family wanted to send her back and sell her into a prostitution ring, authorities said. But as the embarrassment to the family grew deeper, the parents allegedly tried to set up the killings of her new husband and his relatives. The plans included instructions for the killer to to hang all three people, take photographs of the bodies, then cut the mother's tongue out and sexually mutilate the husband and his sister, <PERSON> Breece </PERSON> said Instructions were also included on packaging the body parts in formaldehyde for shipment to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Breece </PERSON> would not disclose the amount the couple allegedly agreed to pay for the murders. An investigator the parents allegedly tried to hire in early January told authorities about the plot, and agreed to cooperate with the state in its criminal investigation, <PERSON> Breece </PERSON> said. After getting court permission for wiretaps, agents taped phone conversations between the investigator and the family, <PERSON> Breece </PERSON> said. A state agent and the investigator, who acted as a middle man for a non-existent hitman, met with the doctor and his wife in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> on Feb. 2, <PERSON> Breece </PERSON> said. On Wednesday, the father `` was told the the murders had been committed and to send his money,'' <PERSON> Breece </PERSON> said. `` Whether or not he did -LRB- send the money -RRB-, I do n't know.'' <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> continued the case until Saturday because the <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, was out of town. The couple faces extradition to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Breece </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A joyrider who took four late-model cars and trucks this week has earned the grudging respect of <PERSON> Beckley </PERSON>'s finest The joyrider was brazen, bold, efficient and 11 years old. `` I've never seen anything like it,'' said Patrolman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>. `` He stole them like a pro.'' Like many professionals, the young suspect was a specialist. All four of the stolen vehicles _ two Chevrolets, a GMC and a <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> _ were <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> products. `` He said they were the easiest to steal,'' <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said. The technique in each theft was the same, he said. The boy broke the door locks, then broke into the steering column to defeat the locking mechanism. `` Then he'd just start them up and drive off, and all this in a matter of seconds,'' <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said. In quick succession Wednesday night, police found two vehicles taken from a shopping center, one from a mine service company and a fourth from a home. `` We'd find one of the missing cars, and another one would turn up nearby,'' <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said. `` It looks like he just drove them around, parked them, cranked up another one, and took off.'' Investigators found the boy through a combination of forensic evidence and a tip from a witness who saw the suspect near one of the vehicles. `` I was taking fingerprints off of one of the Blazers and noticed they seemed awfully small,'' <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said. `` We started checking, and every one of the seats was pushed up as far as it would go.'' Officials contacted the nearest elementary school, described the suspect and principal <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Peelish </PERSON> led them to the boy. `` I called his grandmother, and she gave her permission for him to talk to the police,'' <PERSON> Peelish </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peelish </PERSON> said the youth transferred to the school recently after moving from another state and had not been a difficult student. `` A kid's a kid, and they all get a little rowdy, but we've really had no problems with him,'' he said <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said the boy admitted stealing the cars, and gave police several tips on his methods. The boy was released in his grandmother's custody pending juvenile court action. He is charged with four counts of auto theft, and one count of grand larceny for removing a stereo from one of the vehicles.

<HEAD>Researchers Use Monkeys In Vision Research</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researchers have fitted monkeys with contact lenses in a study that they hope could yield new ways to treat babies born with cataracts and other vision disabilities. The study at the <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> involves a pediatric ophthalmologist, a primate behavioral psychologist, neuroscientists and several dozen monkeys. In the experiments, rhesus monkeys undergo lens-removal surgery to simulate the operation performed on a newborn with cataracts, the cloudiness of the eye lens that often plagues older adults. Such cataract surgery is not new. In most cases, when a lens is removed, the patient can be fitted with corrective contact lenses or glasses. But the surgery poses special problems in young children, because humans are born without fully developed vision systems; the eyes and the brain must learn to work together. If deprived of normal visual stimulation _ such as by cataracts _ special cells needed for vision fail to mature properly. Cataract surgery must be performed in children at a very early age. Even so, doctors have had poor results in trying to stimulate development. Despite corrective lenses, the best most children have achieved has been 20-40 vision. In the experiment, the researchers remove a healthy lens from one eye of each monkey. They fit them with contact lenses made at the center's lab and try various treatment to prompt successful vision development. `` Hopefully, we'll be able to relate these results to the human child,'' Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Boothe </PERSON>, the ophthalmologist and behaviorist who heads the two-year-old study, said in an interview Friday. In both monkeys and man, patients with one good eye and one bad one will rely on the good eye. `` If a child's left to his own devices, he'll ignore it -LRB- the damaged eye -RRB-,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON>, a pediatric ophthalmologist from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who is working with the <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> primate researchers. `` We want to force usage of the cataract eye.'' To force use of the weaker eye, a child can be fitted with a patch over the good eye. Monkeys do n't like to wear eye patches, so the <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> monkeys are fitted with a black contact lens over their good eye. In either case, stimulating proper vision development in the bad eye is not as simple as just blocking the good one, <ORGANIZATION> Eggers </ORGANIZATION> said. If worn too little, a patch will leave the patient relying on the good eye; too long, and vision in the patched eye will deteriorate. Doctors are unsure how long the patches or black lenses should be worn to give each eye the proper visual stimulation, <ORGANIZATION> Eggers </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We do n't know the best method, and we obviously can not experiment with children.'' To solve the problem, <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> researchers are using different lens routines on different monkeys. Some wear a black contact lens all the time, some never do, and others wear it for different intervals. Researchers check the study's remaining 20 monkeys every two hours to make sure they have n't lost their lenses. `` They have a great ability to rub contact lenses out,'' <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON> said. Lost lenses are quickly replaced. Researchers test the monkeys' vision, in part, by showing them patterns on a video screen and rewarding them with banana pellets when they recognize the proper pattern _ thus proving their vision is working. After the lens trials, the monkeys are killed so researchers can examine their brains and the development of their optical nerve systems, <PERSON> Boothe </PERSON> said.

 Here is the text of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s statement Friday announcing his withdrawal from the Republican presidential race.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 It's evident to me that the contest in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and my own assessment of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, make it clear that <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> will not be the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate in 1988. My choice, therefore, is to work as effectively as I can for the principles and the policies that led me into the race in the first place. I'm therefore announcing today my withdrawal as a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination and my support for the candidate best qualified to lead this nation. To my family, my friends, and my supporters, let me express my enduring gratitude for the devotion and your help throughout this campaign. Only in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could a non-politician have achieved even as much as I have. Even though I was the darkest of the dark horses, you supported me because you and I believe, at the very least, we could shape the issues in this campaign. Believe me, we've done that. To my fellow Republicans, and to my fellow Americans, let me say this. The'88 elections should not be about business as usual in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Our next president should not be a man who offers simply more of the same. We need a leader who truly reflects the mainstream values that made this country great, including hard work, moral convictions, and tolerance for the diversity of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We should have the experience and the skill that comes from a record of having made a difference. And our next president should understand that good government means competent government run by the very best people <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can provide. In my judgment, Senator <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is the candidate best able to lead our country into the'90s. He has risen from among the people through hard work and honest effort. He has never forgotten that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is, above all, the adventure of the common man. And he knows from experience how to make our government work. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has indeed made a difference. As a candidate in this campaign, only <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> embodies best my understanding of the crucial challenges we face and what we must do to meet them. He knows, and I agree, that we must tackle the horrendous budget deficit now, without resorting to short-term gimmicks or destructive tax increases that would cripple our nation's economy. He knows, and I agree, that the answer to our trade policy must not be self-defeating protectionism. He knows, and I agree, that in dealing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> we must give <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> no choice but restraint. And, above all, it is very clear to me that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has the strength of character a president must have to deal with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. I am proud to offer my support for <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. I urge each of my supporters and all Republicans to vote for <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in this crucial <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary and every primary thereafter. The party needs <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>; so does <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Now, finally, a word about that unique American institution, the media. Every candidate for a high public office undergoes the most searching scrutiny from the media. They were fair to me. I hope you feel I was fair to you.

 Near blizzard conditions disrupted presidential campaigns and almost brought the state to a halt Friday with up to two feet of snow predicted and winds gusting to 60 mph. `` It's terrible out there,'' state police dispatcher <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilaire </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundstedt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> added, `` It's not a day to go out and challenge the storm.''

Staff members scrambled to revise schedules as most candidates had to scrap events. Several were having trouble flying in or out of the state, with airports closed. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had planned to travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had hoped to go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s boyhood home, high school and the railroad depot that served as his 1976 campaign headquarters are centerpieces of a project to turn his hometown into a major tourist attraction. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will assume responsibility for preserving the <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Site </ORGANIZATION> during a dedication ceremony at the depot on Saturday morning. Those scheduled to attend include <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, former officials of his administration and members of the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> congressional delegation. About 80,000 visitors a year stop at the small welcome center in <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, an agricultural community of 650 residents in the heart of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s peanut belt. That is down considerably from the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visited <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> annually during <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s presidency. But in four or five years, after the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has built exhibits, rehabilitated buildings and made other improvements, the town could attract up to 300,000 visitors a year, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who will manage the Carter site in addition to his duties as superintendent of the nearby Andersonville National Historic Site. `` There will be a lot people can see and do,'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. `` I think it'll be a lot more attractive to the people going up and down I-75.'' The popularity of the 39th president's hometown will help the surrounding area, he said. `` One of the primary benefits ... would be in the area of tourism,'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. `` That'll be a tremendous economic benefit to <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and southwest <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Dec. 23 signed legislation authorizing the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to acquire <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s home on the town's main street, his boyhood home on the outskirts of town, a vacant brick building where he attended high school and the depot, which houses a Carter museum. Eventually, the <ORGANIZATION> Carters </ORGANIZATION> will donate their home and its furnishings to the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, but they will occupy the house for their lifetimes. The Carter home, ringed by a metal fence and protected by <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents, will be closed to the public for now. Deeds for the railroad depot and high school will be transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> during Saturday's ceremony. In addition to the historic site, the federal legislation also establishes a 730-acre <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> that includes the town and some surrounding areas.

 A congressional critic of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy said Friday the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> may have left a loophole in a directive barring government officials from aiding private fund-raising efforts for the Nicaraguan Contras `` I was disturbed to learn ... that the White House instructions may not apply to all executive branch employees,'' Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., the chief deputy <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> whip, wrote in a letter to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> on Wednesday issued a memorandum directing that `` no administration official should provide assistance or encouragement of any kind'' to such fund-raising efforts. But <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> said the memo was addressed only to <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff members, and not to officials of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the White House intentionally excepted the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and State departments, they are laying the groundwork for another Iran-Contra scandal,'' <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> said in a statement. During last summer's congerssional hearings into the Iran-Contra arms and money affair, activities by White House and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials to raise money for the Contras, including those of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, became a focus of concern over the `` privatization'' of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy. In the memo, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said `` no administration official should take a position for or against private support for the democratic resistance'' and that officials should discourage discussions of the subject at meetings where they are present. Contra leaders have said they were actively seeking private monetary support. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declined an invitation from congressional leaders to participate in the drafting of a package of strictly `` humanitarian'' aid to the Contras to take the place of the $ 36 million administration package, which included military aid, killed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 4. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders had written <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday to ask for his suggestions, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wrote back Thursday that he would not offer ideas, but only react to any proposal <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might draft. `` The outlines of an acceptable package must provide sufficient aid to sustain the freedom fighters in order to maintain those pressures that have moved the peace process forward,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wrote. The statement seemed a clear indication that the administration will insist on aid that would keep the rebels active as a fighting force. `` Without immediate action by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the freedom fighters will become recklessly exposed, and may soon have to make irreversible decisions about their own future,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the letter. `` Even as I write this letter, we have reliable reports of new Soviet military shipments to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' Current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for the rebels, including authority for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to make air drops to fighters in the field inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, ends Feb. 29. In a speech Thursday night to a conservative political group, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vowed that `` the curtain has n't fallen'' on aid to the rebels. `` We're not giving up on those who are fighting for their freedom, and they are n't giving up either,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Asked Friday what the administration intends to do, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` If we ca n't reach an agreement -LRB- with the Democrats -RRB-, we will have our own package.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said no decision has been made whether an administration package would contain military aid, adding, `` First of all, we want to see what the speaker -LRB- <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> -RRB- produces.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that by the end of February there will be another vote in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on aid _ either the Democratic plan or an administration package.

 An airline passenger with a beef over a bunless hamburger threw his plate and eating utensils at a flight attendant who was unable to placate him with a First Class roll, an airline official said Friday. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was booked for investigation of misdemeanor battery when <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 209 from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> landed at 10:15 p.m. Thursday at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. He was freed after posting bail of $ 500. <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> was one of 50 people aboard the DC-10 who had ordered a special meal, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>, a spokesman for American, based in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` He had ordered a hamburger. For some reason, the hamburger did not have a bun with it. He became somewhat unhappy with that fact. Our people notified the lead flight attendant who did obtain a roll from the First Class section, thinking that might placate him. It did not,'' <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>' wife, who flew with him on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> flight, ordered the same special meal, <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. `` Her hamburger, in fact, did have a bun,'' <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. When the proffered roll failed to satisfy <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>, chief flight attendant <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Roen </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, advised the captain of the problem. He `` told her to read him that portion of the law outlining passenger misconduct,'' <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. She did, but that only appeared to make the passenger angrier, <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. `` After using profanities, he picked up his plate with the knife and fork still on it and threw it at her -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Roen </PERSON> -RRB-, hitting her and narrowly missing a passenger with the flying knife,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arreola </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Roen </PERSON> was uninjured and none of the passengers around <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> was hurt, <PERSON> Arreola </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> was placed under citizen's arrest by Ms. <PERSON> Roen </PERSON> after she was struck by the plate. The captain contacted <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and asked that police stand by, <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. `` Interference with a flight crew is a federal offense and we always prosecute. That will be the case here, too,'' <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> was unsure how many passengers were aboard the flight and did n't know what the menu item was for passengers who had made no special requests.

<TEXT>
 Three Eastern European countries have begun talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> aircraft companies to supply long-range passenger planes to replace aging Soviet equipment in their national airlines, Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, just back from a two-week trip to four Soviet-bloc countries, told reporters `` my impression is they are very much interested in buying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes. It's a significant thing, psychologically, I believe _ Eastern European countries flying <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. planes.'' He declined to identify the countries that expressed interest, but another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. If deals are arranged it would be the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft sales to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. In the early 1970s, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> purchased several <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 passenger jets under a contract arranged at a time when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was wooing <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in hopes of increasing that country's independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said that from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s viewpoint, `` it would be feasible and desirable'' for the sales, but he noted two major stumbling blocks. Buying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft would require large expenditures by the governments and credits from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Export-Import </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> for the purchases would not be available, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. The aircraft companies, moreover, would be prohibited from selling equipment on a list of military-applicable goods banned for export to communist countries. This could limit the type of airplanes the countries could buy. `` There is some navigational equipment that could not be on the planes,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. `` They would have to buy stuff that would not be on the -LRB- embargo -RRB- list.'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, the No. 2 official in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, has assumed special responsibility for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to gain influence in countries that have been dominated by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since World War II. Under the policy, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has offered the nations increased trade and better relations in general, in return for improved human rights performance and the institution of free economic policies. On his latest trip, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said he told Romanian leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> that his country is in danger of losing special trading rights granted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> each year to reward <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for its relatively free emigration policies. The trading rights _ most-favored-nation status _ have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in previous years, but renewal for 1988 has been suspended by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because the <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> government's human rights policies are considered repressive, especially toward religious minorities. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said he told the Romanian leader there was only a `` 50-50 chance it would be renewed, but there was still time.'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, in keeping with previous discussions with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, refused to discuss the human rights issues on grounds they were strictly an internal matter, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. `` I came home with not much reason to hope there will be improvement,'' he said.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Friday his coalition partner and rival, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, was going behind his back in an effort to sabotage <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s strategy for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. His accusation came the day after <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> suggested that intransigence by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> thwarted talks with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, which the foreign minister said could have averted Palestinian riots in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. At the center of the argument over peace is an initiative by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Thursday to say he will visit the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> after his scheduled Feb. 21-23 trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> outlined the new American ideas to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s coalition government this week. According to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials, the plan calls for an international conference, possibly in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, as a means of beginning Arab-Israeli talks by April. Negotiations would focus first on a temporary autonomy plan for the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied territories. Talks on the final status of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> would begin by December even if self-government had not begun. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> immediately endorsed the proposals, but <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said clarifications were needed, and expressed reservations about the rapid timetable and international role. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> leads the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> head the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. On <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio Thursday, the prime minister expressed frustration over what called leaks intended to undercut his negotiating position. `` Every expression of cooperation on my part is thrown in my face immediately,'' he said. `` I show Mr. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> a letter and after a few hours it is in the hands of all the reporters. `` Everything he does is in the middle of the night. What I do he wants to know about so that he can sabotage it.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of surrendering to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> demands for the return of land captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. `` How can you conduct negotiations together when your partner runs every day and every minute to the other side and says, ` Do n't listen to what <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> says, I'll sell it to you cheaper?' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> declared. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s claim that <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was `` overeager'' to accept the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals. `` We are not being overeager. The prime minister is trying to give an excuse for a period of no movement,'' he said. In a speech to party members Thursday night, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> indirectly accused <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of blocking an international conference agreed to by <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. `` If the negotiations with an international opening had begun in April, when they could have been started, would or would it not have spared us the events in the territories?'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. Riots began Dec. 8 and more than 50 Arabs have been killed, nearly all of them by Israelis, accurding to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said: `` It's not a question of intransigence, of a refusal to talk about it, but I do n't want to make the American government fail. `` If we come today with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and the other Arabs, and try to negotiate about the final status, the negotiations will explode immediately. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will say, ` We want Israeli sovereignty.' The other side will say, ` We want Arab sovereignty' and it is finished ... It will be over before it starts.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said a five-year period was needed between Palestinian autonomy and talks about a final settlement so confidence and trust could be built. He said that was the concept in the 1978 Camp David accords, which led to the peace treaty with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in March 1979. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> sent a letter to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Wednesday requesting changes in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal, but <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> refused. It said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> asked the Americans to drop the international conference, extend the autonomy timetable and not to set a date for talks about the final status of the occupied territories. The prime minister also asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to enlist the support of other countries for building urban neighborhoods to house the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Palestinian refugees, repoort said.

<HEAD>Additions To Endangered Species List Hit Near Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> added 59 species to the list of endangered and threatened species last year, the second highest total ever, the service said Thursday. In the previous most active year, 1979, 68 species were added. The list now stands at 993 animals and plants, of which 513 are found only in foreign countries, the service said in a year-end report. One species was removed from the list after confirmation of its long-suspected extinction _ the <LOCATION> Amistad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> gambusia </LOCATION>, a small fish found in some springs in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Another species died out during the year, but the paperwork to remove it from the list has not been completed, spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> said. This was the dusky seaside sparrow, whose last survivor, an elderly male in captivity, died in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Among other reasons to call it a good year, the service noted its reestablishment of the red wolf in the wild in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the growth of the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> bald eagle population from 136 pairs to 161, successful captive breeding of the black-footed ferret and establishment of a second population of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sea otters off the coast near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Too late to make the report was the successful mating of condors in captivity in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The service removed the last condor from the wild last year on Easter Sunday, and hopes to rebuild the population through breeding in captivity. Environmentalists have complained that under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the service has been moving far too slowly in making decisions, and that it will take 16 years or so to work through the backlog of about 1,000 candidate species. They have said that in the last 20 years, 300 species became extinct while waiting for a decision. Listing of a species as threatened or endangered under the 1973 Endangered Species Act means federal agencies must consult the service about any of their activities which could harm it. Also, the service must draft and try to carry out a recovery plan, of which 222 are in effect.

 A research satellite launched last week to test elements of the proposed `` Star Wars'' anti-missile shield failed in a secondary tracking excercise when an optical sensor gave false data to two on-board computers, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday. Air Force Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Otten </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>'s kinetic energy office, said an optical sensor on <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 181, a satellite used to test `` Star Wars'' sensors and trackers, gave flawed data when it tried to track target objects that were beyond its range. <PERSON> Otten </PERSON> said the sensor data went into the computers, causing them to respond inappropriately. He said the flaw was detected within an hour and the computers were told to ignore the data. This corrected the problem. Some of the test data on the system was lost because of the problem, but <PERSON> Otten </PERSON> said the loss was minor because the tracking exercise was a secondary objective. `` In the fundamental mission we suceeded,'' he said. Delta 181 was launched Feb. 8 from the Kennedy Space Center and spent 12 hours conducting a series of tests to gather data needed to refine the SDI, or `` Star Wars,'' anti-missile system. Program manager <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> last week called the flight `` a very successful mission.'' However, Aviation Week and Space Technology, in a story prepared for Monday publication, said the satellite was unable to complete `` battle management fire control computations.'' The magazine blamed the problem on the computers, but <PERSON> Otten </PERSON> said the flaw actually was caused by the optical sensor attempting to lock onto an object beyond its range. Sensors on the satellite were used to track 14 sub-satellite targets released in two groups from the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Otten </PERSON> said the problem developed when the optical sensor located an object, looked away, and then tried to relocate the original object. By then, the target had moved beyond the range of the sensor. The tracking test using the optical sensor was halted when the fuel budgeted for that exercise became exhausted, <PERSON> Otten </PERSON> said. He said an infrared sensor also failed to function properly, but infrared data was collected by a back-up system. <PERSON> Otten </PERSON> said only about three percent of the data collected during the 12-hour mission of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 181 has been examined.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday minimized a report that more than 500 instances of possible wrongdoing by <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> guards at embassies worldwide had not been investigated properly. `` Many of the so-called ` infractions' were very minor, such as curfew violations, insubordination, and misuse of telephone that could have no conceivable tie to suspected <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> activity,'' the corps said in a statement. The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> is the Soviet spy agency. Both agencies responded to Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mica </PERSON>'s statement that more than 500 reports of infractions by Marines at embassies had remained in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s files until recently. <PERSON> Mica </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said the reports, which dealt with black market activities or fraternization with Soviets, are supposed to be turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for further investigation <PERSON> Mica </PERSON> said his information came from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the congressional watchdog agency, which began looking into security at the embassies in the wake of allegations of espionage at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy. The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> often encourages people to engage in illegal behavior as a first step to gaining cooperation with the Soviets, <PERSON> Mica </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition he remain anonymous, said the decision to turn over information about a possible violation by a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> guard is sometimes made by the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, sometimes by the department. `` There have been instances where one or both passed'' along information to the <LOCATION> NIS </LOCATION>, the official said. The removal of a Marine is also a joint decision, he said. Asked about the 578 reports referred to by <PERSON> Mica </PERSON>, the corps said, `` The report is actually a listing of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> security guards whose tours of duty as embassy guards were cut short for a variety of reasons during the period 1980-1987.'' Some Marines were removed for disciplinary reasons; others for medical reasons or for giving a substandard performance, the statement said. Of the security guards sent home between 1985-1987 `` only a handful could be said to relate to espionage.'' During that period, only one Marine, Sgt. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonetree </PERSON>, has been convicted of espionage for his activities in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Marines said they had not known about the list of 578 until June 1987 `` when it surfaced at the Department of State.'' <PERSON> Mica </PERSON> was not available to comment because he is in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> preparing to announce his candidacy for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But his spokesman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gersuk </PERSON>, said infractions on the list could have been things other than black marketeering or fraternization violations. <PERSON> Mica </PERSON> has said the various agencies' procedures for handling potential security problems are chaotic and may need to be overhauled.

The film `` Some Like it Hot,'' starring <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, was filmed on location at the hotel in 1958, and Oz author <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, a frequent hotel guest, allegedly based his book's <ORGANIZATION> Emerald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> on the Del Saturday will feature a harbor tour with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup victor <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, a celebrity tennis tournament and a ball, followed by a turn-of-the-century style picnic Sunday with hot air balloons and a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> air show. Comedians <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Diller </PERSON> will be among the weekend's entertainers. But as current owner <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> tells it, the hotel itself nearly did n't make it to the party. When he bought the 399-room hotel in 1963, it had fallen prey to termites and neglect. `` There was no electricity in many places, no water above the second floor,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, the hotel's sixth owner. `` It was infested with termites and rats. This was a property that had everything but the bulldozer gutting it down.'' More than $ 40 million later, the hotel stands with its stateliness restored. It has new foundations, plumbing, heating, electricity and an $ 8 million fire protection system. A steel frame was implanted to bolster the Crown Room, a monumental dining room with a sugar pine ceiling that rises 33 feet. The hotel also was expanded. In 1970, the Crown Room was the site of the largest state dinner outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, with then-President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, outgoing President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, Mexican President <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordaz </PERSON> and 800 others. Today, about half of the hotel's guests are corporate executives. With 1,400 employees serving 700 suites, guests pay a premium for service, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. The hotel's average rate is $ 200 a day. It all began as a dream of railroad tycoon <PERSON> Elisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> and piano magnate H.L. Story, who envisioned while hunting on the barren peninsula a resort that would be `` the talk of the Western world.'' It was designed by three brothers, former railroad architects <PERSON> James </PERSON>, <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, and built largely by unskilled Chinese laborers. It became the largest structure outside of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to be electrically lighted, powered by the first power plant in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

 Firefighters recovered the bodies of two people Friday after a six-alarm blaze roared through an apartment complex, causing more than $ 1 million in damage and leaving 200 people homeless. Authorities have not determined the cause of the fire at <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s Racquet Apartments. All residents were accounted for. `` Firefighters found one adult and one child inside the building and were still searching,'' Fire Capt. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. The victims were not immediately identified. Three others were slightly hurt, including one firefighter with a knee injury. The fire destroyed or damaged 48 apartments, officials said. About 120 firefighters battled the fast-moving fire at the apartments near Love Field in 20-degree weather. Witnesses said some residents escaped from second and third-floor apartments by climbing or jumping from balcony-to-balcony. In addition to the those left homeless, another 100 residents lost electricity because the power was cut for several hours. Complex employees and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteers worked through the night to find temporary housing for residents. Most were temporarily housed in vacant apartments in other areas of the complex. Fire officials said it was the largest blaze in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> since flames swept through the <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> Apartment complex five years ago.

<HEAD>Iraq Says It Downed Unmanned Israeli Spy Plane</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Friday its air defenses shot down an unmanned Israeli surveillance plane over <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory near the border with <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the military command said it had no information about such an incident and an army spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said `` I believe we will not have any information.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, quoted a military statement as saying the remote-controlled aircraft was `` launched by the Zionists to jam Iraqi air defenses and monitor data for the hireling -LRB- <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> regime.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are locked in a 7-year-old war and often accuse each other of receiving Israeli aid. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its air defenses destroyed the craft at 5:44 p.m. Thursday near Al Ma'aniyah, a small outpost 185 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> on the Saudi-Iraqi border. It said the plane was launched from the `` occupied Arab territories,'' a reference to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Israeli-occupied territories. The agency gave no further details. It did not say what weapons were used to down the plane. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a senior military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, `` I think this report is rubbish.'' He expressed doubt that an Israeli drone could reach <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory. It would have to fly about 430 miles to get to Al Ma'aniyah. The report was believed to be the first of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intrusion into <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air space since Israeli jets destroyed an uncompleted <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> nuclear power station in 1981. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has pioneered development of radio-controlled reconnaissance craft, but these have usually been used on relatively short missions. The Israeli-made Pioneer unmanned surveillance aircraft has a range of 115 miles. Two other Israeli-made drones, the Scout and the Mastiff, have a range of 62 miles and 84 miles respectively. The craft look like oversized model airplanes. They carry cameras, sometimes including TV cameras that help their distant `` pilots'' steer the craft to their objectives. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been testing unmanned surveillance craft in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>.

 Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> ordered attorneys Friday to go ahead with a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, but held out hope for a settlement that would preserve jobs at the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> plant the automaker wants to close. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> does not want a breach of contract suit to be filed over its plan to lay off 5,500 auto workers at the plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, which it acquired when it bought <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last year, and has expressed a willingness to negotiate with the state. `` It would be better for both parties to settle this case quickly,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> telephoned him Tuesday and that a meeting was likely soon between state and company oficials. He declined to say where or when it would be held. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced Jan. 27 it would halt production of the Omni-Horizon autos Sept. 30. Attorney General <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanaway </PERSON> had advised the governor earlier that the state had a `` clearly enforceable'' agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> calling for Omni-Horizon autos to be built in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> for five years. At a news conference in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last week, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> defended his company's decision to close the aging <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> plant. `` We did not lie to anybody,'' he said `` Why would we?'' <PERSON> Hanaway </PERSON> said the state has a `` good faith basis'' for filing the suit. And even though no contract with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> was signed, `` I do n't consider this to be frivolous in any way,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> said company officials were sorry the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> plant had to be closed. `` I guess you could say <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> was overly optimistic'' when it told workers and government officials in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> that it believed it could build the Omni-Horizon small car at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> for up to five years, <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> said. `` But we never lied to anyone and we believe there are no grounds for a lawsuit claiming we did lie,'' he said. `` We never made any hard commitments.'' <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> always said market conditions would dictate the future of the plant. <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> would repay the city and county of <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> more than $ 1 million the governments spent on improvements for the plant. During <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>'s news conference, about 50 <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> autoworkers picketed for hours in icy slush and 10-degree weather outside his hotel to protest the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> closing. Outside, workers carried signs bearing slogans such as: `` 1st in Quality, 1st to Close;'' `` Work Hard, Get Worked Over;'' and `` <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> is a Liar,'' referring to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, who appears in television ads asking customers to trust <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Senators Ask Gorbachev To Allow Baltic National Demonstrations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirty-two Senators have written to <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asking him not to interfere with demonstrations and religious services scheduled this Sunday and Tuesday in the Soviet republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, it was announced Friday. The senators wrote <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` to urge you not only to allow the Lithuanian and <LOCATION> Estonian </LOCATION> people to peacefully honor their national independence days, but also to take all necessary measures to guarantee that they do not become targets of state-sponsored harassment before or after these commemorations.'' The state-controlled Soviet news media has criticized similar congressional statements in the past for inciting public demonstrations in the Baltic republics. The latest congressional letter, co-sponsored by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for not interfering with demonstrations by an estimated 10,000 people in the three <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republics last Aug. Those demonstrations marked the anniversary of the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact under which <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> agreed to allow <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> to invade western <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> allowed <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> to invade eastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. For years, the citizens of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> have celebrated, within the privacy of their homes, their pre-Soviet independence days in February. The public demonstrations in the Baltic republics last August came in response to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of greater openness, and brought warnings from two conservative members of the ruling Politburo, <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> security police, and <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s chief ideologist, that things were getting out of hand. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators wrote <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that they had received reports from emigre groups `` that 200 Lithuanians have written a letter informing you of their intention to commemorate their independence day on Feb. 16 with flower-laying ceremonies.'' Religious services also have been scheduled Sunday to mark the pre-Soviet national day in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, which remains overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> after nearly 50 years of rule by the officially atheistic Kremlin authorities. The senators said `` one report reaching the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> indicates that Soviet authorities may move to block these peaceful ceremonies.'' They cited a report of the beating in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> on Feb. 6 of <PERSON> Nijole </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadunaite </PERSON>, a leading Lithuanian dissident, `` in an apparent attempt to intimidate her.'' The Lithuanian <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, an emigre organization with offices in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, blamed the beating on plainclothes <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officers. The letter cited concern over `` official harassment and abuse'' against demonstrators and cited as an ominous warning a report in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda on Jan. 29 that <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> authorities `` had decided to intensify their efforts against ` bourgeois nationalsim and clerical extremism.'' The senators signing the letter, besides <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, were: <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash.; <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn.; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>,; <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, D-S.; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa.

<HEAD>NEA: Teachers Snaring Delegate Slots</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Friday its teachers turned out in force in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and are poised to grab a large share of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s Democratic convention delegate slots. The union said 10,000 members turned out for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic precinct caucuses in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last Monday, or 30 percent more than in 1984. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> members turned out in big numbers for pre-primary caucuses held Jan. 23 to determine who would run on candidates' delegates slates. The union, in its weekly political newsletter, boasted that its members snared more than 25 percent of the slots on the Democratic candidates' slates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The liberal union sent several hundred delegates to the last Democratic convention and several dozen to the Republican convention. It has refrained so far from endorsing any one candidate. But it has called all the Democrats acceptable and encouraged state affiliates to maximize the number of teachers running for delegate under any banner.

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential hopeful <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s environmental record won him the gold star in a report card issued Friday by a national environmental watchdog group. The League of Conservation Voters praised <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and Republican presidential hopeful <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> for their stands on the environment, while criticizing several other candidates, notably Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. The report gave the former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor high marks for his stands on air pollution, acid rain, land management and knowledge of worldwide problems such as depletion of the ozone layer and rain forests. Also scoring well among the Democrats were <LOCATION> Tennesee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, with <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> getting the most lukewarm reception for votes on water and population issues. Among Republicans, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s record in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on water pollution, toxic waste cleanup and population issues won him the league's highest score. League Chairman <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwelder </PERSON> slammed several Republicans, particularly <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for their records and unwillingness to respond to questionnaires about their environmental views. `` <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s record has gotten markedly worse in our last two charts, and the 50 percent grade we gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is probably better than some of his recent statements might suggest,'' <PERSON> Blackwelder </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Researcher May Be Barred from Further Drug Tests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A psychiatrist may be barred from conducting federally sanctioned drug testing because of alleged inaccuracies he published regarding an experimental treatment for Alzheimer's disease Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, received the warning last month in a letter from the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that involved his account of preliminary studies on tetrahydroaminocrydine, or THA, for combating the degenerative mental illness. After the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> published Summers' paper in November 1986, a public outcry arose for wider testing of the drug, which <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said was very promising The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> subsequently approved such broader testing, only to suspend it late last year because of an unanticipated number of side effects. The test procedures were redrawn and clinical trials allowed to resume last month. Summers submitted his findings on the Alzheimer's drug to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> five days after their publication in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> journal. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> letter to Summers noted that the journal article was submitted as part of his official report to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and said `` there are numerous statements in your NEJM article that appear to be false.'' `` We believe that you have repeatedly or deliberately violated regulations pertaining to the proper conduct of clinical testing of investigational drugs,'' said the letter from Dr. <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON>, director of an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> division that oversees compliance with agency research procedures. It said he may be barred from performing sanctioned tests in the future. The letter asked Summers to explain 14 specific instances where the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> found evidence of misinformation. It said those `` are not a comprehensive compilation of findings, but represent the more significant regulatory violations that remain unexplained.'' One of the 14 charges said Summers failed to report that eight patients in his study also were taking other drugs that could affect mental functioning, along with THA. Another said he failed to report that 10 of the 12 patients in one phase of his study lived more than 2,000 miles from his office and `` that medical monitoring was erratic and conducted mainly through telephone contacts and letters with either family members who had a variety of perceptions or local physicians who, you concede, often did not follow your research protocol.'' A third charge questioned what the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said is Summers' subsequent acknowledgement that some of the study statistics he submitted were reconstructed from memory `` It does not seem plausible that you precisely remembered multiple observations of the entire patient population without a written record,'' the agency said. Summers relayed word through his answering service Friday that he was not accepting telephone inquires about the subject. He has several informal and formal procedures available to him to defend his testing practices to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> letter was disclosed initially in a story in Friday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has not released the letter, but <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> obtained a copy from another government source. That source, who asked to remain anonymous, said Summers has replied in writing to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> but declined to release a copy of the response.

<DATELINE>EVESHAM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A convicted <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomber serving a life sentence married his American sweetheart Friday in a simple ceremony in the prison chapel. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 33, has been imprisoned for 14 years for bombings that killed seven people in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and injured 85. He says he is innocent and is hoping his conviction will be overturned by a new police inquiry. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was allowed to chat briefly with his bride, <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Severelli </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, after the short ceremony conducted by a Roman Catholic chaplain at Long Lartin Jail, 110 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He was then returned to his cell. But he was allowed to celebrate with his bride and about 15 guests at a brief reception later during which the couple cut a wedding cake. A prison spokesman said no alcohol was served and the couple remained under the watchful eye of prison officers. Ms. <PERSON> Severelli </PERSON>, a buyer for a paper mill, first wrote to <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> three years ago with news that a friend of his had died. After a year of writing, she flew to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to meet him. `` When I first saw him, he was just about everything I thought he would be _ gentle and feeling,'' she said `` He is not at all cynical even though he is not guilty and has been locked up for almost 14 years.'' Ms. <PERSON> Severelli </PERSON> said she is convinced her husband is innocent and hopes he will be able to join her in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if he is ever released. She did not give her age or hometown and the information was not immediately available from prison officials. Bombs exploded in October 1974 in two pubs in the town of <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, killing four soldiers and a civilian and injuring about 50 other people. The following month, a bomb blew up in a pub in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> district of <ORGANIZATION> Woolwich </ORGANIZATION>, killing two people and injuring 35 others. All three pubs were frequented by military personnel. Responsibility for the bombings was claimed by the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The group is fighting to end British rule in Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the province with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was one of four people convicted of the pub bombings. The so-called <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> Four have always maintained their innocence. Last July, Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> ordered a police inquiry into the bombings after receiving statements from a delegation led by <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, that expressed concern about the verdicts. Ms. <PERSON> Severelli </PERSON> said she and her husband had discussed the possibility that he might spend the rest of his life in jail, but they decided last spring to get married anyway. `` I do n't know if he will get justice in a British court. But I believe that good will triumph,'' she was quoted as telling The Guardian newspaper on Friday. Ms. <PERSON> Severelli </PERSON> has been staying at the Evesham Prison Visitor Center to meet the residential qualification for the wedding. She is expected to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> next week.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it had begun a special review of the insecticide dichlorvos, which is used in fly-killing pest strips and many other applications. The agency said studies on laboratory animals show the chemical may cause cancer and liver damage. Some 2 million pounds of dichlorvos are used in about 800 products every year. About 25 percent is used on farm crops, 35 percent on livestock, 25 percent in commercial and industrial buildings and on lawns and ornamental crops, and 15 percent in homes and on pets, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. Dichlorvos has been used since 1948 against flies, mosquitoes, gnats, cockroaches and other insects. Last Septmeber, the agency ordered new label warnings and restrictions on commercial use of most products to state-certified applicators, but did not restrict home and pet products. Workers are supposed to keep out of commercial and agricultural areas for 48 hours after treatment. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s special reviews can lead to fewer or more restrictions, a ban on the product or its exoneration. The agency tries to complete the reviews in 12 months to 15 months.

 <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has rejected a South African proposal for a regional peace conference that would include Angolan rebels, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Friday. It quoted a government statement as saying <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> was prepared to hold direct peace talks with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> if that country rejected the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a mediator. But the Marxist government rejected any negotiations that would include rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, according to the report monitored in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. It quoted the statement as saying, `` The reference to the participation of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> removes all credibility from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> government's proposal.'' It also claimed the proposal was a maneuver aimed at gaining time to increase South African military pressure on government forces in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said last month he was willing to participate in a regional meeting to resolve conflicts in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and that <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> should be represented. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has not specifically proposed a peace conference or put forward any concrete suggestions. Anti-communist <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have been battling the government since the Marxists gained power following <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975 The rebels are backed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and receive aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. An estimated 40,000 Cuban military personnel and Soviet advisers are helping the government forces. South African troops have made frequent incursions into southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> from neighboring <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, in its statement that rejected any talks with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, said it would be `` coherent and logical'' to include in a regional conference the <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION>'s Organization -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

No one identified as a Duvalier supporter is in the Cabinet but the new defense minister, Brig. Gen <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Regala </PERSON>, is not popular. Critics repeatedly demanded his resignation during the two years of junta rule after dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled the country Feb. 7, 1986. <PERSON> Celestin </PERSON> kept the portfolio of justice minister. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Philippe-Auguste </PERSON>, a former presidential candidate, is minister of agriculture.

Most of the members are known as liberals or moderates. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> was declared the winner of the Jan. 17 election, which was run by the junta, boycotted by the most popular presidential candidates and ignored by most Haitians. Philippe-Auguste, an agronomist, was one of the four main candidates Jan. 17. He and the other two who lost to <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> claimed the army rigged the vote in <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>'s favor. An election in November managed by an independent <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was called off within hours because bands of thugs, often joined by soldiers, killed at least 34 people and wounded 75.

Fifteen other Direct Action members were tried with the leaders, including one tried in absentia. Eleven were convicted of belonging to a criminal organization and given penalties ranging from suspended sentences to 10 years in prison. Two women were acquitted. A man and a woman were convicted on the lesser charge of brigandage and were given 18-month suspended sentences.

 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> allowed a citizen employed as a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> disarmament official to return to his job and family in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Friday after keeping him in his communist homeland for more than two years. <PERSON> Liviu </PERSON> <PERSON> Bota </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, said an `` error'' by Romanian authorities prevented him from returning after he was summoned home in December 1985 for `` urgent consultations.'' Speaking to reporters at the airport Friday night, he would not speculate on why he was let go, but said: `` It was an error made at some level and it's over now. I'm very happy to be back in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.'' He said pressure by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and others had helped. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamorano </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, said: `` The secretary-general, on behalf of all the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> staff members, is very pleased'' about <PERSON> Bota </PERSON>'s return. <PERSON> Bota </PERSON> will retain a director-level post but his disarmament job has been taken over by another official, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Gastaut </PERSON> said. He was met by his wife <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Martenson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Bota </PERSON> has claimed Romanian authorities put her husband under round-the-clock surveillance, following him with two cars and tapping or periodically cutting off his telephone. Romanian officials played `` deaf and dumb,'' insisting that <PERSON> Bota </PERSON> had no legal ties with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> or that his <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> contract was not valid, she said in a written statement published in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last month. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials intensified efforts on <PERSON> Bota </PERSON>'s behalf after his wife took an overdose of tranquilizers and other pills in May 1986. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> made repeated demands for his release, and the case also was on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights agenda. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, deputy secretary of state, met with <PERSON> Bota </PERSON> last week during a visit to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials would not say whether <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> had a role in the release. When he was called home <PERSON> Bota </PERSON> had been a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official for 13 years, on loan from his government, and had headed the disarmament institute since 1980. President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s government later told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bota </PERSON> was resigning his disarmanent post, but <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials refused to accept the resignation unless it was submitted in person. He was not allowed to do so and the Romanian government later accused him of espionage. There have been other cases in which <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials from the Soviet bloc were detained during visits to their homelands and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> intervention had no effect. One of the most publicized cases was that of <PERSON> Alicja </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesolowska </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who was detained on a visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. She was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1979 on charges of spying for a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nation that was not identified. <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stultz </PERSON>, an East German employe of the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization, was arrested in March 1980 while visiting his country and convicted of `` anti-state'' activities.

 The dollar soared in value Friday against most major currencies around the world after the government reported that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit shrank for the second consecutive month in December. Gold prices rose. At <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the late bid for the precious metal was $ 445.50 a troy ounce, up $ 5 from Thursday. `` We've got the excitement at last,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, an economist and currency analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` Within 30 seconds that the trade numbers came out there was an immediate adjustment -LRB- upward -RRB-.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that the nation's merchandise trade shortfall shrank to $ 12.2 billion in December from $ 13.2 billion in the previous month, as exports jumped 4.2 percent The December gap was the smallest since a $ 11.9 billion deficit in January 1987 and much lower than market analysts had predicted. The dollar had risen about two yen and it was up around two cents against the British pound and the Swiss franc shortly after the trade report was released, according to <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>. Later in the day, though, some profit-taking and a reluctancy to hold dollar positions through the long <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Birthday holiday weekend helped pushed the American currency off its highs, traders said. `` Even though the numbers are good nobody wants to go home sitting on dollars because all the old fears have n't dissipated,'' said <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, `` those fears being that the trade deficit is still too big and that the dollar may have to fall further to get rid of it.'' The dollar's protracted decline in value began more than two years ago as a result of coordinated efforts by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its main trading partners to improve the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade picture and avoid protectionist legislation. In in the past several weeks, however, the dollar's value has been relatively stable. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsch </PERSON>, senior money market analyst for <ORGANIZATION> LNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the dollar also was helped Friday by a rise in interest rates in the credit markets. He said dealers believe the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> wo n't move to push rates lower in order to prevent the dollar from falling. Rising interest rates tend to support a currency because they attract foreign investors eager to buy higher-yielding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities. The dollar rose above 130 Japanese yen for the first time since mid-December, trading at 131.15 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> from 129.95 earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, and up from 129.03 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> markets were closed for a national holiday. Later, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar stood at 130.925 yen, up from 129.265 late Thursday. The British pound fell to $ 1.7401 from $ 1.7595 late Thursday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Sterling fetched $ 1.74175, down from $ 1.76075 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the highest level since late November. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.7115 West German marks, up from 1.69085; 1.4087 Swiss francs, up from 1.3895; 1.26445 Canadian dollars, unchanged; 5.7820 French francs, up from 5.7210; and 1,260.75 Italian lire, up from 1,248.20. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Thursday: 1.7123 West German marks, up from 1.6885; 1.4065 Swiss francs, up from 1.3870; 5.7865 French francs, up from 5.7135; 1.9225 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8961; 1.2624 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2663; and 1,260.75 Italian lire, up from 1,246.65. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 445.30 a troy ounce, up from $ 440.00 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against EPA in Pesticide Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has n't proven it can legally authorize the retail sale of small amounts of the pesticide chlordane as part of a deal to ultimately take the anti-termite chemical off the market, a federal judge said Friday. The agency's latest court filing does not satisfy federal law which requires the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to determine that a pesticide will not unreasonably harm the environment, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberdorfer </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> believes that chlordane causes cancer. To avoid a protracted battle with 197 distributors, the agency has agreed to let them sell chlordane already in stock. In return, the companies are argeeing to cancellation of their licenses to sell the pesticide. <PERSON> Oberdorfer </PERSON>, however, said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had produced no evidence to back its assertion that distribution of remaining stocks wo n't cause undue harm The lawyer representing the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, argued that insisting on the use of the procedures in the law would in the end mean less environmental protection in this case because distributors could fight the revocation of their licenses and continue selling chlordane products during what could become protracted hearings. The judge asked the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Misuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pesticides </ORGANIZATION> to submit a draft order declaring use of remaining stocks of chlordane illegal, but he gave no indication of when he might rule. The coalition and others have been seeking such an order since October. It is unclear whether the order will make a difference. No one knows how much chlordane distributors have, though the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says it believes the amount is very small. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> concluded last year that excessive chlordane residues can remain in a home even after proper application. Generally, chlordane is injected under pressure into soil around the foundation. The only manufacturer of chlordane, <ORGANIZATION> Velsicol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> agreed last August that <PERSON> Velsicol </PERSON> would no longer sell it while the company tries to come up with an acceptable application method. The company and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> later agreed to end use of <PERSON> Velsicol </PERSON>'s inventories, but the stocks of companies using chlordane in their own products were n't covered by the agreement After the hearing, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Perliss </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> lawyer working with <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, said the companies had reported holding a total of about 1,700 pounds. This would be 1.6 percent of the amount in <LOCATION> Velsicol </LOCATION>'s hands in August, or a two-month supply at the then-prevalent usage rates

<TEXT>
 The head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to a review of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords accused <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and its allies Friday of hampering progress on a final document by stalling on human rights issues. `` What we see now is that things are beginning either to level off or in some cases to go backward,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said at the third follow-up Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Textual obligations are festooned with loopholes that deprive them of all force,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> told a plenary meeting, referring to Soviet bloc draft proposals. `` For example, freedom of religion must be consistent with public safety, order, health and morals. Other freedoms are limited by national legislation.'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> told a news conference that in the three weeks since the meeting resumed after a Christmas break he noticed `` a very serious effort'' by the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc to put off an agreement. `` I hope it's tactical and I hope that it will change,'' he said. Delegates from 35 countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and all European nations except <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> have been meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> since November 1986 to review compliance with the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords on military security, economic cooperation and humanitarian issues. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> rejected Soviet bloc assertions that the West is stressing humanitarian concerns at the expense of European disarmament issues. `` We're not holding any element here hostage to any other element,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said. He also said the `` obstructionist'' approach of Soviet bloc governments at the conference has been accompanied by `` disquieting'' signs of failure of those same governments to observe <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> commitments at home. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> noted that a Soviet promise to release all `` religious prisoners'' in an amnesty last November was not kept and the elimination of psychiatric abuse is still awaited `` despite promises made as recently as yesterday.'' He said he noticed similar human rights abuses in other bloc countries, including <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The concluding date of the conference has been postponed twice. Before Christmas, diplomats set the deadline for Easter but some Western dilopmats now say summer would be more realistic. The accords, or the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act, include commitments to honor human rights, individual freedoms, travel and other exchanges among nations. The 35 signatory nations promised to honor the covenant's provisions but the accords have no enforcement mechanism.

 Angry tenants and a banner reading `` Welcome You Reptile'' greeted a landlord Friday when he reported to one of his buildings to serve a 15-day sentence of house arrest for failing to correct housing violations. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, 77, who lives in a luxury high-rise in the <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, will be confined to a fifth-floor apartment in a building where tenants complain of bugs and rodents, lack of heat and hot water, and leaky ceilings. His movements will be monitored by an electronic ankle bracelet to make sure he serves his sentence. A judge convicted Gross of criminal and civil contempt in December after the city <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> brought action against him for failing to comply with a court order to correct housing violations. He was fined $ 32,000 for the contempt conviction and $ 137,900 in civil penalties. Judge <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkavy </PERSON> gave him the option of spending 15 days under house arrest and putting the $ 137,900 toward the cost of correcting the 420 violations at the 113-unit building in the Flatbush section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. Asked why <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> chose house arrest, his attorney, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopilow </PERSON>, said Gross `` wanted to show to the judge and the community that this is not as bad as portrayed in the press.'' Gross made no comment to the group of angry tenants who shouted at him when he walked into the lobby Friday morning. The landlord, whose meals will be catered, will have a private security guard with him in the apartment during his sentence. `` We ask for so many things and they do n't do anything,'' said tenant <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramdeo </PERSON>. He said the door to the apartment where he lives with his parents is off its hinges, bathroom tiles are falling off the wall and their stove does n't work. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, president of the tenants' association, took a group of reporters on a tour to show them some of the violations. She pointed out a large hole in the ceiling of one apartment from which `` water comes down like crazy.'' Tenant <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> complained of flaking paint chips, which she has discovered her 2 -LCB- - year-old daughter eating <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Carelli </PERSON>, the housing agency attorney who handled the case, said there were still 400 outstanding violations in the building, some dating back five years. Building superintendent <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilgrim </PERSON> said Gross had spent $ 1 million to repair the building. `` We know Gross is not an angel. We know he should not have let the building run down so far, but work is getting done,'' Pilgrim said. Ms. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> charged that cosmetic repairs had been done on only 10 to 12 apartments. `` When you subtract that from 113 apartments, you'll see the real <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>,'' she said.

<HEAD>MIA Remains Transported Without Informing Widow Due To Oversight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged late Friday that `` due to an oversight,'' the remains of a Vietnam War victim had been transported from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> this week without informing the man's widow. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> also said they could not explain why a request by the widow to withhold public announcement of a military laboratory's identification of the remains had not been honored. The widow, <PERSON> Erna </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said Thursday in a telephone interview she had asked that the identification be withheld because she wanted to obtain a second opinion to verify the military's forensic work. Last Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> had succeeded in identifying six sets of remains repatriated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. One of the six, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said, had been identified as <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Clemie </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, an aviator who was lost over <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on April 14, 1972. <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, who was 26, listed his home as <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, at the time of his disappearance. `` I told them I did n't want them to release the identification because I was n't prepared to accept the finding; that I wanted a second opinion,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, who contacted reporters after news stories about the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement appeared. `` And then they did it anyway. And then they're bringing in the remains and nobody told me.'' The remains of <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> and the other five MIAs were transported from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Travis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on Thursday. Since <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials were responsible for dealing with his next-of-kin. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> casualty assistance officers had earlier informed Mrs. <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> of the procedures that would be followed for transporting the remains. `` Unfortunately, due to an oversight, the transportation arrangements were not confirmed to her before the public announcement,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said after consulting with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials. The spokesman said he did not know why Mrs. <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>'s request to withhold public announcement of the identification was not honored. `` All I can say is that we routinely abide by the family's desires on that point,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said `` If we had been aware of that request here -LRB- at the Pentagon -RRB-, we would have made sure the identification was not released publicly. `` Regretably, there were misunderstandings or misinterpretations in this case and we're now working with the family to remedy those. We will work very closely with the next-of-kin to satisfy their preferences and desires.'' Mrs. <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> said she wanted to have the remains moved to another forensic scientist in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> for detailed examination. `` I'm not trying not to accept their identification,'' she said. `` I'm just not ready to accept some of their evidence. And that's why I did n't want their identification announced yet. Although the work of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s laboratory has been verified for the most part, there have been instances in which independent scientists concluded the laboratory did not have sufficient evidence to justify a finding of positive identification.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> helped raise more than $ 500,000 in political funds Friday at a gathering of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> high-rollers, demonstrating he is still a big drawing card for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. The president and first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were the featured attraction at a reception at the <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> mansion of millionaire-businessman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>. The affair behind the walls of <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>'s spacious estate was closed to reporters. Among the dignitaries seen entering were Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., who is up for re-election this year, and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Republican Gov <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. Before leaving the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the president was briefed by <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, his national security adviser, about two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships being deliberately bumped by two Soviet warships in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Sunny skies and warm temperatures greeted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, in contrast to the fog and cold he left behind in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. More than 50 couples paid $ 10,000 each to sip champagne and have their picture taken with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> during their 45-minute appearance. The fund-raiser was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s only scheduled event in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. On Saturday, he will fly to a <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> resort of <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, for afternoon talks with President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>, then travel to his mountaintop ranch near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for a four-night stay. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s political director, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON>, said that with less than three weeks' notice, there was no trouble lining up big-money contributors eager to mix with the president, who was wounded by the Iran-Contra affair and has only 11 months left in office. `` The president will always be able to be a good fund-raiser,'' <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON> said. The money will go to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Republican Party. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will hold another fund-raiser later this year to help the re-election campaign of Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON> said He said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is `` one of our top targets this year.'' With its late primary, the state could play a decisive role in the Republican presidential race. With 47 electoral votes at stake, the most of any state, it will be a major battlefield for the November election. `` A strong, well-financed <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will be a benefit to whoever the nominee is,'' <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, at a gathering of Republican conservatives Thursday night, pledged to `` campaign vigorously for whoever our nominee is.'' Reporters were excluded from the fund-raiser at the home of <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>, who lives on the estate once owned by the late hotel magnate <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>. A real estate tycoon, <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> also is chairman of the Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has revenues of more than $ 1 billion and is best known for its subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Dole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the pineapple and banana distributor. On Saturday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will meet with de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION>, a resort area troubled by drug-related violence. A senior administration official who briefed reporters in advance of the Reagan-de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> meeting said both <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are critical of the other's handling of the drug problem. `` The Mexican perception is that we are the world's largest market for drugs _ cocaine, marijuana and heroin _ and that we are not doing enough to reduce the consumption of dangerous drugs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said the official, who spoke on condition he not be identified. At the same time, he said, the administration believes <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is making increasing, but still inadequate, efforts to fight drug trafficking. `` The flow of drugs is increasing ... and, in our view, the amount of the drug-related corruption is growing,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s prime minister said after a chilly meeting with <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Friday he was not satified with the British attitude in a dispute over police conduct in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. British officials said the 30-minute meeting between Prime Minister <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> was `` calm and dignified,'' but an Irish statement said <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> `` could not regard the present response of the British government in the areas of principal concern as satisfactory.'' The statement said <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> was still waiting for `` an adequate response'' to Irish protests made at an inter-governmental meeting Feb. 2. Friday's meeting was the first between the two leaders since <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> acknowledged on Jan. 25 that there was evidence of a coverup after police in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province killed six unarmed Roman Catholics in three separate incidents in 1982. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said there would be no prosecutions. There are fears the affair could damage the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which is aimed at bolstering the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority's confidence in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> justice in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> expressed her belief that the Anglo-Irish Agreement must continue, as therein lies the future,'' a British spokesman said after the meeting, referring to the 1985 pact giving the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> a consultative role in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> affairs. He spoke on condition of anonymity following government practice. The killings of five Irish nationalist guerrillas and a teen-ager prompted charges that police had a shoot-to-kill policy. An investigation found no evidence of official shoot-to-kill tactics, but said officers lied and tried to cover up their practices. At Friday's meeting, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said the decision not to prosecute was not influenced by her administration, since it was made by the <ORGANIZATION> Director </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecutions </ORGANIZATION>, who is not a member of the government. It was endorsed and announced, however, by Solicitor-General Sir <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayhew </PERSON>, a Cabinet member. He said prosecutions would not promote `` national security'' or be in the `` public interest.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> promised <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> that <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, her minister for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, would make a statement soon about the `` organizational implications'' of the affair, the British spokesman said. This was interpreted as a suggestion that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is considering changes in the Royal Ulster Constablulary, which draws most of its personnel from the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> majority. King has said disciplinary action could be taken against officers involved in the affair. <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> met during an emergency economic summit of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>.

 Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> on Friday accused <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s rival <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential campaign of `` deliberate distortions,'' and won a standing ovation from conservatives when he lectured the former television evangelist on the need to obey the Ten Commandments. `` I ca n't insist that all candidates abide by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 11th commandment'' not to speak ill of another Republican, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said in an address to the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` But all of us should abide by the Ninth Commandment: Thou shalt not bear false witness,'' he said to prolonged cheers. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was scheduled to address the group immediately after <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, but bad weather grounded his airplane in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and prevented his appearance. But his campaign issued a statement calling the congressman's charges `` totally unfounded. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Snapp </PERSON>, an aide, said, `` Contrary to the charges, we have investigated and found that no <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> staff member was involved in the distribution of the material in question.'' In <LOCATION> Merrimack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said: `` We did n't put out any of this stuff he's talking about. ... It's ridiculous what he's talking about. Meantime, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, staying at the same hotel, met for 30 minutes Friday night. Asked whether they were striking a deal, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said: `` We just had a nice, pleasant chat and a cup of coffee. He feels good about his chances. I feel good about mine.'' When asked if he would want to inherit <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s supporters if <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is defeated, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> responded: `` I said we ought to put out the melcome mat. These are good people. They're looking for a party to join in many cases.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s demand that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> repudiate a television commercial being aired by his campaign as well as fliers distributed in early primary and caucus states reflected the stakes involved in the early stages of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential campaign. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s bid to emerge as a clear conservative alternative to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has been damaged by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s surprising showing in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and in other states, making next Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> primary a critical test. Thus, while <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said at a news conference that the Republicans would be taking a `` step backward'' if they nominated either the vice president or the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator, he saved his sharpest words for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> avoided leveling an accusation of dirty tricks personally against <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, but said the former minister's campaign was guilty of `` deliberate distortions.'' `` I would like him to call off the flier and the ad,'' he said following his speech. `` I would expect a response from <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s anger was generated by printed material saying he was soft on pornography and suggesting that a member of his family had had an abortion. `` It's a lie,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunette </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> aide, said of the abortion suggestion. `` There is absolutely no truth in it whatsoever.'' Distributed to fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> voters in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the material purports to reproduce ratings of the Republican candidates by the Biblical Scoreboard, which is published by <ORGANIZATION> Biblical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldron </PERSON>, editor of the news service, said the material was altered and he described it as `` a malicious, nasty, underhanded attempt to smear men who are running for president and an obvious affront and attack on Biblical News Service.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman also complained about a <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> television commercial that cited a study by <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Econometrics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> saying that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had the best economic proposal of all the contenders and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> had one that would bring on a depression. The commercial cites a Wall Street Journal story on the forecast, but <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the newspaper's coverage amounted to ridicule since it placed the report `` in a humor section.'' In addition, the Journal printed an editorial on Feb. 5 denouncing the use of its story in the television commercial. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, in his formal remarks, said he had welcomed <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s followers into the ranks of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` But the contribution ceases to be positive, the cause and values that we represent are tarnished when such deliberate distortions are permitted to persist,'' he said.

 Leftist guerrillas exploded dynamite under a troop truck on a mountain highway Friday, killing 10 soldiers and wounding 14, officials said. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> confirmed the attack by guerrillas believed to belong to the Mao-inspired Shining Path organization, which has been fighting for eight years to topple the government and establish a Marxist state. An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, later said two of those killed were officers and several of the wounded were badly hurt. In violence elsewhere Friday, a Marxist university professor considered ideologically aligned to Shining Path was shot and killed in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> the guerrillas set off dynamite near the highland state capital of <LOCATION> Huanuco </LOCATION> as the troop truck passed. `` The explosion nearly totally destroyed the vehicle,'' said <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesa </PERSON>, a correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programas </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s leading news station, in a live broadcast from <LOCATION> Huanuco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mesa </PERSON> said the attack occurred 15 miles outside of <LOCATION> Huanuco </LOCATION>, which lies 185 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The soldiers were en route to repair a bridge destroyed during torrential rains on the eastern slopes of the Andes. Five hooded assailants killed Professor <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON>, 47, after locking two of his children, aged 13 and 15, in another bedroom, police said. At the time of the pre-dawn attack, <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON>'s wife and four other children were in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, 230 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON> was a philosophy professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huamanga </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, where he was known as a Marxist who reflected the views of the Shining Path, police said. The assailants escaped. Police refused to speculate about their identity and said an investigation was under way. The attack follows an upsurge of violence this week by rebels, who shot and killed four policemen and the wife of one of the officers, and five state telephone workers. The government says more than 10,000 people have died in the Shining Path insurgency. Human rights groups say hundreds of the dead were non-combatants caught in the crossfire between rebels and government forces.

 Three former police officers who pleaded guilty to federal corruption, racketeering and cocaine trafficking charges were each sentenced Friday to 30 years in prison and $ 350,000 in fines. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON>, 28, <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, 28, were among the original seven <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police defendants whose first trial ended in a hung jury last year.

<TEXT>
 Three <ORGANIZATION> Calvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> science professors who taught evolution instead of the biblical version of creation were sharply criticized in a report released Friday by trustees of the private college. But the report, which followed a yearlong investigation by a study committee, called for no sanctions against the professors and concluded that their teachings fell within guidelines set by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> for interpretation of the Bible. The report was `` very critical in a studied, careful, pastoral way'' of the professors' writings and teachings, said the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridder </PERSON>, chairman of the board. It was supportive of the professors' concern for exploring theories other than creationism, but <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridder </PERSON> said the panel `` reminds the professors of the limitations that the guidelines place upon the interpretation of the Bible.'' The board said those guidelines allow the teachings of such theories as evolution, but that they `` ought to be evaluated in terms of the Christian faith,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Harn </PERSON>, provost of the college. The study committee was formed in response to dozens of critical letters about the professors from students, faculty, church members and others, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridder </PERSON> said. The professors, <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Menninga </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> geology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Till </PERSON> of the physics department, who have a combined 52 years at <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON>, did not attend the board's news conference. However, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Till </PERSON> said in a statement that he respected the board for `` recognizing the need for academic freedom'' and that the report contains both `` criticism and praise and speaks of both caution and encouragement.'' The committee `` urges me to refine my interpretative methods in such a way that neither the ` event character' nor the revelational meaning of biblical history will be called into question,'' he said. The professors describe themselves as loyal, longtime members of the 300,000-member, Grand Rapids-based <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> ended his quixotic quest for the presidency Friday, endorsing <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and attacking Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as no more than a spectator in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration councils. Asked his opinion of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s involvement in important decision-making, the former secretary of state said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had merely `` been there, period.'' More than 200 reporters and at least 30 television cameras were in the room for <ORGANIZATION> Haig </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement, by far the most coverage he received at any time in his year-long campaign. He withdrew from the race for the Republican presidential nomination at a news conference on a day when a snowstorm played havoc with the schedules of the remaining candidates. He opened by saying his assessment of the race had made it clear that `` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> will not be the 1988 Republican nominee.'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> received less than 1 percent of the vote in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> precinct caucuses on Monday and was receiving only about 1 percent support in polls of Republican voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. He endorsed <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as the candidate who `` embodies best my understanding of the crucial challenges we face.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> appeared briefly at <ORGANIZATION> Haig </ORGANIZATION>'s side to say the endorsement `` means a great deal to me personally'' and that the former <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> commander had told him he wanted no role in a <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> administration. While free with his praise of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> seemed to relish even more his attacks on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` What have you got against <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> was asked. `` Not a single thing in terms of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he replied. `` He's a friend, I've known him for 20 years.'' But he went on to say that he had worked with both men for two decades and `` from my point of view, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is head and shoulders above <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a potential president.'' `` Most important of all,'' he said, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> exceeds <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in `` the demeanor, the internal strength, the ability to deal eyeball to eyeball with those who do not share our values around the world.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later phoned WKNE in <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> to boast that he won the immediate endorsement of state Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION>, one of <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s three state co-chairman. Then on <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> television, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> `` thinks that I'm head and shoulders above <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s greatest contribution to the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign may well have come earlier, during televised debates when he pressed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his role in the Iran-Contra affair and asked him if he had been `` in the cockpit or ... on an economy ride in the back of the plane'' as vice president. When asked Friday about reports of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> involvement with Panamanian strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said, `` I do think there's been less than forthright discussion of this issue by the vice president.'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> withdrew four days before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, and when asked about the timing he replied in a sentence typical of what had become known during his public career as <PERSON> Haigspeak </PERSON>: `` It takes a bit of arrogance to be so ego-involved in a campaign such as this that you want to take the few percentage points that could be critical to another candidate to the political graveyard. `` I'm not that way. I want to make a difference.'' As a candidate, the 63-year-old retired general who had announced last year he was `` throwing my helmet into the ring'' was often openly critical of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration domestic and foreign policies. Speaking with the authority of having been <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> has criticized the president's approach in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and also has opposed the INF treaty to eliminate medium-range missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On domestic issues, he has said the record federal budget deficits of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years stemmed, in part, from the policies pursued by the administration, making him the only candidate other than <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to lay some of the blame somewhere other than on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In campaign appearances <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> was fond of saying he had served under seven presidents and recalling his strong role as chief of staff in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> during the final months of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s presidency. At a Republican dinner in <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION> Wednesday night he quipped, `` I'm the only one -LRB- of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates -RRB- who's been president before and I liked it.''

<HEAD>Ethiopia Calls Report Of Resettlement Killings `Unfounded'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government accused foreign media Friday of a disinformation campaign and said a report that <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> troops killed at least 20 civilians at a drought relief camp was `` unfounded.'' `` Fanatics of one calling or another have in recent months tried to disrupt the relief distribution efforts and their accomplices continue to fabricate such unfounded allegations,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the government agency responsible for drought relief. `` This latest unfounded report is just another instance,'' the commission said in a statement. Foreign relief sources in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> said Thursday that Ethiopian troops opened fire on thousands of drought victims when civilians resisted forced resettlement. Twenty people were killed and many others wounded, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The sources said the shootings occurred Monday at the northern town of <LOCATION> Korem </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, 525 miles north of the capital, <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. `` No one in his right mind can imagine that any responsible person can commit such an atrocity against drought victims,'' the commission said. The commission said it had stated repeatedly that the resettlement program was voluntary. <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> and its northern neighbor, <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, are the hardest hit by a drought that threatens more than 5 million Ethiopians with starvation. Drought in the northern regions has been exacerbated by a civil war in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s Marxist government began the resettlement program in November 1984 with a goal of moving 1.5 million people from the overpopulated, drought-ravaged north to unused, fertile land in the south and west. At least 600,000 people were resettled before the government halted the program in February 1986 amid charges from the West that people were being forced to move, sometimes at gunpoint. Critics said the government's aim is to depopulate the north, which is home to two rebel movements. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> resumed resettlement Nov. 25, promising the program would be voluntary and humane.

 About 500 people demonstrated outside the headquarters of an electric power company in southwestern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Friday protesting a test at a nuclear power reactor. Some of the demonstrators had stayed overnight at the site after attending a rally Thursday that police said drew 1,500 people. The protesters at the headquarters in Takamatsu of the <ORGANIZATION> Shikoku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elecric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> opposed an output test at the company's nuclear reactor at <LOCATION> Ikata </LOCATION> that was conducted Friday. <PERSON> Takamatsu </PERSON> is 340 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ikata </LOCATION> is 115 miles southwest of <PERSON> Takamatsu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sueaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Maekawa </PERSON>, a member of a local anti-nuclear group, said, `` The protest action was initiated by ordinary people, such as housewives, who have no affiliation with big organizations. It is really encouraging.'' Police spokesman <PERSON> Yasunori </PERSON> <PERSON> Aya </PERSON> said about 300 police officers were sent to the demonstration Friday to keep order. The protesters were `` noisy but not violent'' and there were no arrests, he said. A <ORGANIZATION> Shikoku </ORGANIZATION> company official said that in the test, the reactor's output was reduced by 50 percent over a period of three hours The official, speaking with the condition he not be identified, said the test was made to collect data on rapid reactor output shifts dealing with the fluctuating demand for power. Protesters said the test was similar to one conducted at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power complex in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on April 26, 1986 that resulted in a fire and the world's worst nuclear accident. The Soviets said at least 31 people perished from the fire or radiation. The company official said the tests were different. He said the Soviets tried to stop the turbine completely and the Japanese test only involved a 50 percent cutback. He said the Soviets also disconnected safety devices at the Chernobyl plant, while the devices at the Ikata reactor remained in operation. The <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Soichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, director-general of <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, as saying there was was no cause for concern about the safety of the test.

 Bus drivers and mechanics overwhelmingly approved a contract proposal Friday night to end an 11-day strike that had left 90,000 daily riders without public transportation. The board that runs the <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> transit system also approved the tentative agreement and hoped to restore bus service by Sunday morning. `` Strikes are tough. ...

Negotiators concluded an all-night bargaining session Friday morning by announcing they had reached a compromise agreement. The three-year proposal gives the union greater job security and wage increases of about 5 percent the first year and 4 percent each of the two final years, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said union leadership urged passage of the settlement, which was approved at a union meeting by a 465-40 margin. The strike against the <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> transit agency began Feb. 2 over wages and the company's proposal to use part-time employees to supplement regular workers during peak transit hours. The union, which represents about 750 bus drivers, mechanics and clerks, strongly objected to part-time employees in the belief they pose a threat to the jobs of full-time employees. A top-scale bus driver made $ 12.17 an hour, under the old contract. <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> says drivers were making about $ 30,000 a year when routine overtime was figured in.

 A group of 30 prominent intellectuals appealed to communist authorities to respect the right of free association, but the state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency called their petition unnecessary. In a commentary on its English-language service released late Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the appeal's `` postulates seem to be somewhat belated, like trying to pry open doors which are already open.'' It said the signers `` do not take notice of ... very important changes which have occurred and continue to occur in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s socio-political life,'' including a relaxation of censorship to allow public debates on `` practically all internal problems. In December, the Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party approved a package of political reforms that includes a pledge to ease curbs on forming independent associations. However, a new law on associations has not been passed yet, and authorities have blocked efforts to form some independent groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a lobbying group favoring private enterprise. The intellectuals' petition was submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 1 and was made public this week. The appeal said it is `` impossible to start overcoming -LRB- <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s -RRB- crisis without real, and not only declarative, respect for the citizens' right to free association.''

 A British group said Friday it could not afford to buy a secondhand Spitfire for a new World War II museum in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. More than 20,000 of the famous British fighters were built and saw service from 1938-1954. The wartime cost of a Spitfire was 5,000 pounds _ then about $ 24,000. `` There are n't many Spitfires left and when the French asked us to try to get one, we were told the cost would be 300,000 pounds -LRB- $ 522,000 -RRB- or more. We could n't face up to that,'' said Lt. Gen. Sir <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Haris </PERSON>' British support committee for the Memorial Museum of the Battle of <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Caen </ORGANIZATION> is now trying to raise the equivalent of $ 87,000 to buy a secondhand Typhoon fighter-bomber. `` It's not a bad substitute,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 77, was the first British regimental commander to enter <ORGANIZATION> Caen </ORGANIZATION> on July 9, 1944. He spoke at a news conference to announce his committee's appeal for a total of $ 261,000 for the museum. The money will pay for British war relics ranging from a Churchill tank to a miniature radio transmitter used by intelligence agents landed before the invasion of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on June 6, 1944. `` It's somewhat disconcerting that while it was British troops who first entered <ORGANIZATION> Caen </ORGANIZATION>, other countries whose forces were never in the city are giving the museum substantially more importance and support than we are,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. He said that in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, for example, 300,000 members of a <ORGANIZATION> Normandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> plan to support the museum project. Troops from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and 11 allied countries fought in the 78-day battle around <LOCATION> Caen </LOCATION>, and nearly 300,000 soldiers were killed. <LOCATION> Caen </LOCATION>, 115 miles west of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, suffered 10,000 civilian deaths.

Later on <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> television, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> `` thinks that I'm head and shoulders above <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>.'' `` I think we can pull it out here,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he continued to compare the race to 1980 when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lost <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and won <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and the nomination. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his wife, and Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, his state chairman, holed up in the Clarion Somerset Hotel, his campaign staff scrambled to find voters and photo and visual opportunities nearby. About an hour before dark, when at least a foot of snow had accumulated, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared that he `` had a touch of cabin fever,'' emerged with his <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents and staff, and led an entourage of about 35 on an hour-long forced march through the adjacent <LOCATION> Somerset </LOCATION> condominium project. At first <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted he was headed for a shopping mall, until his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, told him he knew the stores were closed by the storm. Television crews, so bored during the day that they videotaped each other in the near white-out outside the hotel, came to life when two or three people braved the weather to shovel out their cars. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his staff tried to persuade condominium dwellers to let them help shovel or rescue their cars from the snow but each declined politely. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who tried to entice people to allow <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to help shovel with `` come meet the vice president, come meet the vice president,'' offered the opinion that `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> people are independent.'' And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> concurred: `` Only in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.'' The television crews were reduced to aiming their cameras at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> petting puppies in the arms of their masters and mistresses. A snowplow driver finally allowed the vice president to get behind the wheel of his machine, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drove the snowplow about 10 yards down an already-cleared road.

 Accidents involving <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> flights killed 47 people last year, officials said Friday. They also said the Soviet national airline made $ 3.3 billion and transported 119 million passengers in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, which claims to be the world's largest airline, is notorious for its flight delays and poor service. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the airline, said a program was under way to improve <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>'s standards. `` We people engaged in civil aviation are not satisfied with the safety and regularity -LRB- of flights -RRB- that now exist,'' said <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Panyukov </PERSON>, first deputy minister of civil aviation. However, airline officials said at a news conference that <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>'s safety record compares favorably with that of major Western carriers. Last year, 47 <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> passengers and crew members were killed in accidents, said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Potemkin </PERSON>, deputy chief of flight services. In the past, Soviet officials were reluctant to give details of aviation accidents and casualties. But <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> has said that starting this year, fatality figures would be made public, a measure clearly linked to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for `` glasnost,'' or greater openness on some issues. On Jan. 18, an <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> jet missed the runway in the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Krasnovodsk </LOCATION>, flipped over and broke in two. Eleven people were killed and 12 others injured. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency and the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported the crash the same day, marking the first time a fatal Soviet air accident was reported in the official media on the day it occurred. Officials told reporters that <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> plans to replace its planes with newer models. <PERSON> Panyukov </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> will also lay off some of its 500,000 employees. He did not say how many. <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, responsible for all civil aviation in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, has more than 15,000 airplanes and helicopters, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> officials said the carrier made about 2 billion rubles last year, the equivalent of about $ 3.3 billion.

 Five rare old navigation charts on vellum, the oldest dating from about 1460, will be sold in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in April. <PERSON> Auctioneers </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s said the charts were found recently `` in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' after being hidden since the time of <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s campaigns. The seller's name was not disclosed. Two documents are by a well-known family of chart makers, the Teixeiras of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, and date from 1587 and 1620. The oldest chart was made in <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION> about 1460 and depicts the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION>. Another was by a Dutchman and based on a <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> model about 1600. The fifth is of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and the Baltic in 1588 by Englishman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Laton </PERSON>. The finely inked and colored charts, with flags, coats of arms and even saints, show ports in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and later in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>. They are expected to bring from $ 12,000 to $ 87,000 each at the April 13 sale. `` For a long time before the French Revolution the charts were owned by a Flemish family, the counts of <LOCATION> Maldeghem </LOCATION>, who were burgomasters of <ORGANIZATION> Bruges </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- now in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Soames </PERSON> of <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s books and manuscripts department.

 A former nurse's aide who is serving life prison terms for 34 slayings was indicted Friday for the murders or attempted murders of six more patients at <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s Drake Memorial Hospital. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> is expected to plead guilty to the indictments next week when he is brought to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> from his <LOCATION> Lucasville </LOCATION> state prison cell, assistant <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Deters </PERSON> said.

The <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury indictment returned charges that <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> fatally poisoned two of the patients, killed another by suffocation and poisoned the three patients who survived. Families of the victims have been notified, Deters said. The indictment charges <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> with three counts of aggravated murder and three of attempted aggravated murder, alleging that the crimes occurred between April and November 1986. The victims were identified as patients at <LOCATION> Drake </LOCATION>, a Hamilton County-owned hospital that provides long-term care and rehabilitative services. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> was employed at <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> as a nurse's aide from February 1986 until his April 1987 arrest. Authorities identified the three patients who were killed as <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, by suffocation, and poisoning victims <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Nalley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>. The three who survived poisonings were identified as <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernsden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>. Officials declined to provide the patients' hometowns or ages. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> pleaded guilty last August to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> charges that he killed 25 people, including 21 <ORGANIZATION> Drake </ORGANIZATION> patients. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> knows of more murders, his lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said Friday. `` We know there are more, but either they are n't establish-able or <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> needs additional assistance with them,'' <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said. But Deters said he anticipates no further indictments against <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>. `` Hopefully, this is the end of his story,'' he said. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> is serving a concurrent <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> life sentence for the deaths of nine patients at <LOCATION> Marymount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, when he worked there from 1970 to 1971.

 Cuban officials boarded a U.S.-registered sailboat Friday only hours after they released the vessel, which had been fired upon and seized the day before, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The three people aboard the Tranquility radioed a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Friday evening that they were on their way to <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The 48-foot sailboat, fired upon and seized Thursday night, was released Friday morning. It had sailed north-northwest some 25 miles when it was again stopped and boarded by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. They were again released and the three people, proceeded on their way, he said. A passing merchant ship reported to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> late Thursday that shots were fired across the 48-foot Tranquility's bow off <PERSON> Cayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guajaba </PERSON>, on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s northern coast, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. The Tranquility told the merchant ship by radio that it was then taken in tow by the Cuban patrol boats. Reports from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> showed the sailboat was released early Friday, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. Crew members were two men and a woman whose names have not been released, the spokesman said. `` The Cuban foreign ministry has stated that the Tranquility had drifted into Cuban waters due to a lack of wind and was assisted into the port of <LOCATION> Nuevitas </LOCATION>, and subsequently released,'' a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement said. The appearance of the Cuban patrol apparently frightened the sailboaters into flight. The Cubans may have fired warning shots because they did n't understand why their order to halt was disobeyed, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` They could n't communicate,'' he said. `` The merchant vessel told our operations center that the people on Tranquility were speaking only English and the Cubans were speaking only Spanish. `` We've never had a problem with the Cubans harassing pleasure craft,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` At this point we do n't even know why the <LOCATION> Cubans </LOCATION> would want to shoot at this boat.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> radio reported Friday that another U.S.-registered boat, carrying 7,700 pounds of marijuana, had been seized Feb. 6 in Cuban waters and its four crewmen taken into custody. The Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> captured the <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> near the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunas </LOCATION> province area in northeastern <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, reported a <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rebelde </ORGANIZATION> broadcast monitored here. The arrested crew members were identified as Puerto Rican-born <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancharte </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> natives <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Inocente </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lores </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rebelde </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> left the island illegally in 1979 and that <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> left in 1980. All four were arrested and detained and the marijuana was burned, the radio said. The report did not specify whether the Cuban natives were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. Coast Guard officials said they had no knowledge of the incident.

 A military spokesman said Friday the armed forces will investigate allegations that high-ranking officers are involved in drug trafficking. Col. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON> told reporters, `` This situation worries the High Command, and all of us.'' `` We are going to investigate.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> published an article Friday saying senior Honduran military officers and a drug dealer linked to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> are setting up a major narcotics smuggling operation in this Central American country The Times story quoted unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Honduran officials. Asked about the allegations, <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said: `` We do n't rule them out because there are no means to refute them, nor is there proof of guilt.'' `` The armed forces call on the The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> to provide the names of those Honduran officers involved in the alleged drug trafficking, as well as the corresponding proof implicating officers of our army,'' he said. `` With the proof in hand, we will move drastically against those responsible ... and we will punish them with all the weight of the law,'' said <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, the spokesman for the armed forces. The Times article identified <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballesteros </PERSON> as a principal figure in the alleged operation. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, a Honduran, escaped from a Colombian jail in 1985 and is considered a key dealer for Colombian cocaine barons. He lives in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in connection with the 1985 murder in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent. Honduran law does not allow extradition of Honduran citizens. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>, named for the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> city in which it is based, is responsible for more than 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Honduran Congressman <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said Friday the High Command should report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on possible drug trafficking involving the army. The High Command consists of the only general on active service and about 55 colonels and lieutenant colonels. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> called on President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> to investigate <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s activities. <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> heads a civilian government but the military wields great power. The congressman, from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, suggested that representatives of the High Command be called before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to testify. He said he would form part of a congressional commission that will travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> next week to discuss the accusations with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen, senators and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials. Radio and television stations and afternoon newspapers reported the allegations in the Times article.

 Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> reached agreement early Saturday on agricultural spending, ending nearly a year of deadlock, a spokesman for the executive commission said. `` We have an agreement on a farm package. We are having a good summit,'' <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON> told reporters at the end of the two-day meeting. The agreement came after significant concessions by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, who had sought stringent budgetary controls to end soaring farm spending. `` It has been a very tough <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said early Saturday. `` But what is important is that for the first time we have effective and legally binding controls on expenditure.'' The accord set production limits on the most expensive crops: Grains and oilseeds and proteins, with penalty price cuts for surpluses. It was the third summit attempt in eight months to solve the financial crisis. The 12-nation EEC, or European Common Market, has operated without a budget since December. Proposals endorsed by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, current president of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, envisaged looser curbs on the community's farm spending than <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> initially was willing to tolerate. The community agreement boosted by 80 percent over the next five years regional aid to the four poorest members _ <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The increase will bring regional aid to $ 16.25 billion by 1992, compared with a 50 percent rise favored by the wealthier states inluding <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. West German spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> said his country's chancellor, <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, did his best to change Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s mind in private talks Friday `` The chancellor made it clear ... we now have arrived at the outer limits of what we can do,'' <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> told reporters. On the key issue of overall limits on farm spending, which consumes two-thirds of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s annual budget, the last-minute compromise document called for a $ 34.4 billion maximum this year, slightly higher than in 1987. That was consistent with British demands, compared with a $ 36.9 billion limit favored by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The compromise document also called for a 160-million metric ton annual limit on cereal production _ the level wanted by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, compared with 155 million tons sought by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Every ton above the 155 million costs the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> about $ 175 million annually in export subsidies. As a sweetener to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, the proposals called for a 9 percent price cut spread over three years from 1989. On the other most expensive crops, oil seeds, the final proposal called for price cuts and production quotas midway between British and other demands.

 An airport restaurant employee who gave Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> a $ 4.95 beef sandwich without charging him was fired Friday for `` misappropriation of company funds.'' `` Police officers at the airport get free coffee, sandwiches and doughnuts,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bueschel </PERSON>, 23, said after getting his pink slip. `` I figured if <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police officers could get a free sandwich, why couldn ` t the mayor.'' <PERSON> Bueschel </PERSON> said he was fired by management of <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> when he reported to work Friday afternoon. He said the reason for his dismissal was listed as `` misappropriation of company funds.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, upon hearing about <PERSON> Bueschel </PERSON>'s firing, was not pleased, said the mayor's press secretary, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` He thought that they had carried policy to its extreme limit and that if the young man did n't find a job, he'd find him a job or give him a job himself because he did n't think the punishment fit the crime,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bueschel </PERSON> said restaurant managers <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Accetura </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> told him he was dismissed from the $ 5-an-hour job at the Cafe Volare as a result of not charging <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> for a sandwich Thursday. <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he would have no comment. He said <PERSON> Accetura </PERSON> was n't at work late Friday. There was no home telephone listing for <LOCATION> Accetura </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> directory assistance. <ORGANIZATION> WLS-TV </ORGANIZATION> reported that restaurant managers thought they had to fire Bueschel because other company employees had been dismissed for giving food away and they feared that making an exception would lead to a discrimination lawsuit. `` It's company policy not to give anything for free to friends and such, but as far as the mayor is concerned, I thought this was the way to take care of the guy,'' <PERSON> Bueschel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was at the airport on his way to a speaking engagement in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> when he got his free meal from <LOCATION> Bueschel </LOCATION>, a six-month employee of the cafe. A security officer for the mayor had ordered the sandwich, which he then received with a note from <LOCATION> Bueschel </LOCATION> on the take-out box: `` Mr. <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON>, keep up the good work. Compliments of Cafe Volare.'' <PERSON> Bueschel </PERSON> said the mayor then returned the favor with a handshake and said, `` Thanks for the sandwich.'' Bueschel is a sophomore at <ORGANIZATION> Richard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a school named for the longtime mayor who died in office. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was appointed mayor by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> last year after the death of Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, main author of a Central American peace plan, urged <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Thursday to halt arms shipments to insurgents in the region. He said <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s new image would be tested now. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for drafting the peace accord signed last August by himself and the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. He said in a message broadcast nationwide on radio and television: `` We must struggle, with the help of the whole world, so that the shipment of arms to insurgents in the region stops.'' Then he directed the call specifically at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He said the image being fostered by Soviet leader <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> _ less dogmatic and relatively tolerant _ would be put to the test in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- should cease all armed support, direct or indirect by means of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, to insurgent forces.'' Leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> have been waging an 8-year-old guerrilla war against the U.S.-backed government there. The guerrillas reportedly receive some of their weapons from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc supporters who channel the arms through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The guerrillas deny the reports of outside military aid. They say their arms are purchased on the international black market or captured from government forces. `` Today there is a chance for peace like never before in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, `` an opportunity for democracy in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> like never before. There is a last chance to defeat poverty and to prevent misery, protected by dictatorships, from perpetuating itself.'' He expressed the hope that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will move resolutely toward making its society more democratic, and that peace talks between combatants in both <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> will resume and bear fruit. `` It is they who must choose between war and peace,'' he said. Cease-fire negotiations between U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels and representatives of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government are to resume next week in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. Peace talks between the two sides in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> have stalled. The government says they will not be resumed until after legislative and municipal elections March 20. The Arias accord demands cease-fires in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>; greater freedom and democracy throughout <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>; an end to outside aid to insurgent forces in the region, and a halt to the use of any country's territory as a base for attacks on another nation.

 A team of doctors Friday reattached a man's left hand to his arm 2 -LCB- months after it was joined to blood vessels in his abdomen for temporary preservation following an accident. Twelve doctors and support staff spent 22 -LCB- hours in surgery on <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a 31-year-old ironworker from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. He was listed in serious condition. The accident in which <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> lost his hand was a pulling and tearing injury rather than a clean cut, making it difficult for doctors to determine the extent of possible nerve damage. They also were concerned about the potential for infection in the wound. Therefore, they decided to attach the hand to his abdomen to preserve it for a future reattachment to his arm. `` The blood flow has been re-established but it might be weeks or months before we can determine how much function he'll have,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perrin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>'s public relations office. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> might be able to leave the hospital within two weeks, although further surgery might be needed, she said. `` ` So far, so good' seems to be the attitude right now,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> lost the hand, wrist and a small part of his forearm when he grabbed a cable to break a 70-foot fall from a girder while he was working at a church Nov. 24. The cable wrapped around his forearm and pulled his hand off about six inches above his wrist. The day after <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> fell, plastic and reconstructive surgeons attached the arteries, veins and skin of the hand to those of his abdomen. Such a temporary attachment has been used twice, once successfully, in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. `` To our knowledge, this is the first time a severed limb as been kept this way'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, spokesman for the hospital. The surgeons' goal was to give <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> a hand with enough sensation to protect it from injury and to allow him the use of it as a helping hand, one that is better in appearance than a false one, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said.

 Democratic presidential hopeful <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said Friday that rival <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> should withdraw negative advertisements from television and radio or `` take off the bow tie because he's just another politician as long as they're on.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, battling with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> for second place in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s leadoff primary Tuesday, on Thursday began airing ads that highlight what he called `` inconsistencies'' in <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s record as a congressman from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> After alluding to their intensifying dispute during a state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dinner at which both spoke, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said at an impromptu news conference, `` Enough is enough on these negative ads.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said the spot `` impugns my character and my integrity by saying, can you trust this man? `` I've never impugned <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s character. I've disagreed with a lot of his crazy ideas ... but I have never once questioned <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s motives or his integrity or whether he could be trusted,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` I asked Sen. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> to take those ads off television. And if he does n't, he ought to take off the bow tie because he's just another politician as long as they're on.'' At an earlier appearance, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he would be running different ads starting this weekend, but not because <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> asked him to. After the Democrats' dinner, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he did not believe the dispute with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was harmful. `` As long as it does n't get too acrimonious, I think a healthy comparison is good,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. From <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign counsel said telegrams had been sent to television stations in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, Me., asking them to sell <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> time for response ads to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said the stations have generally agreed to sell <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> such time for the ad, which will begin running Saturday. <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said he had not seen the ad. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s campaign has described the ads not as negative but as simply comparing the candidates' records. But <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said the spots question his motives by suggesting his record shows he's not trustworthy, and he added: `` I do n't agree with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s balanced budget amendment that -LRB- <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is -RRB- for. I do n't agree with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s line-item veto that he's for. I do n't agree with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s sub-minimum wage, which he's for. I do n't agree with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the Gramm-Rudman bill, which <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> voted for and supported, which would have been the fulfillment of ` Reaganomics.''' `` I do n't agree with his changing his position on an oil import fee, changing his position on whether we should talk to the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, changing his position on the balanced budget amendment.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> added, `` I've never questioned his motives. I think he's trying to do what he thinks is right. That's what I try to do.'' `` So if we're going to get into this business of going back through 8,000, 9,000 votes, it's fine. We can go through them all. I'll stand with every vote I made.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he would not withdraw the ads aimed at <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. `` We may be changing ads, but we're not going to do it in response to his request.'' He said he had `` never claimed that there is complete consistency in my record or anyone's record. But there is a difference between absolute consistency, which no one has, and a pattern of inconsistency. The positions that <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is taking today in the campaign are appreciably inconsistent with his positions in the past.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> sed he did vote against one balanced budget proposal because it had `` unsound limitations.'' He said he voted against an oil-import fee that lacked rebates for poor people and he flatly denied that he changed his position on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. As he did in his initial response Thursday to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s ads, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> acknowledged that he has changed some of his positions over the years. `` Nobody's perfect. Things change, you make a vote, it did n't turn out the way you thought,'' he said `` But to say someone is not to be trusted, or someone's motives are bad because you voted a certain way on the B-1 bomber, is just ridiculous.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> have acknowledged they essentially are fighting to place second in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. At least for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a third-place finish could pose severe trouble for his campaign. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> after watching a sled-dog race in <LOCATION> Laconia </LOCATION> in the middle of a fierce storm that dumped more than a foot of snow on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> on Friday. He had to change into dry clothes before the law-school speech, and he appeared before the standing-room-only crowd in blue jeans and a plaid shirt. And, before his speech, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said: `` I do n't take this election for granted. You know when you're No. 2 and you're trying to be No. 1, it's like <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> _ you've got to try harder. So I'm trying harder. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> reiterated familiar themes in his speech, stressing the need for an economic overhaul and painting himself as anti-establishment while calling his opponents `` apostles of the status quo.''

<HEAD>Four Dead, Scores Hurt In Rebel Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CEBU CITY, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist rebels killed three police officers and a street vendor and wounded dozens of others in a series of attacks late Friday in this central Philippine city, police said. Police said the four people were killed when a dozen gunmen aboard a jeep opened fire at police officers directing downtown traffic in the city, about 350 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The assailants hurled a grenade at pursuing officers, injuring dozens of pedestrians, police said. Authorities said they believed the attackers were communist rebels. None were captured. The rebel <ORGANIZATION> Jovito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> recently announced plans to increase attacks in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, the country's second largest city. Mayor <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Osmena </PERSON> described the attacks as `` shocking'' and vowed to increase security in the city. Police said 25 people were taken into custody for questioning and seven were given tests to determine if they recently fired weapons. Results of the tests were unavailable and police said no one had been charged. The 25 were rounded up at a movie theater which a young girl told police she saw the gunmen enter. The theater was surrounded, the film stopped and the patrons were led out one by one for questioning. Soon after the shooting, the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> Ricadrdo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>, made a rare broadcast statement in which he denounced the attack as an `` act of savagery.'' `` I appeal to those people of evil motives, please put a stop to your savagery,'' the cardinal said. `` We are all chidlren of God.'' Communist guerrillas have fought the Philippine government since 1969.

<HEAD>Army Ad Pulled from Magazine Because of Article on Gays, Editor
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdrew a full-page advertisement from the February edition of Student Lawyer magazine because the issue featured an article on homosexual law students, the magazine's editor said Friday The decision to pull the ad came shortly before a federal appeals court on Wednesday overturned as unconstitutional the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s ban on homosexuals, editor <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoban </PERSON> said. `` It is very ironic; the timing could n't be better,'' she said. The cover article in February's edition of the magazine, a publication of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, is titled `` The Legal Closet.'' The piece by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> free-lance writer <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is an examination of gay law students and contends that anti-gay fears and prejudices are common in law schools and within many law practices. In a note to readers, Ms. <PERSON> Hoban </PERSON> said the writer had encountered many people who were afraid to discuss homosexuality. In the note, she said an advertisement had been withdrawn from the issue, but did not identify the advertiser as being the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Hoban </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that the advertiser was the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the ad had been withdrawn by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s New York-based advertising firm, <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Hoban </PERSON> said she suspected that the Army might be bothered by the article, so she had her advertising director contact <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> and tell the firm that the article would appear in the February issue. <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> then withdrew the ad. `` They did n't threaten us,'' she said. `` They just said they wanted to pull it. It's their right, though I'm sorry they did it just a week before we went into production for this issue.'' Young & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> could not be reached for comment by telephone late Friday. Calls after business hours to the agency's <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> offices went unanswered. Lt.

<TEXT>
 Highly efficient and obedient, robots have replaced workers who used to shout strike slogans and have helped <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> vault from financial gloom in the 1970s to a leadership role in the world's auto industry. The task of turning a deficit-burdened company, faced with high absenteeism and low productivity, into a vanguard, highly profitable enterprise took nearly 10 years and required massive annual investments of about $ 830 million. At one point, the Italian automaker turned to Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> for money, but in a sign of financial health it bought back <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s minority share a decade later and avoided a threat to defense contracts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The era of robotics took a heavy toll on the work force. Employment at <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> auto was cut by nearly half, to 72,000 workers by the end of 1987, from 138,000 nine years earlier, according to figures given by Italian trade unions to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. By increasing automation, <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> improved productivity and reduced costs, ushering in a period of high profit that allowed the <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON> family, which controls the company, to expand its financial empire into telecommunications, insurance, banking and retailing. <PERSON> Vittorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghidella </PERSON>, who became the managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>'s auto division in 1978, and <PERSON> Cesare </PERSON> <PERSON> Romiti </PERSON>, who took over as managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> group a year later, are unanimously considered the architects of the group's impressive recovery Given a free hand by Chairman <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON>, whose family has been the controlling <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> shareholder since his grandfather founded the Turin-based company in 1899, <PERSON> Ghidella </PERSON> and <PERSON> Romiti </PERSON> set <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>'s course through the end of this century after subduing the tough opposition of the metalworkers union Through temporary layoffs of 24,000 workers and the dismissal of 61 involved in acts of violence and sabotage inside the factories during disruptive walkouts in 1979-80, <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> regained `` control of the plants and on production,'' <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Besuzzo </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>'s work planning, said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. A march by 40,000 foremen and white collar workers, supporting <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>'s policy, helped end 35 days of strikes in 1980 and foiled a possible occupation of the plants threatened by the most radical groups of strikers, who were openly supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. During the most difficult years of labor tensions, worsened by a drop in demand in the wake of the world oil crisis, <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> was burdened with unsold stocks of about 500,000 cars while absenteeism ranged from 15 percent to 20 percent. Ironically, it was in large part the mounting opposition of trade unions to the traditional and stressful assembly line work that drove <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> toward heavy investments in computers and robots. `` It was a dramatic but unavoidable choice,'' said <PERSON> Besuzzo </PERSON>. `` Fiat was the first -LRB- European -RRB- auto company to brave the risks of heavy investment in automation. The result was a less expensive and better product and, after some years, an impressive economic improvement.'' At present the <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> group relies on 1,550 auto robots, or about half the total robots in use in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Besuzzo </PERSON> says there is more room for even more advanced automation in the Fiat plants. `` For sure we have a technological leadership over Japanese and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> makers in flexible robotized lines, which can assemble parts of different models. Robots in the spray painting division could soon cover 60 percent of the production, up from 40 percent, while the percentage of robotized work in assembling parts would rise to 25 from 3 percent,'' he said. Many of the robotic systems have been supplied by <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>'s factory automation unit <ORGANIZATION> Comau </ORGANIZATION>, which has also sold systems to major European and American auto makers, including <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>. The Tipo, the latest midsized model which is expected to boost <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>'s ambitions of becoming <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s No. 1 automaker at the expense of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, is being assembled in the factory at <LOCATION> Cassino </LOCATION>, which is <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most automated The model, unveiled Jan. 26, has a competitive price in comparision with European models of the same class. It required the most expensive investment for a <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> model _ nearly $ 1.6 billion. However, investment in automation has produced highly successful returns so far. Since the beginning of the decade, the <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> group has nearly doubled net income from one year to the next.

 The auto division achieved a turnaround in 1983 after more than 10 years in the red. It had piled up estimated debts and losses of about $ 416 million by 1979. The auto sector accounts for 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>'s revenue now. Industrial vehicles, tractors and earth-moving machines bring the total to about 72 percent. The group boosted its net earnings to $ 522 million in 1984, to $ 1.1 billion in 1985 and $ 1.8 billion in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>, which last year took over state-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Alfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romeo </ORGANIZATION> to increase its dominance in the Italian market, has a 61 percent share of the domestic market of automobiles _ a higher percentage than any other major European car manufacturer _ and a 14.3 percent share in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It holds a minor share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, as the bulk of its production is made up of small-sized cars. However it has high hopes for the Alfa Romeo models. The luxury 164 Alfa, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s most expensive mass-produced sedan, will be marketed aggressively in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> while another <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Ferrari </ORGANIZATION>, has a healthy market for its sports cars overseas. In the face of growing automation and a modest increase of auto demand in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Besuzzo </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>'s auto employment is not expected to rise or decline through the'90s. <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotito </PERSON>, secretary of the metalworkers division <ORGANIZATION> Unione </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lavoratori </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- UIL -RRB-, one of the largest Italian trade unions, agreed with <PERSON> Besuzzo </PERSON>'s predictions. <PERSON> Lotito </PERSON> emphasized that the sharp cut in employment resulting from robots at <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> did not cause a dramatic social impact, thanks to layoffs subsidized by a state fund, early retirements and re-employment of some workers in state jobs. `` At the beginning we had nourished the illusion that automation could co-exist with a high rate of employment,'' he added in an interview. `` That proved wrong, yet we did not oppose technology in the factories because we were aware it was the only possibility to keep the auto industry competitive. Unions which opposed automation, like in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, only caused the collapse of the companies and massive dismissals.'' The growing health of the group, and of the <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON> dynasty, has recently been worrying some Italian politicians. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose relations with <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> became tense following a bitter controversy over the candidate to head <ORGANIZATION> Telit </ORGANIZATION> _ a joint telecommunications venture between <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> and the state holding copmpany <ORGANIZATION> IRI </ORGANIZATION> _ accused the <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> group and the <PERSON> Agnellis </PERSON> of dominating Italian industry. Some politicians called for an anti-trust law on grounds that industrial and financing holdings directly or indirectly controlled by the <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON> family have a market capitalization equal to 22.8 percent of the entire Italian stock market. <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>'s influence on the Italian news media also came under questioning. <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> owns the <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stampa </ORGANIZATION>, has effective control of the Rizzoli publishing house and <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s influential <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> newspaper and has expressed some interest of moving into commercial television <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON> recently cooled down the controversy, noting that <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> revenue accounts for less than 4 percent of the gross domestic product. `` The three major state-controlled holding companies together account for 10 percent and this is not causing any worry,'' <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON> is such a well-known public figure that he is often referred to merely as `` L'avvocato,'' the title for a laywer in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> -LRB- he holds a law degree -RRB-. He is always widely quoted, whether it be on business or politics or <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s most successful soccer team, <ORGANIZATION> Juventus </ORGANIZATION>, which he owns.

<HEAD>Relief Agencies Take Risks Getting Food to Mozambique's Hungry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SENA, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Getting food to hungry people caught in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s guerrilla war has become more and more risky and expensive for international relief agencies. Anti-government guerrillas, who have sabotaged rail lines and roads, now have threatened to shoot down relief planes. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> stopped flying to areas outside provincial capitals last Christmas after receiving a threat from the guerrillas. CARE International, which runs a famine relief food transport program in cooperation with <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s government, is now operating airlifts to remote areas the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> once served. `` But we do n't know how long we can keep it up,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Neff </PERSON>, an American who is CARE's director in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. He said it costs eight times more to move food by air than by truck, but 16 districts in four provinces can be supplied only by plane. Six towns can not be reached at all, he added, because of sabotage to the rail and road routes or the heavy concentration of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas fighting the Marxist-led government. On a recent CARE flight that carried reporters to <LOCATION> Sena </LOCATION>, the main highway could be seen below pitted with trenches and blocked by tree branches. Tracks on the railroad line were torn up. The guerrillas have rocket-propelled grenade launchers, many of captured from the army, `` but they can bring down a plane with a pistol if they hit you right,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mispelaar </PERSON>, CARE's international operations manager The guerrillas have blown up the longest railroad bridge in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Sena </LOCATION>. They often carry away railroad tracks, set explosives on the lines and have made road travel so dangerous that 85 percent of Western food aid does n't move unless it can join an army convoy. `` We ca n't count the cost of vehicles sitting idle, waiting for convoys,'' said <PERSON> Neff </PERSON>. Most of the difficulty in getting grain from a seaport to a hungry refugee in the drought-stricken <PERSON> bush </PERSON> is due to guerrilla attacks on the transportation system. Until last year, the guerrillas kept one of the nation's primary rail, road and oil pipeline routes, the <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Corridor </LOCATION>, inoperable most of the time. But in 1987 <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> arranged for troops from neighboring <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> to guard the corridor between <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION> and help defend the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> port. The corridor is <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s cheapest route to the sea. Other neighbors also help: Soldiers from <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> are stationed along the <LOCATION> Nampula-Nacala </LOCATION> route in the northern part of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> where sabotage still occurs regularly; troops from <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> have been assigned to guard recaptured towns, freeing Mozambican troops to retake other vital targets. `` If you protect 10 percent of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> you protect 90 percent of the economy of the country,'' said Trade Minister <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Aranda-Silva </PERSON> in an interview. `` You need only have the transport system linked with that 10 percent. This is survival. It is not growth.'' Most of the <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION> railroad track has been relaid with concrete ties instead of timber ones, Canadian rails, and heavier ballast. It is much harder to sabotage and an explosion is less likely to derail a train. The <LOCATION> Nampula-Nacala </LOCATION> line, most useful for Malawian exports in the north, still needs to be relaid, as does a line from <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> down the <LOCATION> Limpopo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>. It goes through arid regions where security is difficult, and where the track is so flimsy a saboteur can simply walk away with the rails. Moving donated food from overseas to nearly half of the <LOCATION> Mozambican </LOCATION> population under such conditions requires constantly shifting strategies, explained <PERSON> Mispelaar </PERSON>, who is from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. `` Immediately after you hear about a local highway blocking, you move spare food up on available charters, get everything off the roads in that area, move other shipments up by sea, reschedule certain donations so they go to a different port,'' he said. `` When the bandits -LRB- rebels -RRB- came to know about a shipment and attacked 60 kilometers -LRB- 37 miles -RRB- north of <LOCATION> Chokwe </LOCATION>, we could n't move the other trucks we had kept back on standby. Bags start piling up, looting starts. You can tip the balance with the smallest mistake.'' CARE, nevertheless, distributes more than 300 tons of food a day to market places and refugee centers throughout the country. Planes unload bags of corn and rice on air strips. Women wearing only wrapped skirts in the blazing sun trudge in single file for hours, carrying the bags on their heads. They often are guarded by soldiers. Some food is loaded onto tractors and taken over roads where land mines are hidden. Other bags are carried by canoes to isolated farming settlements. Food is a priority, so there are shortages of clothes, tools and seeds. `` There are more people coming out of the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> to the resettlement camps,'' said <PERSON> Mispelaar </PERSON>. `` They come with nothing but if you can give them a few seeds, basic tools, some bamboo poles and a little food, they start building, they start planting, they are not totally dependent on handouts.''

 Past glories and future dreams of this economically depressed mining town two miles up in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> are pinned to a bill now inching its way through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The measure aims to bless the National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum, now housed in the old <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> junior high school here in <LOCATION> Leadville </LOCATION>, with a federal charter. Such a charter brings no bucks but would qualify the museum for inclusion on lists of national historical sites and maps and other official documents _ and museum boosters believe that will lure thousands of mining buffs. Tourist dollars are badly needed in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> where unemployment stands at 22 percent, the highest in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. The state's average unemployment rate was 6.4 percent in October, the last month tallied. <LOCATION> Leadville </LOCATION> is the highest town in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and an historic mother lode of legends and lore from the bygone silver and gold rush days. `` We think having the hall of fame and mining museum will provide a cornerstone for revitalizing <LOCATION> Leadville </LOCATION>,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Chlouber </PERSON>. `` We may be one of the richest six cubic miles on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> because of our minerals, but we have to diversify.'' Fifty-four mining museums are scattered around the country, according to the industry. They range from one-room displays to the new $ 1.1 million <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> at Grants, which spotlights uranium; the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Butte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, which showcases copper; the American Mining Hall of Fame in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and an exhibition coal mine at <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> But none claims a national designation, say backers who want The National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum to become an educational center for the entire industry. The museum, set up as a non-profit corporation, was chartered by <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> in 1977 and has members in 31 states. Industry giants such as <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ASARCO </ORGANIZATION> support the idea, and many mining executives serve on the board of trustees. Bills designating the <LOCATION> Leadville </LOCATION> site as the nation's official mining museum were introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a year ago. On Feb. 4, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> unanimously approved one version and sent it to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> with 40 co-sponsors. An identical resolution is stalled in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with only half the 218 co-sponsors required to move it through the legislative process. Museum advocates are chomping at the bit, counting on the federal charter to help them raise $ 1.5 million to construct initial exhibits. For more than a century <LOCATION> Leadville </LOCATION> has been synonymous with mining. In the 1800s, thousands of adventurers dug gold and silver, found in the town's namesake veins of lead, from surrounding mountains. Legendary characters such as gambler and gunfighter <PERSON> Doc </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>, suffragette <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, the `` unsinkable'' <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and English writer <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON> were attracted to the boom town 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, then a nondescript little frontier settlement. In this century, <LOCATION> Leadville </LOCATION>'s sought-after metal was molybdenum, used to strengthen steel. <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION>'s Climax mine north of town, which provided steady paychecks through two world wars and the Great Depression, employed 3,200 people in 1981. But <LOCATION> Leadville </LOCATION>'s mining collapsed in 1982 because of declining steel-making and a world molybdenum glut. Climax now keeps just 48 men on a skeleton maintenance force. Town leaders, accustomed to <LOCATION> Leadville </LOCATION>'s boom-bust history, at first did n't believe large-scale commercial mining was finished. But as <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s unemployment soared and For Sale signs sprouted like weeds, committees were formed to plot economic strategy. <LOCATION> Leadville </LOCATION> is 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>, 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION>, and surrounded by some of the nation's most spectacular scenery, including two of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s highest peaks, <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Massive </LOCATION>. One campaign that fizzled over time was `` Operation Bootstrap,'' aimed at coaxing more tourists to the town of 3,300 people, half the county's population. The National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum was nothing but an idea looking for a home when a search committee received <LOCATION> Leadville </LOCATION>'s application in 1986. `` We heard there was a national competition for the mining museum, and this community went after it,'' said <PERSON> Chlouber </PERSON>. `` That effort marked the first time everybody in this town really came together and forgot about their little turf battles. `` Being out of work will do that to you,'' said <PERSON> Chlouber </PERSON>, a former shift boss at the Climax mine but now unemployed except for his legislative job, which pays just $ 11,500 a year. `` When we're all unemployed we support each other. To lure the museum, the school board offered the old junior high and its 71,000 square feet of space for 50 cents rent a year. The county donated parking and free utilities for two years. The town offered office space, snow removal and improved traffic routing. <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> volunteered to make promotional films, supply audio-visual help for exhibits and lend its local campus for mining seminars. `` We need this museum,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Luoma </PERSON>, who owns the Golden Burro Restaurant with her husband, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>. Both lost their jobs when the Climax mine closed. They gambled their life savings to buy the cafe on <LOCATION> Leadville </LOCATION>'s main street. `` We've got to all pull together to bring new businesses and attractions here. This is a great place to live, full of wonderful people, and I hate to see many of them leaving because there are n't any jobs,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Luoma </PERSON> `` The museum can be our showpiece and help make <LOCATION> Leadville </LOCATION> famous again.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeder </PERSON>, the museum's executive director, said the Victorian-style junior high building would eventually be converted to house a library, geology hall, lecture auditorium and rooms detailing the history of American mining. The Hall of Fame plans to periodically pick a person who's made a major contribution to mining. `` We want to show visitors there's virtually nothing you can look at that mining does n't have some impact on,'' said <PERSON> Reeder </PERSON>. `` Did you know 17 minerals go into making newsprint? That 14 minerals are needed to manufacture basic cosmetics? `` College enrollment in mining engineering is down in this country from 4,000 students in 1977 to 616 this academic year,'' said <PERSON> Reeder </PERSON>. `` We want this museum and hall of fame to stimulate people's awareness of how important this industry is, both its past, its present, and its future.''

<HEAD>`Baby' Actors Enjoy Virtuous Roles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> did n't mind playing two squares in the comedy hymn to marital fidelity, `` She's Having a Baby. In fact, they liked the movie's emphasis on old-style morals. `` Old-fashioned is new-fashioned, let's face it,'' <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> said. Director-writer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> `` is basically an old-values type of guy in all his movies,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said. And his story of a young couple, <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, is `` a tribute to suburbia'' and to the virtue of commitment. Though the actors are young _ Bacon is 29, <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> is 26 _ both are examples of another old-fashioned virtue: hard work. They recently talked about just how hard it was to bring out `` Baby.'' One scene _ the <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>' wedding _ was shot over 26 consecutive hours. It was filmed in the <ORGANIZATION> Winnetka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, which was available for only a limited time. Two versions of the scene were filmed: a straight-forward account of the wedding, and <PERSON> Jake </PERSON>'s hallucination about what his wedding vows really mean. `` <PERSON> Wilt </PERSON> thou listen to endless conversations about children's clothes and decorator checkbooks? the minister asks in the fantasy version. The marathon session demanded a lot of Bacon. `` I actually fell asleep on my feet,'' he said. <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, who previously appeared in `` Diner'' and `` Footloose,'' is on the screen in almost every frame of the film. In one scene, <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> sits outside the church with his best man, who tries to tempt him not to get married. The struggle, <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> says, was to win the audience's sympathy, despite the fact that his character is on the brink of jilting the beautiful <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON>. `` I really wanted him to seem like a little boy in a monkey suit, and that was difficult,'' <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>'s travails were more subtle. Her character, <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON>, appears bland. But she's not, said the actress. <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON> is `` very strong, although she does n't necessarily appear on the surface to be strong,'' said <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, who first drew attention in the industry with her portrayal of <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s girlfriend in 1980 in the Academy Award-winning `` Ordinary People. The next year, she had a supporting actress <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> nomination for her role in `` Ragtime.'' `` She's a person you would n't ever think twice about,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said. But before the end of the movie, `` The door opens on her soul and you see how much there is she has to offer.'' Both actors lauded <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' direction. `` As strong and independent as I come off on the set, I need a director who will say, ` OK, that's good, you got it,''' <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> did that for him. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> agreed. `` I always felt supported and I always knew that he would guide me.'' By the end of the filming, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> trusted <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> to improvise. One touching and funny result has <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> trying natural childbirth methods _ massaging his abdomen and panting _ while <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON> gives birth in another room. `` By that point I'd been playing this character so many times and in so many different situations that I really felt that I knew him and <PERSON> John </PERSON> knew him. ... And he just kind of said, ` We'll turn the camera on and you just hang out in the room and do what you would do.'' The tension <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> has felt in front of the camera in other movies did n't apply in this one, he said. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> sort of blows all that tension right out of the water,'' by letting the camera roll during retakes instead of shouting, `` Action!'' or `` Cut!'' a lot. The atmosphere during filming was relaxed enough for <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> to bring along his dog, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, whom he calls `` a <LOCATION> Labrador </LOCATION> deceiver'' _ a mutt that's part Lab. <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> and <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> are both accomplished on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stage, and are used to feeding on the energy of an audience. But in a way, <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said, the director filled that function. `` When he was looking at me he would see <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON>, he would n't see <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>,'' she said.

<HEAD>French Philosophers Debate Heidegger's Nazi Past</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The normally staid community of French philosophers is in an uproar over the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON>, the late West German whose philosophy had a wide following in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Specialists have long known that <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON>, whose classic `` Being and Time'' in 1927 influenced a whole generation of existentialist philosophers, was once a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It has not been clear just how deep his fascist sympathies ran, or how his disciples contributed _ knowingly or unknowingly _ to protecting his reputation. <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON>, one of the ranking philosophers of the 20th century, has been a particularly dominant figure in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where his writings helped shape the thought of <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartre </PERSON> and other thinkers. Twelve years after his death, his standing is now threatened by the mushrooming controversy, which focuses on the question: Were Heidegger's <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> ties a matter of opportunism, self-preservation and a weak character _ or a poisonous reflection of his lifelong belief in the superiority of the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people, language and culture? The book `` Heidegger and Nazism'' by <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Farias </PERSON>, a Chilean philosopher and former student of <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freiburg </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, goes far beyond anything previously published about the German thinker. <PERSON> Farias </PERSON> found documents indicating that <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON> was a card-carrying, dues-paying member of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> until 1945, the year World War II ended. He argues that <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON> acted not out of circumstance or opportunism, but out of a commitment to the principles of National Socialism: elitism, discrimination and anti-Semitism. He further maintains that <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON> resigned as rector of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freiburg </ORGANIZATION> in 1934 not because official university policy was pro-Nazi, but because it was too moderate. <PERSON> Farias </PERSON> says others later became the official party ideologues at the university only because <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON> was considered too radical. While reaction to <PERSON> Farias </PERSON>' book has been loud and varied, French philosophers are perhaps most troubled by the idea that <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON>'s Nazi beliefs are the underpinnings of his thought <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedier </PERSON>, a devoted Heideggerian, called Ferias' book a `` shameless falsification'' and accused the author of `` tampering with documents.'' <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON> `` was not a hero, but neither was he the partisan activist and anti-Semitic denouncer of Jews who emerges from the imaginary portrait painted by <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Farias </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fedier </PERSON> wrote in the latest issue of <PERSON> Debat </PERSON>, a philosophy journal. <PERSON> Fedier </PERSON> did not deny <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON>'s attraction to Nazism, but called it merely a `` serious error in judgment. <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON> did not see how dangerous <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was. He let himself be fooled.'' In two recently published books, the French deconstructionist <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrida </PERSON> traced the links between Heideggerian thought and Nazism. Critics praised the strength of <PERSON> Derrida </PERSON>'s analysis, but said he did not go far enough. `` One would have liked to see <PERSON> Derrida </PERSON> ... express his own moral indignation,'' wrote <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maggiori </PERSON> in the newspaper Liberation. `` Why be so polite? Why does <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON>'s work, like a sword, command its victim's respect?'' <PERSON> Farias </PERSON> is less polite. He devotes a chapter to <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON>'s first essay, written in 1910, which extols the virtues of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> a <LOCATION> Sancta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, a 17th century Viennese monk known for his virulent anti-Semitism and xenophobia. `` Important people like <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> a <LOCATION> Sancta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> should remain alive in our hearts, working silently in the soul of the people,'' <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON> wrote then. <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON> discussed <PERSON> Sancta </PERSON> <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> again in 1964 and was no less laudatory. <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON>'s later work denounced dehumanization in modern society. Yet, as <PERSON> Farias </PERSON> and others, including <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacoue-Labarthe </PERSON>, point out, he never denounced the Holocaust or uttered a single word of sorrow or regret over the death of millions of Jews. `` Heidegger's irreparable mistake was his silence on The Extermination,'' <PERSON> Blanchot </PERSON> wrote in a letter published in <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Nouvel </PERSON> <PERSON> Observateur </PERSON>, a French weekly. The controversy has also spread to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Farias </PERSON> is a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. His book appeared first in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> only after being rejected twice by West German publishers. The liberal weekly <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamburg </ORGANIZATION>, in a recent article on the furor, describes <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON> as a `` scared opportunist,'' and `` not the hero type,'' but says he was not an anti-Semite and questions whether he `` thought as a Nazi, acted as a Nazi, philosophically justified the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> business.'' The affair has had a much higher profile in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, perhaps because <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON> has not been as influential a figure in postwar German thought as he has been in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. In 1934, <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON> was photographed wearing a Nazi badge and was quoted as saying, `` The Fuehrer himself and alone is the present and future German reality.'' For Lacoue-Labarthe, <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON>'s commitment to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialism </ORGANIZATION> is `` absolutely coherent with his thinking.'' In his recent book, `` The Fiction of Politics,'' Lacoue-Labarthe quotes <PERSON> Heidegger </PERSON> as comparing agriculture, `` a motorized food industry,'' to the `` fabrication of cadavers in the gas chambers and extermination camps, the blockade of countries reduced to famine and the building of hydrogen bombs.'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Deguy </PERSON>, a leftist philosopher also writing in <PERSON> Debat </PERSON>, argued that <PERSON> Farias </PERSON>' disclosures have been common knowledge for years. He called the book `` weak conceptually and analytically'' and said it gained attention only through the mass media.

<TEXT>
 In days of economic tension, such as now, bad news tends to land like a bomb, while good news is seen as a mere respite not to be taken too seriously. This explains to some degree why the recent good news has n't caused any great commotion The dollar, so unstable just weeks ago, has settled down. Manufacturers are expanding. Exports are up. The trade deficit has shrunk. But will it continue? That's the question. Today, therefore, was marked on calendars a long time ago as a day to watch, it being the day on which the January <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade figures come out. It could be the day on which good news makes as much noise as the bad. Another indication that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade deficit is improving could convince some cynics that the economy really has turned around. Suggestions of that turn have been dropped bit by bit over the past few weeks and months, but they have been falling soft as snowflakes rather than hard as bombs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing, for example, is out of the doldrums in which it had been stranded for years. Production is rising; output per manhor is up; quality seems to have improved; wage rates have been stable. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports have been improving. The falling dollar was perhaps the one most important factor in the turnaround, since it automatically made American goods less expensive abroad while putting pressure on imports. But the story is more involved than that. For several years <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> producers have been refining their production techniques, refitting plants, paring their payrolls and otherwise making themselves fit for competition. In addition, the attitude of confrontation between labor and management that for decades made battlegrounds of factories has, to a very great degree, evolved into one of cooperation in pursuit of shared goals. In addition, so gradually it has gone almost unnoticed, there is also a greater awareness of exporting by even small companies that, in the 1950s and 1960s, were content to restrict sales to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic market. All this has been occurring without a great deal of bombast by anyone. Day by day, the falling dollar got most of the attention, but the falling dollar would n't have been of much help to exporters if they were n't ready to export. The dollar got much of the attention because it posed dangers as well as advantages. But now the dollar has stabilized at a lower rate; the dangers inherent in its fluctuations are greatly reduced, but the advantage remains. Since the beginning of the year, the exchange value of the dollar has gained 6.6 percent relative to the Japanese yen, 8.4 percent against the West German mark and 6.9 percent against a basket of 10 major foreign currencies. Until the dollar stopped falling, fears existed that foreigners would sour on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments, call their money home and undermine <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks, bonds and real estate. That threat now has been greatly reduced. If at the same time the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can continue to raise exports and lower imports, the good news probably will get the attention it merits, while crisis headlines become the dust of history.

 Happy noises hum down the halls of the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and filter into the paneled office. Principal <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> stops her paperwork to listen attentively. A substantial, gray-haired woman, she seems frozen in her swivel chair as she strains to catch the sounds coming from the classrooms, a buzz of song, recitation and prayer. Relaxing after a moment, she nods approvingly. A smile melts the concentration that had creased her forehead. `` Yes,'' she says. `` It's a good sound, the sound of children learning.'' A bell rings and the halls are filled with children. The girls are immaculately dressed in green plaid jumpers and white blouses. The boys wear green pants, white shirts and black ties. The children have something in common besides the uniforms: All 482 have dark skins. `` Welcome to the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, the only large-scale, all-black, private <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> school I know of,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON>, the 53-year-old founder and driving force behind the school. `` Our motto is ` All things are possible within the Lord.''' The non-profit academy is housed in a one-story brick building atop a hill near downtown <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>. Until 1983, the building was a public elementary school. Progressive Christian is leasing it with an option to buy. `` You're looking at a miracle here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> said proudly as she walked down the hall, past photographs of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>. `` This place was a total wreck when we moved in 18 months ago. Now we're a family. We're also a vital education center that is serving the needs of black children.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> said she came to perceive those needs in the 18 years she was a public schoolteacher and principal. `` It was clear to me that the public school system was n't providing the moral guidance, the loving discipline and the positive self-image reinforcement that many children need in order to flourish,'' she said In the summer of 1985, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> took the plunge with $ 50,000 in savings and loans. She opened a trial summer school at the <LOCATION> Progressive </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, where her husband is pastor. `` We had 75 children and taught remedial reading and math with an emphasis on Christian principles and the development of positive self-esteem,'' she said. `` It was incredible. I began to see a change in those children on a daily basis and so did their parents. They kept telling me their kids were so excited about the school that they did n't even have to get them up in the mornings. `` That fall I quit my job -LRB- as principal of an integrated public magnet school -RRB- and opened this school, which goes from K4 -LRB- pre-kindergarten -RRB- through the eighth grade. We started with 175 students. By the summer of'86, we had 400 students enrolled and had to move out of the church. Now, with 482 students and 38 employees, we've got cramped quarters once again.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> is one of four mostly black private schools, including a tiny class run by Seventh-day Adventists, in <LOCATION> Bibb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Some 5,000 of the county's 30,000 school-age children attend private schools, most of them white. `` Most of our children came to us from the public schools, where many were doing poorly,'' she said. `` They were developing poor self-images and their parents were afraid their children were going to be lost.'' <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, a sixth-grader, feels he was one such student. `` I was a little mouse. I was so scared I just could n't speak up,'' he recalled of his three years in public school. `` I had a white teacher in the first grade who told my parents I was retarded. She and the kids used to make fun of me. Now I'm on the honor roll, and I know I'm not retarded.'' Other students said they had to work harder at <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and had fewer social and athletic activities yet still preferred their private school to public classrooms. `` The kids here are n't as mad as they were in public school,'' said <PERSON> Latonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Raines </PERSON>, an eighth-grader. `` And the teachers really seem to care about you here.'' <LOCATION> Bibb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, who worked to integrate the county's schools two decades ago, said he found the present situation ironic. `` I've got two grandchildren in Mrs. <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON>'s school, including a grandson who was n't doing well in public school,'' <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> said. `` My grandson is doing much better now that he's in the private school.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> said her school, in addition to providing a Christian atmosphere, gives the children positive role models. `` They get to see black people in charge,'' she said. `` We also strive to instill in them the belief that everybody is somebody special. We stress the worth of the individual.'' She said her school also accommodates the students' special needs and schedules. `` For one thing, she said, `` we're open from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m., which especially helps single parents. We provide a warm, loving atmosphere, but we also stress academics and have volunteer tutors for high-risk failures. Then, too, we supervise the homework of those students who stay after school.'' She said the parents pay $ 30 a week for one child and $ 50 for two or more. They must provide books, uniforms and lunches for their children. Several mothers, interviewed as a group, agreed they were thrilled with the school even though tuition money is hard to spare. `` My little boy is happy now. There has n't been a day he has n't gotten up and gotten himself ready for school Morning can be an especially tense time for a single parent, and I simply ca n't tell you how much this means to me,'' said <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coggins </PERSON>, a Social Security claims examiner with two children at the school. Mrs. <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> said parents of eighth-graders want her to offer high school classes so children wo n't have to return to public school. `` I'm also getting requests from parents outside the area to start a boarding school,'' she added. `` I'd like to do that, but first we need to raise enough money to pay off our bills and complete our library, which we need to do to be fully accredited.'' The school now has provisional accreditation and plans a library fund-raising drive. `` I feel certain these things will all come in time. Meanwhile, I must be doing something right. It's all I can do, when I go out in the hall, not to get knocked down by all the hugs I get.''

 Wary of the turbulent public school system and seeking the best possible academic environment for their 5-year-old son, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dade </PERSON> enrolled the boy in private school. The Dades were one of many families who last year chose private schools over the <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which was beginning a vast desegregation plan involving crosstown busing and the reassignment of students and teachers to achieve racial balance. White flight has been a problem in the district for some time. But the Dades are black. The <PERSON> Dades </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, attends <ORGANIZATION> McGraw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Learning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the only black private school in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. `` We wanted a positive, strong school, and basically a black school that was strong in academics,'' <PERSON> Dade </PERSON> said. `` Before, we had taken our son to other schools and they did n't seem to have the care and, really, the motivation that it took. Because my son was brought up in a more mixed environment, more whites than blacks, we thought it was time to have the reverse, as well as have a good academic background.'' The <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> school has built a reputation for academic excellence since beginning as a preschool day-care facility in 1982. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> founded the school in a converted grocery store near downtown soon after earning a doctorate in socio-linguistics at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` I thought it was a necessity,'' said Ms. <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON>, an English professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. `` For about 20 years I've taught on the college level and it has been my experience that many black students do not use the language well, even after 12 years of schooling. They do not feel good about themselves and generally ... most of them need something that has been lacking in the school systems.'' In the beginning, most of the pupils were the children of Ms. <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON>'s students at college. About 60 students, mostly children of business and professional people, now attend the institute. More than half are preschoolers, the rest in kindergarten through third grade. The institute is certified by the state to teach through sixth grade and has a long waiting list. Students are taught basic reading, writing, mathematics, geography, science, music and dance, and learn French as well as English. Special emphasis also is placed on language development and computer training. As important to most of the students' parents, Ms. <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> said, are the lessons their children are taught in cultural awareness and social skills and the experience they get in being where blacks are the majority. `` A very crucial and important part of our curricula is to be sure that these young people have good feelings about themselves and their people,'' Ms. <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> said. `` Most often, we are told very little about how we happened to be where we are. At this school.. we teach young people parts of African and Afro-American history that can make them feel good about themselves. That, I know, they do n't get anywhere else. `` These little folk come from a people that has been greatly neglected in this society, so they need some special kind of emphasis to make them know that they are really something awfully great,'' she said. `` I think that's what we give them.'' The school is not for everyone, Ms. <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> conceded. Many families can not afford the tuition and fees, which total about $ 2,650 annually for the 12-month program. The school has several pupils of mixed race, and one white child attends the after-school program. But its mostly black enrollment and its emphasis on black culture have discouraged some black parents, Ms. <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> said. `` Many black parents ... have been conditioned to believe that things can not be good if they -LRB- their children -RRB- are not mixed with white,'' she said. The small enrollment enables the school's five full-time and two part-time teachers to give extra attention to individual students, the one feature cited most by parents who enroll their children at <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> described her 5-year-old son, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, as `` a slower learner'' who has to be motivated. `` He needs to be pushed. Some teachers' classrooms -LRB- at public schools -RRB- are overcrowded, and they do n't take the time that they need to take to push our kids,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. `` That's my reason for sending him here.'' <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins-Robinson </PERSON> said her daughter was further advanced academically than some other 4-year-olds but was not getting the educational base she needed at another school. `` At <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON>, she's already reading and knows phonetics, numbers, alphabets. The way the teachers here have worked with her, she knows now that she can read almost anything.'' Several students who got their early academic training at <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> have advanced rapidly in the public school system. One, 7-year-old <PERSON> Khiela </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, ranked in the top 1 percent in the nation in mathemathics on a national standardized test she took a year ago. On average, first-graders in the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> district ranked at the 57th percentile among first-graders nationwide who took the Metropolitan Achievement Test in the 1986-87 school year, accordiing to <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Tadlock </PERSON>, a district evaluation and testing specialist. <PERSON> Khiela </PERSON> completed kindergarten at 5 -LCB-, had gone through the first-grade math program within two months of her first year at public school and was doing third-grade math work by the time she reached second grade. She also excelled in reading, English and science. `` Khiela started at <ORGANIZATION> McGraw </ORGANIZATION> at 2 -LCB- and stayed there through 5 -LCB-. We feel that a lot of her ability now is attributable to what <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> did,'' said her father, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>. `` All those years, she had one-on-one attention, she excelled in all her studies and she enjoyed what she was doing. `` That's the key,'' he said. `` They made her feel confident in what she was doing. She felt good about herself.'' A study by the Urban League of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> concluded that black students in the state have not achieved in school at a competitive rate, and it questioned whether they receive adequate early academic preparation in public schools. `` Without appropriate preparation during early school years, the future academic achievement of black students is left to chance,'' it said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON>, author of the study, said the <PERSON> McGraw </PERSON> school is a good alternative, particularly for younger students, to public schools, which he said are largely insensitive to the needs of blacks. That the school is predominantly black and emphasizes black culture is not inconsistent with desegregation efforts, said <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. `` In fact, they're probably doing more in addressing the issues of a multiracial society,'' he said.

 When former Congressman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> arrives at a scenic <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> farm for a photo opportunity, the farmer chides him _ `` Are you my 10:30? You're late!'' All along the crowded <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> campaign trail, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, is constantly bumping into the other candidates _ <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. They play themselves. All make cameo appearances in the premiere episode of <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>'s new series `` Tanner'88: The Dark Horse,'' making its debut tonight, just in time for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. The next episode will be aired in March. The limited-run series is a collaboration between director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> and cartoonist <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>. They have created a fictional presidential candidate, surrounded him with a loyal staff and will follow his progress through the 1988 presidential campaign. At one point in the first episode, set in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> T.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavanaugh </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pamela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, complains to the artsy filmmaker who produced the candidate's video biography, `` <PERSON> Deke </PERSON>, if you use the term ` neo-realism' one more time ...'' Neo-realism is, in fact, the term that springs to mind when describing the series, reminiscent of both `` Medium Cool,'' <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON> <PERSON> Wexler </PERSON>'s 1969 quasi-documentary on the 1968 Democratic Convention, and `` The Candidate,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>'s 1972 film starring <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> as a reluctant Mr. <PERSON> Clean </PERSON> drafted to run for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But `` Tanner'' is mostly a reflection of <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, himself an early innovator in `` neo-realism.'' His `` <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>'' and `` The Wedding'' broke new ground in filmmaking with improvised dialogue and their unflinching examinations of American morality. <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>, of course, put politics on the funny pages with `` Doonesbury,'' and `` <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>'' gives him a vast new forum for political satire and commentary. Between the two of them, <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> have created a searingly insightful dramatization that could shed more light on the 1988 election process than any number of network commentators and newspaper columnists. In episode one, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> and his staff arrive in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to find a state full of jaded, media-wise voters who cringe at the thought of another candidacy, even though <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> is good-looking, likable, competent and well-intentioned. The premise of his candidacy is that since <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> dropped out of the race, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> has stepped in as the `` generational'' candidate, the only one among the lot, he says, who can say without thinking which Beatle was his favorite. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> gave up his <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> congressional seat in the 1970s, because his daughter had cancer. He's now divorced. His daughter, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, has long since recovered and is helping with the campaign. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> did poorly in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> with barely enough momentum to rent a seedy motel room and buy a few pizzas for volunteers. The only news media interest in him consists of a lone <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> reporter doing a series of psychological profiles of the candidates. When <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>'s campaign film is shown to a test group of voters, they hoot at its undraped sentimentality. There's hope, though. They react favorably to the candidate himself. It's when the film seeks to manipulate them that they get turned off. `` It could be the process itself,'' says the media consultant. `` It's tedious. It's long. What they may be resisting is another candidacy.'' While the media consultant tries to figure out how to sell the candidate, <PERSON> T.J. </PERSON> is contending with phone calls from <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> who apparently is trying to get her to help his own campaign. `` Do n't hang that on me,'' she says at one point in the one-sided conversation `` That was a victory party. I was drunk and that was just a figure of speech.'' After a depressing day of campaigning, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> returns exhausted to the motel _ where a mystery woman is waiting for him _ and stops by the campaign office. There the campaign filmmaker surreptitiously captures, in red-hot cinema verite, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>'s unrehearsed but eloquent tirade on patriotism. The campaign's new slogan: `` <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> _ For Real.'' On to Super Tuesday.

 Sportswriter <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> popularized the phrase `` dead - solid perfect'' to describe a well-struck golf shot, and he wanted just that quality in the movie of his novel about a Cinderella barmaid named <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> `` I like this one,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> says of `` <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>,'' which Home Box Office will premiere this Saturday. When <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' pro football novel `` Semi-Tough'' was made into a <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> movie in 1977, most of the book had disappeared. `` The adaptation of ` <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>' is 500 times more faithful than what happened to ` Semi-Tough.' It was great having a producer and director busting their chops to make it more faithful,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> says. `` <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>,'' which is another way of saying <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, tells how <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchins </PERSON>, who works in <ORGANIZATION> Herb </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Grill </ORGANIZATION>, finds true love with a guy named <PERSON> Slick </PERSON> and happiness as a country singer.

In addition, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Emmylou </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wills </PERSON> appear as themselves. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Krige </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>. The movie was filmed mostly on location in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with more than 2,000 extras used in the scenes filmed at <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a huge honky tonk in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON>'s song of `` Baja Oklahoma'' was in the book, as was her hero, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>'s an old friend,'' said <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. `` I've known him for 20 years. I called him up and asked him if he'd write the music for it. We went up to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, where he was working, and he wrote the music for two verses in 10 minutes. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> says, ` It ai n't `` Stardust,'' but it ai n't bad.' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> has lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for more than 25 years, but looks and sounds like he just came in from his hometown of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He still has a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> drawl, he's tall and still has most of his youthful slimness, but his hair is white and thinning on top. With his cigarette, he could be a slightly over-the-hill Marlboro Man. His wife, June, operates Mexican restaurants in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> named <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON>'s after the heroine of `` <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> spent 23 years as a senior writer at Sports Illustrated, then left in 1984 to write a weekly syndicated column and columns for Sports Digest and <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> magazines. He's also written four novels, `` Semi-Tough,'' `` Dead Solid Perfect,'' `` <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>,'' `` Life Its Ownself'' and `` Limo,'' co-authored with <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrake </PERSON>. A fifth, tentatively titled `` Do n't Write Me Nothing That Rhymes,'' a period comedy about the newspaper business, is near completion. `` I write comedy romances,'' he said, adding with a grin: `` I write novels to support my journalism habit. Journalism's my first love. It keeps you alert. I love novels, but writing news is my real love.'' One of his three children, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, is a sportswriter for the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>'' has been through several typewriters on its way to becoming a movie. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierson </PERSON> wrote the first two screenplays. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tewkesbury </PERSON> wrote another version. `` Then I got a call from producer <PERSON> Marykay </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> asking me to write the screenplay,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` It was going to be a theatrical picture with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> directing and <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON> playing <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON>. It would have been a different movie, more of a big comedy. Now it's more of a love story, but we keep some of the comedy. `` Given all the compromises you have to make adapting a novel to the screen, it was a good experience. It made me like <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> again.'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> believes he can finish his latest book in about another month. `` It's set in the 1930s and'40s, so I've had to do a lot of research,'' he said. `` I wanted everything to be accurate. If somebody's talking about something in the news, I want it to be right. It's got a lot of old radio stuff, too, and that's all accurate. I'm a radio freak.''

<HEAD>Economic Outlook May Be Deteriorating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A small-business survey released today indicates inflation could become a worsening problem during 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, which studies responses from more than 2,000 member firms each quarter, said `` a trend toward more frequent and larger price increases has become quite evident.'' While signs of economic deterioration were n't sharply defined in the latest study, the inflation component jumped sharply, said Professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, who interprets the findings. <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s school of business, said 27 percent of all companies in the survey said they plan to raise prices, a 6 percentage point jump from the previous survey and the highest level in several years. The sharp rise in price expectations among respondents is considered significant for the economy as a whole, since the small-business community produces about 50 percent of the nation's gross private product In spite of the negative implications of the inflation component _ and despite expressions of doubt about the economy's future _ the survey showed businesses plan to spend on equipment, inventory and additional jobs. Such spending plans, said <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, appear inconsistent with a rise in negative opinions about future business conditions. Each year since 1985, he said, the percentage of companies expecting a worsening of conditions rises, while the number anticipating better markets shrinks. Simultaneously, those declaring it to be a good time to expand fell to just 13 percent of all companies, a four-year January low. `` Apparently, many believe the law of gravity applies to economic statistics as well as to apples,'' he said, explaining that the longer the recovery continues, the greater is the percentage believing it will end. Negative and positive variations in the January report left the small-business optimism index almost unchanged at 101.8 seasonally adjusted, compared with 102.3 in the previous quarter. The index, which sets 1978 as its base, is made up of responses to 10 questions, including expected business conditions, current job openings, plans for capital outlays, expected credit conditions, and changes in net earnings. The latest reading of the optimism index, which was begun in late 1974, compares with an all-time high of 108.7 in January 1984, and an all-time low of 81.1 in the second quarter of 1980. Except for brief dips in the final quarters of 1985 and 1986, the index has exceeded 100 in every survey since early 1983. Some highlights of the components include: _ Employment _ Strongest hiring plans since 1978 Nineteen percent of companies plan to increase employment in the next three months, while 5 percent plan net reductions. Job openings reached a new high for the expansion, with 23 percent reporting unfilled positions. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the percentage was 42 percent. New hiring plans were strongest in manufacturing, with 28 percent planning increases and only 8 percent planning workforce reductions. _ Interest Rates _ Average interest rates paid by small companies held at 11.1 percent in the fourth quarter of the year Fifty percent of all short-term loans were tied to the prime rate. _ Prices _ There are indications, <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> said, that inflation could be worse than generally anticipated `` Based on plans to raise prices, non-food inflation should begin to pick up, heading toward the 5 percent level.'' Commenting on the decline in business expectations, <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> said `` if this view produces a caution in spending on the part of more and more decisionmakers, the economy can not help but slip.'' The big exception to this, he added, is if foreigners `` become exceptionally aggressive buyers of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. goods.''

<HEAD>America's Most Distinguished Living Playwright</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One evening last fall, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most distinguished living playwright stood on a bare stage at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Theater Center and read to an audience whose reverence overflowed in explosions of laughter, sighs and standing ovations. This sold-out promotion for his autobiography, `` Timebends: A Life'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Grove </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, $ 24.95 -RRB-, demonstrated <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s enduring popularity with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> theatergoers who remember `` Death of a Salesman'' and `` The Crucible'' _ an audience he fears is becomming extinct. `` Maybe it's a minority art at this point,'' he says of his great love, the theater. `` That does n't mean it's less valuable. The masses are n't always right.'' Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had reflected on the travails of the American theater and his own unhealed wounds from years of critical attack. He voiced with some reticence his perception that the media collaborated in the destruction of his second wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. And, although he is at work on another play, he expressed hesitation at re-entering the often brutal arena of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theater. `` The prospect of battling the theater again is not something I look forward to,'' he said. `` When I began, the theater was the most exciting of media. It was full of adventure, social protest and the new discoveries of -LRB- theater teacher and director <PERSON> Constantin </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Stanislavsky </PERSON>. Some of the best actors were involved in theater rather than the movies.'' What changed that, he surmises, was an escalating standard of living which pushed ticket prices out of the reach of the average person, and a new breed of critics who did n't understand. `` The Crucible,'' was shrugged off by reviewers when it opened in 1953, he said. `` That makes me wonder what else is being shrugged off.'' A sturdy, energetic 72, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> has found a new fascination in book writing. His next project may be a novel. His 599-page autobiography offers a rich pastiche of memories from his depression era childhood, from his painful marriage to the most famous movie star in the world and his equally painful confrontation with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Un-American Activities Committee. Some reviewers have questioned the rambling form of `` Timebends'' which follows no particular chronological order. But <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, with characteristic confidence, sees it as a breakthrough. `` I believe the form of this book is new and it fascinates me. ... The book is written the way we rememeber, not the way movies used to show it by flipping calender pages backwards, and not as a hurdler going over hurdles one after the other,'' he says. `` We remember in connected images. The mind has no sense of time as far as the emotional life is concerned. Time is liquid in this book, like a wave that rolls over on itself. I'm bending time.'' Dredging up memories of his four-year marriage to <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> appears to have been difficult. `` Any of the personal relationships are difficult and painful -LRB- to write about -RRB-,'' he says. `` But anything that does n't make the author feel pain is probably not worth writing in the first place. If you're revealing the world, you're revealing yourself.'' There is a revelation of a consuming love which drew him into the unseemly marriage to the actress. `` She was a whirling light to me then,'' he writes, `` all paradox and enticing mystery, street tough one moment, then lifted by a lyrical and poetic sensitivity that few retain past early adolescence. `` I was in a swift current, there was no stopping or handhold, she was finally all that was true.'' There is some self-criticism by <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> for failing to save the actress from her own demons. But more often, he blames her demise on others: the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> hierarchy of directors, acting coaches and gossip columnists who fed the <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> myth but denigrated her efforts to become a serious actress. His hardest jibes are at the press which dogged her during their marriage and, in his opinion, conspired to portray her in the most unflattering light possible. `` I do n't blame the press,'' he says. `` The press can collaborate in harming somebody, but they do n't do it singlehandedly. She was frustrated by the press. She wanted to be taken more seriously and every time she tried to pick herself up off the floor they would then kick her in the face. An actor is at the mercy of the press.'' He is asked whether <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, a sex symbol in a pre-feminist era, might have fared better today. `` Yes, I think so,'' he says. `` She was a victim of the hypocrisy of the'50s. It was hard not to be. But the hypocrisy continues. The tears keep being shed by people who did their best to destroy her.'' Of his own life, so eloquently recounted in `` Timebends,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> says he has few regrets. `` I'm very fatalistic about it. It's not that there's a mystical fate, but one's character determines one's fate. I simply created this life of mine the same as your handwriting is yours and ca n't be different ... We do make our lives and we're free to choose in one way or another.''

<DATELINE>PUSHKAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This town of cobblestone streets and sparkling white houses is a long way from anywhere in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, but millions cross a desert every year to get to it and wash away their sins in its holy lake. <PERSON> Pushkar </PERSON> is a place revered by Hindus and even by some foreigners who seek out its tranquility. Its beginnings lie with <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON>, the creator of the universe in Hindu mythology. Hindu texts have it that when <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON> was seeking a place for a holy ceremony, he chose <PERSON> Pushkar </PERSON>. He dropped a lotus from his hand and water spouted from the desert to form a lake, according to the texts that date from the 8th century B.C. In these modern times, as the sun rises, <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> pilgrims chant mantras and take a dip in <LOCATION> Pushkar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, believing all their sins will be washed away by the holy waters. Europeans and Americans often are seen by the lake, sharing the religious experience. They feed grain to pigeons and sweets to long-tailed monkeys who scramble across the pinnacles of the town's 400 temples where ascetics, Hindu monks and other holy men gather <PERSON> Pushkar </PERSON>, a town of 9,000 people, is an oasis of tranquility, far removed from the bustling cities and teeming slums of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>. The blazing sun soaks into everything. It was the sacred month of <PERSON> Kartik </PERSON>, signifying the onset of winter, when <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON> is said to have dropped his lotus blossom. <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON>, foremost in the Hindu trinity of supreme gods, had been looking for a suitable site to perform a major religious ceremony. But his wife, <PERSON> Savitri </PERSON>, could not attend the ritual. Angered, she decreed that henceforth <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON> would be worshiped at only one place. <PERSON> Pushkar </PERSON> became the sole earthly home of the peaceful god of creation, while millions of shrines were erected across <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to Lord Shiva the destroyer and to ferocious goddesses like <PERSON> Kali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Durga </PERSON> who are often depicted as fire-spitting images carrying heads of evil men they had slain in battle. But this oasis in the desert emerged as a major holy town for the Hindus, almost equal in importance to <ORGANIZATION> Benaras </ORGANIZATION>, the `` eternal city.'' Hindus believe that one goes to heaven if one dies in <LOCATION> Benaras </LOCATION>. Pilgrims come by the thousands to <LOCATION> Pushkar </LOCATION>, 250 miles southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, to bathe in the lake and revive the memory of <PERSON> Brahma </PERSON>'s majestic rite every year on <PERSON> Kartik </PERSON> <PERSON> Poornima </PERSON>, the full moon night in the month of November. Shielded by <PERSON> Nag </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahar </PERSON>, or <ORGANIZATION> Serpent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pushkar </PERSON> has <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s _ and perhaps the world's _ only temple to <LOCATION> Brahma </LOCATION> The town centers on the lake, where there are several steps for bathing. Signs warn foreigners `` not to wear shorts and other revealing clothes, not to smoke, drink near the lake or take photographs, not to kiss, embrace or indulge in other irreverent acts.'' The steps, called ghats, are controlled by vigilant and aggressive brahmin priests, who preside over religious ceremonies, armed with horoscopes. They watch every pilgrim approaching the lake and pounce on potential clients. Each visit is recorded in their bulky, cloth-covered books. A priest can easily tell a devotee when his grandfather visited <PERSON> Pushkar </PERSON> by referring to the dog-eared notebooks. Displeasing a priest can be unpleasant. He will pronounce curses on one's entire family, naming all _ the grandfather, father and sons. From the lake, the steps lead up to the main street, a favorite shopping center with the tourists. The shops are stacked with exotic handicrafts, peasant skirts and other clothes native to this part of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Velvet shirts and pajamas, musts for low-budget travelers, hang in vibrant displays.

<DATELINE>GARY, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, the preacher's wife, delivered the prophecy at a noon prayer meeting late in December: `` The Lord said he was going to send a tornado, and many shall die,'' she recalls, saying <PERSON> God </PERSON> spoke through her during the prayer service. `` He was going to send his fury and vengeance on the people.'' So 17 faithful members of the Repairer of the <ORGANIZATION> Breach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> in Christ gathered at their small westside church _ a converted two-story frame house _ on Jan. 3 to await the wrath of God. The congregation has been waiting, faithfully, peacefully, ever since. Any day now, any moment, members believe, <PERSON> God </PERSON> will send a tornado spinning down from the heavens to smite the wicked and spare the righteous. And spare their church. Their number includes a school teacher, a recent college graduate, a college freshman, and a restaurant worker with a management degree. They have sacrificed jobs and education, as well as the respect of family and friends who question their sanity. The congregation has been challenged by the power of the state, too. Five members have been removed under court order _ though two of them have returned since undergoing forced psychiatric examinations. Two children were taken from their mother and returned to school, and a 51-year-old man was ordered to undergo kidney dialysis treatment. But unlike a Mormon polygamist clan in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> whose recent resistance of police ended in a shootout that killed one officer, these religious fundamentalists have quietly accepted the intrusions. `` We're not against the court,'' says M.L. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, the church elder and preacher, the husband of <PERSON> Annie </PERSON>. `` If God allows it to happen, then that's it.'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, 36, says he's also lost the support of national church headquarters in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, which ordered him to take down a sign proclaiming affiliation. `` Until the Lord says to move it, it's going to be up,'' he says. A woman who answered a call at the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> headquarters said no one was available to discuss the matter. Despite the challenges from outsiders, <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> and the church members welcome visitors and talk freely. All profess an unshakeable belief in the tornado. None say they want to leave. The 39-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> first prophesied the tornado would strike Jan. 3, then Jan. 24. Both dates passed uneventfully. The <PERSON> Simses </PERSON> now say God delayed the tornado to gain time to spread the warning. No new date has been set. `` It'll be pretty soon,'' says <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>. `` It's nationally known now.'' No one's faith is shaken by the delay, or by meteorological precedent. `` Tornadoes can occur anytime, but most of the tornadoes in this area occur from March through June, and then again late in the fall,'' said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecaster <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowery </PERSON>, who says he ca n't recall a midwinter tornado ever striking the area. Religion professor <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivelle </PERSON>, chairman of the department at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, says apocalyptic visions are common religious themes. `` Of course there are always reasons why the end never comes,'' he said. `` I always tell my students that religion is not logic, and you can not put logical questions to that.'' One of those waiting in the church, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, a 24-year-old graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Grinnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> with a major in Spanish, said, `` There's no doubt in my mind, or in anyone's mind that it's going to come.'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> stopped showing up for his bank teller's job after Jan. 3, then called the bank to explain. `` They did n't really understand it,'' he said. `` But after the tornado comes they'll understand, and they'll congratulate us for standing up for the Lord.'' The family of <PERSON> Ruschell </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> school teacher, and her 16-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Jeanetta </PERSON>, won the court order compelling the two to undergo psychiatric evaluation. `` Really, at the time, they felt I was so deeply under the influence of pastor that we could n't do our own thinking,'' she said. `` If I believe something, and it's different from what you believe, does that make me insane and you not?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said she and her daughter returned voluntarily to the church after a psychiatrist found them competent. `` I'm 47 years old. I've been teaching for 20 years. I've taken my daughter out of school,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> indignantly. `` Do you think I would be here if I did n't believe it?'' <PERSON> Jeanetta </PERSON> says it does n't matter she's missing out on school. `` It does n't bother me because after the tornado, the school may not be there.'' A court gave custody of <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' two sons, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 13, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, 12, to a brother, who will return them to school. Child welfare authorities took the children from the church. `` I do n't fight that. They're just doing their job,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. `` They do n't understand, because this is spiritual.'' The days are occupied with informal services, talking and just waiting. `` Praise God, because this world is coming to an end, and we want to be right,'' chanted <PERSON> Elder </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> during one service. `` People say we're strange, they say we're crazy, that we're crackpots,'' he intones, mopping sweat from his face with a towel thrown around his beefy shoulders. `` But we're just doing what <PERSON> God </PERSON> says to do.'' `` Better be so ready, you may not know the day,'' sings the congregation, now a choir whose voice reverberates off bright blue-painted plaster walls. There is no television or radio in the church, and no newspapers. Adult members take turns preparing meals in the fully equipped kitchen, and the teen-agers clean up. The <PERSON> Simses </PERSON> live upstairs. At night, the others fold up the metal chairs and spread out bedding. The cramped quarters are part of the sacrifice. `` We've all sacrificed here,'' says 18-year-old <PERSON> Falease </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemon </PERSON>, who dropped out of <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Univerity </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> campus. `` God is going to pay us in return.'' <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, the preacher's 18-year-old daughter, says the waiting will be ended soon. `` We'll be out there after the tornado,'' she says. `` Then the world will be a better place to live, with everybody doing <PERSON> God </PERSON>'s will.

<TEXT>
 The second wave of Oscar hype and hoopla begins this week when nominations for the 60th Academy Awards are announced with as many publicists attending as press. `` Broadcast News,'' `` The Last Emperor,'' `` Moonstruck'' and `` Hope and Glory'' seem certain to place high in the Wednesday nominations, judging from critics' awards and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> consensus. The early-morning announcement will be held at the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. While reporters phone in stories to their news organizations, publicists will telephone their clients and bosses with the good or bad news and return to their offices to plot the second phase of the Oscar campaign. `` Campaigning'' is a dirty word in the industry, but most people in the movie business do it. `` We do n't like it, but we ca n't stop it,'' sighs <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>. The Academy expressed its feelings in a message to members in the reminder list of eligible releases: `` You will be importuned by advertisement, promotional gifts and other lobbying tactics, in an attempt to influence your vote. Each year these crude and excessive solicitations embarrass the Academy, embarrass you and demean the significance of the Academy Award.'' Yet this year's campaign appears as intense as ever with estimates of the total cost run as high as $ 5 million. `` I do n't know how much attention is paid -LRB- to the campaigns -RRB- by the voters,'' <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said. `` Not much, I suspect. I know they have no influence on my vote; I rely solely on my own judgment. `` I think the campaigns are justified only to call attention to a good film that has been released early in the year. That's the only way I'm influenced. I read about ` The Tin Men,' which was released earlier in l987, and I said to myself, ` Yeah, that was a good picture.''' `` You ca n't influence Academy members,'' said <PERSON> Booker </PERSON> <PERSON> McClay </PERSON>, who has directed campaigns for <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> for the past dozen years. `` These are professionals who have spent years in the business and seen thousands of films. You ca n't hustle them. `` The main goal is to get the voters to see your picture. You do everything possible so they can see it at their convenience.'' <PERSON> McClay </PERSON>'s big push this year is for Universal's prestige film, `` Cry Freedom,'' which has performed disappointingly at the box office in its limited release. Since November, the film has had 21 special screenings at the studio theater, including those for the actors, writers and directors guilds. Academy members can also show membership cards for admission at theaters showing `` Cry Freedom.'' Tri-Star Pictures took extreme measures to insure exposure for `` Gaby,'' a film about a handicapped woman. It has been praised by the critics but has failed to attract an audience. `` We really, really love the film,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> publicity vice president for Tri-Star. `` We felt we needed to do something special to make it more available for Academy members. So we sent out 2,500 cassettes of ` Gaby.''' This is believed to be a first-time event for a film that is still in theatrical release. The most visible form of campaigning is advertising in the Hollywood Reporter and <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION>. Every winter the trade papers bulge with ads proclaiming films and filmmakers `` for your consideration.'' One publicist estimates the cost per page at $ 5,000, including creative, color printing and space charges. `` Let's face it, the trades are our bibles,'' comments marketing consultant <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Leipzig </PERSON>. `` The question is: How many ads to run? If you run too few, you do n't get consideration. Too many and you're accused of overkill. The voter says, ` They're trying to buy me.''' <PERSON> McClay </PERSON> said Universal ran only 14 ads for `` Out of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' pre-nominations, and the film ended up with the best picture award of 1985. On the other hand, <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> bought 65 ad pages for `` Amadeus,'' the best picture winner for 1984. Publicity plays in important role in Academy campaigns. <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, for example, has recently been on four magazine covers and has appeared on most of the important TV talks shows. All of this brings attention to `` Moonstruck,'' for which she seems certain to be nominated as best actress. `` <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> has been very cooperative,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Flinn </PERSON>, a publicity veteran who is conducting the `` Moonstruck'' campaign for MGM. `` We also brought <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> for a round of interviews. -LRB- Director -RRB- <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewison </PERSON> has done good work for us. Even <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cage </PERSON>, who usually does n't do publicity, has agreed to some college interviews.'' But what does a publicist do when stars wo n't agree to interviews? <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Leipzig </PERSON> faces that problem in his campaign for `` Ironweed.'' Meryl Streep and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> would do no publicity. `` It's a tough, harsh, uncompromising, relentless movie,'' said <PERSON> Leipzig </PERSON> of `` Ironweed,'' which concerns hobo life in 1930s <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. `` Not the kind of movie <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is into this year.'' It's a movie that requires a lot of screenings and not only in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he said. `` I've also arranged screenings for the 100-odd Academy members in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, 20 in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and 15 in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.'' Studios also promote their films with expensive brochures which are mailed to Academy voters. Members of the music branch are inundated with cassettes and albums of songs and scores. After the nominations the campaign continues, but usually with a more dignified tone. `` You've made it this far _ you do n't want to blow it with too much hype,'' cautioned one publicist. `` It never works.''

<HEAD>Europeans Consider Distributing Clean Needles to Slow AIDS</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 With drug abuse blamed for 20 percent of AIDS cases in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, several countries are exploring ways to get clean needles to addicts to slow the spread of the disease. The goal is to help addicts stop sharing needles and cut their risk of passing AIDS to each other and to the general population. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is encouraging national campaigns to reduce needle-sharing as part of its global strategy to combat AIDS. The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> have introduced extensive needle - exchange programs Elsewhere, health authorities are using other approaches to make syringes and needles more widely available to keep addicts from sharing equipment. In <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, for example, addicts _ or anyone else _ can now pick up free syringes and needles at drugstores. After closing hours, they can buy a syringe and two needles for the equivalent of 80 cents from sidewalk dispensing machines. Although male homosexuals have been most at risk from AIDS, drug abusers now account for 20 percent of cases reported to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and 25 percent from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carballo </PERSON>, chief of social and behavioral research for the organization's Global Program on AIDS, said in an interview that there is also evidence that drug-taking by injection is increasing. If AIDS is introduced into the general population of Western countries on a large scale, <PERSON> Carballo </PERSON> said, it will probably be because of drug abuse _ through sexual contact with infected addicts, including prostitutes, and from pregnant women to their babies. In January, AIDS experts from 23 countries met at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters to review ways of dealing with the rise in AIDS among intravenous drug abusers. Among proposals they considered were giving addicts bleach to clean needles, providing washing facilities in drug clinics, information campaigns and needle-exchange programs. <PERSON> Carballo </PERSON> said the main objection to exchange programs was that they could be seen to condone the use of drugs. Under such programs, addicts receive free syringes and needles in exchange for their used ones. At the same time, health authorities offer advice on AIDS and drug treatment. Even though the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has not publicly endorsed needle exchange, <PERSON> Carballo </PERSON> said he favors the idea when combined with efforts to reduce drug-taking. `` If we accept that needle-sharing is one of the primary routes of HIV infection, then it stands to reason that the long-term effect of these programs may well be the cutting down the potential spread of HIV,'' the health official said. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. Intravenous drug users sometimes share needles not only because of short supplies, but also as a social gesture in the way marijuana users pass `` joints.'' <PERSON> Carballo </PERSON> said evidence from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> indicates that exchange programs can reduce needle-sharing, although there is no evidence yet of a reduction in AIDS infection. The Dutch program began in 1984 and is by far the most extensive in the world. It is centered in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, the capital, which is a haven for drug abusers, with an estimated 7,000 addicts. Municipal spokesman <PERSON> Gijs </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Stijgeren </PERSON> said the city distributes 600,000 needles a year. No questions are asked and no names taken. The spokesman said a small proportion of the nation's 400 AIDS patients are drug abusers, adding that the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> program `` doubtlessly has been of great influence'' in slowing the rate of infection. Another contributing factor, however, could be that many heroin addicts in the city prefer smoking the drug to injecting it. The British program began last April as a one-year experiment, with the establishment of 15 needle-exchange clinics in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Results have been uneven. The program has recruited about 2,000 addicts nationwide, and some larger clinics, such as the three in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, are seeing as many as 50 people a day, officials say. But a program set up in <LOCATION> Dundee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, collapsed after six weeks in what was described as an atmosphere of acrimony between health workers and their clients. One addict, in a fit of anger, reportedly sprayed blood from a syringe on a worker. In <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, local residents picketed the clinic for six months, maintaining that it would attract junkies and pushers into their neighborhood. The protests have since died out, and officials say the program is going smoothly. Much attention has been focused on <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, the Scottish capital, which has a notorious problem with hard drugs. Unlike <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where drug abuse accounts for 1 percent of all reported AIDS cases, 60 percent of AIDS carriers in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> are intravenous drug users, and the majority of them live in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinto </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Lothian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS Prevention Team, which is in charge of <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>'s program, said it has been a qualified success. <PERSON> Tinto </PERSON> said the clinic has had 115 clients, including 50 or so regulars, but it has not been able to recruit large numbers because it was set up to be open one afternoon a week and distribute only three needles at a time to each addict. The Monitoring Research Group at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Goldsmiths </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> has produced a confidential report on the British program, and the government will not disclose its findings until the report is studied Dr. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimson </PERSON>, a sociologist who led the research, would not discuss the group's overall assessment but said some of the larger clinics have been very successful in attracting new clients. Major cities in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> launched anonymous needle-exchange programs one year ago. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, a European hard-drug center with an estimated 4,000 addicts, syringes and needles are available free and without prescription from doctors and drugstores. Public reaction to the program has been mild.

 Runza fast-food restaurants have something <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, Burger King and <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s do n't _ cabbage and a cult following. The chain offers hamburgers, french fries and other traditional fast foods, but it's the Runza sandwich that's the staple at Runza Drive-Inns of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Runza _ a mixture of ground beef, cabbage and onion in an oblong loaf of dough _ is available only in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and three neighboring states. But its following is devoted. Ex-Nebraskans living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are known to order several dozen Runzas _ with cheese and Italian variations _ when they hold their `` Taste of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'' parties in the Big Apple. New customers often react with disbelief when they learn that cabbage is a main ingredient in the Runza, says chain chief <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>. `` Ninety percent of the people who do n't like cabbage normally like the product,'' <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> said. `` I say to people, ` If you do n't like it, I'll give you your money back or I'll buy you a hamburger.' <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> apparently shells out few refunds, because his Lincoln-based chain sold about $ 15 million worth of <LOCATION> Runzas </LOCATION> last year at its 42 restaurants in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. Its franchises have reported overall sales increases every year since Runza Drive-Inns of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was incorporated in 1966, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> said. But the <PERSON> Runza </PERSON>'s roots stretch back to 18th-century <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. Germans who were invited to settle in the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> region by <PERSON> Czarina </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> the Great in 1763 developed the Runza or bierock, said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Amen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of Germans from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. A century later, many of the Germans migrated from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> because of a change in Russian leadership. `` Our people, when they came from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, brought the <LOCATION> Runza </LOCATION> with them,'' she said. `` I ca n't say, and I do n't think anyone can say, whether they picked them up from the Russian people.'' <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> picked up the <PERSON> Runza </PERSON> from his mother, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> `` Sally'' <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, who learned how to bake Runzas from her mother on a farm near <LOCATION> Sutton </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Brening </PERSON>, and her brother-in-law, <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Everett </ORGANIZATION>, found themselves looking for work shortly after World War II. With an investment of about $ 500, the three opened the first <LOCATION> Runza </LOCATION> restaurant in 1950. Mrs. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brening </PERSON> still own the original Runza, but they sold the trade name rights to <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> in 1966. A subsidiary, Runza National, has franchised 42 of the restaurants, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> said. Thirty-six of the restaurants are in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Three are in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, a major stockholder in about half the restaurants, has enough franchise applications on file to expand the chain rapidly. But he said <PERSON> Runza </PERSON> <PERSON> Drive-Inns </PERSON> will only grow as quickly as qualified owners and managers are found. `` We have more than 1,400 applications, but we do n't give them serious consideration because they do n't have qualified managers to send here for training,'' he said. If a franchise application receives initial approval, the applicant or a designated store manager must come to <PERSON> Runza </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> headquarters for 50 hours of training The franchise is not awarded until the training period, which includes working in <LOCATION> Runza </LOCATION> restaurants, is successfully completed, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kathi </PERSON> <PERSON> Krause </PERSON> started working at <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>'s first <LOCATION> Runza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive-Inn </LOCATION> in 1972 at age 16 as a $ 1 per hour carhop. Today, she's a major stockholder in nine <LOCATION> Runza </LOCATION> restaurants. In states other than <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Krause </PERSON> admits, <PERSON> Runzas </PERSON> can be a hard sell. `` It's kind of been a word-of-mouth recipe that people in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> have really grown accustomed to,'' she said. `` Outside <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, we've had to work a little harder to let people know what they are.''

 As <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' pilots union fought in court to stop the transfer of the carrier's <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION>, the leader of the nation's unionized pilots said the takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> routes by a small, low-cost cargo company could lead to industrywide action. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, national chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to let tiny <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> operate <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> planes out of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> could draw `` full labor reaction.'' `` Pilots all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will see this as a threat to the professions,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> in a story published today. `` If one company could get away with this, other companies with like minds could duplicate it.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill., will hold hearings Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed provision of pilots and crews to operate 26 planes out of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, starting April 1 The pilots would receive one-third the pay now earned by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s crews, according to details made public of the contract with <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern unions see the <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> deal as both a way for the money-losing carrier to lower costs and to keep operating during a strike. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday signed an order to expedite the pilots' legal effort to stop the shuttle transfer and management's counter-effort to move the transfer He set an April 12 hearing. The order also included requirement of a 10-day notice to the pilots and court before any transfer of the shuttle, meaning the shuttle transfer could n't come before April 22. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> criticized a pilots' press release that said Eastern was `` barred from the shuttle transfer until court ruling.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has issued a misleading, preposterous release ... They are up to their old tricks,'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said the court order was a joint agreement among <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, its parent company and the pilots and that it would allow management to keep its original schedule of mid-April for making the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> shuttle a separate entity. He said the agreement mainly set up a schedule for depositions and filings in the discovery, or evidence-gathering, phase of the case. Eastern had asked the court to dismiss the pilots' challenge so it could go ahead with the shuttle transfer. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> outraged <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s labor leaders last week by announcing the profitable <LOCATION> Boston-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Washington </LOCATION> shuttle would become a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> division called Air-Shuttle. The pilots union last year filed suit seeking to block any transfer of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s assets. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> last year made <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s reservations system a separate entity and transferred or sold some aircraft, gates and routes to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- also owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and other carriers. `` Unilateral dismemberment by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> management of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> will not be tolerated,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, chairman of the Eastern pilots union. `` The shuttle is not gone, and we will fight to keep it within Eastern using every available resource. `` We're confident that Judge <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> will agree with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots that a unilateral <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION> transfer is unlawful and nothing more than a union-busting tool,'' <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> contends the sale of the shuttle service violates the federal Railway Labor Act by changing the working conditions of Eastern pilots without collective bargaining and undermining <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s collective bargaining status <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON>, representing the pilots, said he would seek <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> internal memos, and also will ask during depositions of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> officers, about plans for any more asset transfers, such as `` Latin American routes; significant transfers of aircraft to other airlines.'' `` Then we proceed to court for an injunction to prohibit the systematic dissection and dismantling of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said it would pay <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, reeling from a decade of losses, $ 125 million cash and $ 100 million more in securities for the shuttle. Eastern union officials say the shuttle has brought in more than $ 125 million cash in the last three years.

<HEAD>Mexico Sets Feb. 26 for Auction on Foreign Debt Bonds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A majority of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s creditor banks have given the government permission to go ahead with a new proposal to swap some of its enormous foreign debt for special bonds, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. At the same time, it announced that the first auction of the bonds had been tentatively set for Feb. 26, a week later than initially planned. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the exchange agent of the deal, said in a statement Thursday that the deadline was extended by a week `` in response to requests from numerous banks to prepare their bids.'' Under the program, the government plans to exchange some of the debt it owes foreign commercial bankers for new, 20-year bonds that will be issued by the government. The Mexican bonds will be backed by $ 10 billion worth of special securities to be issued early this year by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is expected to pay about $ 2 billion for the 20-year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> zero coupon bonds, which pay no interest but are issued at a sharp discount of their face value. In a statement released late Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it asked its approximately 600 creditor banks permission to offer the bonds because provisions in the loan contracts bar it from giving preferences in the repayment of the debts. It received majority approval on Feb. 5, it said. Even so, it said, `` the fact that the banks have expressed agreement so that the bonds can be issued does not imply a commitment on their part to take part in the auction.'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurria </PERSON>, the nation's chief debt negotiator, said 300 banks had given their authorization for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to go ahead with the auction. The program would apply to $ 51 billion of the country's total foreign debt of about $ 105 billion, the second highest in the developing world after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Some major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks reportedly plan to shun the auction because they are unhappy that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will continue obtaining loans at 100 percent of their value while paying back, through the bond program, its old loans at about half their value. They also are reluctant to accept losses of 50 percent or so on the loans entered into years ago. <PERSON> Gurria </PERSON>, in an interview with the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION>, shrugged off the banks' concerns. `` It does n't worry us ...,'' he said. `` The banks should make their decision and quote it. No one pressures them, nor suggests a price to them.'' `` We are not negotiating,'' he said, `` they are taking their position and they will declare it in a sealed envelope.'' When government officials open the bids, he said, `` those that please us most we take, and those that do n't, no. The auction mechanism eliminates negotiations.'' He said the government `` has no preconceived idea about prices or levels. ... We have a totally open mind because we are entering new ground. Nothing will happen if the offers in the auction are not accepted.'' Government officials have said previously that if they do n't consider the bids good enough, they may well not accept any Under the program, banks would exchange their old debt for the new bonds, letting <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> recover 52 cents or so for each dollar in the secondary market. That means that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> could retire part of its debt for half its face value. By reducing its debt, the government will also cut the amount of interest it pays each year on the loans. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was scheduled to pay an estimated $ 8 billion to $ 9 billion in interest charges in 1987.

 A federal judge has turned down <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s request to dismiss <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s challenge of a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> anti-takeover law, while the federal government has indicated it might intervene in the case. In another development Thursday, Toronto-based Campeau disclosed more financing details for a proposed $ 5.4 billion merger with Cincinnati-based Federated. The merger was offered as an alternative to its outstanding $ 4.2 billion hostile tender offer. `` We believe that the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> board can not, consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities to stockholders, continue to refuse to meet with us,'' <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> said in a letter to Federated Chairman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldfede </PERSON>. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> had no comment on <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s renewed offer, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sluzewski </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> submitted a brief Thursday supporting <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s right to challenge the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> statute. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also indicated it might express an opinion on the merits of the suit itself. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Sand in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had asked the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> for comment on <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s motion to dismiss <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s suit. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, which is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, contended <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> had no standing to make the constitutional challenge because it did not have assured financing for its hostile takeover bid. But the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> indicated `` the substantial efforts and expenditures'' undertaken by a party making a tender offer satisfied the requirement that a party have a `` personal stake'' in an issue in order to have standing to sue. The brief also stated <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> could suffer `` substantial injury'' if forced to wait for assurance of financing before pressing its lawsuit, and such assurance would do little or nothing to clarify the constitutional issues in the case. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> challeged the takeover law as an unconstitutional interference with interstate commerce and an infringement on federal regulatory authority. The law is regarded as significant because of the thousands of major companies that have incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has a $ 2.03 billion hostile offer outstanding for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also has challenged the law. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Summergrad </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> assistant general counsel, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the agency's staff also was considering a similar `` friend of the court'' brief addressing the actual issues raised by the suit. He said a decision on whether to file such a brief should be made in the next two weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> also has filed suit to challenge <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s `` poison pill'' takeover defense, but that issue was not addressed by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> brief issued Thursday. Federated shares jumped $ 2.37 -LCB- to $ 59.87 -LCB- a share Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> further disclosed that it had financing commitments for $ 200 million of a planned $ 500 million bank loan being arranged by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paribas </ORGANIZATION> and a commitment for a $ 100 million short-term `` bridge'' loan from <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. First <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> also indicated it was highly confident it could raise up to $ 1 billion in subordinated debt to finance the merger <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said in his letter to <PERSON> Goldfeder </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has committed $ 500 million to the deal and `` has advised us that it is highly confident that commitments can be obtained for the balance of the required financing.'' <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday disclosed it had agreements for $ 660 million in financing for its $ 5.4 billion offer. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> has said it would discuss that offer, which was applicable only in a definitive merger agreement, if <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> showed it had enough financing to complete the buyout. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> shopping center developer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBartolo </PERSON>, who helped finance <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 3.4 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, agreed to lend $ 400 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it will press its billion-dollar buyout bid for <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> despite a unanimous rejection of the offer by the <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop board of directors. `` Our offer is still outstanding,'' <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> said Thursday following the rejection of the offer. `` Our offer is to the 90 percent of the shareholders who are not on the board.'' In rejecting the offer, the <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop board said the $ 1.03 billion buyout, a bid of $ 37 a share, was inadequate and not in the best interests of the company or its stockholders. Among the board's considerations was information that <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> has yet to secure commitments to provide financing for its offer, <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Shop </PERSON> said in a statement. Stop & amp; Shop also said it was exploring alternatives to the unsolicited offer, including a possible sale of the firm. A company statement said <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop had received `` indications of interest from third parties for a transaction with the company.'' But <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> was prepared to compete for Stop & amp; Shop. `` If there is a higher bona fide alternative to our offer, we intend to bid against it,'' <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Stop & amp; Shop said its other alternatives included exploring a leveraged buyout, recapitalization or other restructuring. In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to purchase a company and then pay off the debt with the company's cash flow or the sale of its assets. Stop & amp; Shop, which operates 141 supermarkets and 171 <ORGANIZATION> Bradlees </ORGANIZATION> department stores around the country, has said publicly it prefers to remain independent. The statement referred to <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>'s history of making millions of dollars in profits through failed takeover bids. Many analysts doubt that <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> is sincere in wanting to acquire and operate a retail company. <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> denied his company had made its offer solely to profit from its Stop & amp; Shop holdings. The <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> has acquired 738,220 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop, 2.7 percent of the outstanding shares. <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> had begun the process under which it could call a special meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop shareholders for the purpose of replacing the company's board with directors more sympathetic to the offer. <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop stock fell 50 cents Thursday to $ 36.87 -LCB- a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. Announcemennt of the rejection came after the close of trading. <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> and his father <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, the chairman of <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>, had offered $ 31 a share for the retailer, and earlier this week raised the bid to $ 37. In <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, officials at Local 919 of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday they have retained a team of lawyers, investment bankers and other advisers to explore the workers' options in the face of the <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> bid. The union also requested a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop directors. `` We are exploring all and every appropriate alternative to protect the interests and jobs of the employees we represent,'' said local president <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON>. Among the options being considered are seeking a `` white knight,'' a suitor sympathetic to the employees' interests, and an employee stock ownership plan in a possible leveraged buyout, <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> local, which represents 10,000 <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop workers, is leading the effort on behalf of other locals. <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop has a total of 35,000 workers.

<TEXT>
 A Franco-Belgian deal to keep a restructured <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> in Belgian hands fell through Friday and revitalized a bid by Italian investor <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> to take effective control of the nation's biggest holding company. Belgian industrialist <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> failed to get the necessary backing from a group of mostly Belgian shareholders to approve a deal with the French holding <ORGANIZATION> Cie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> to take control of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> said in a statement `` he considered his mandate as spokesman for the group as over.'' He added he would not take new initiatives in the fight for control of the company that has a stake in a third of the Belgian economy. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> is trying to get effective control of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> and use it as a platform for a pan-European financial holding company. The Italian investor claims to be the largest single shareholder and can control, through allies, 38 percent of stock in the company. He has a public offer for 15 percent more. The 166-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> has interests in about 1,400 companies world-wide with assets totaling nearly $ 3 billion. The group of mostly Belgian investors formed around <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> said it had 28 percent of stocks in the company while <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> claimed 15 percent. But together with various small allies <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> said the bloc would have been assured of absolute majority at shareholders meetings. The accord was also favored by the current management of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, which has come under sharp attack by <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>. Even before Friday's rejection of the <LOCATION> Leysen-Suez </LOCATION> deal, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> had offered to cooperate with Belgian shareholders in restructuring <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, with a Belgian as chief officer and himself running the day-to-day management. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> did not extend the offer for cooperation to <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> however. A shareholder can block management decisions when he has 25 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> stock. Friday's developments followed a week of frantic negotiations between the three interested parties and threatened to defeat <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>'s bid to take control of the company. <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> meanwhile said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> it would continue to negotiate with Belgian shareholders despite <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON>'s withdrawal. <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement the group `` is continuing discussions with all the Belgian shareholders that have expressed their desire to build a balanced partnership with us.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has fought off cosmetic giant <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> repeatedly, is now being chased by a group led by <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> RB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> has accumulated 6.76 million <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shares, or about 5.8 percent of the company's roughly 115.9 million shares outstanding, the group disclosed Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>, a partnership that was instrumental in the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, indicated it would like to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> general partner. Failing that, <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> may meet with potential buyers of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock in an attempt to seek representation for the upcoming board of directors annual meeting in April. `` We do n't want to break up <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said. `` The smartest thing would be to see the company purchased by another entity.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mockler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said in a prepared statement, `` RB Partners appears to be trying to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> directors into putting the company up for sale and to stir up renewed speculation in <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock.'' `` The directors have consistently stated the view that <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> has a bright future as an independent company,'' the statement said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> group said it acquired the shares because it believed they were undervalued. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> also indicated it would attempt to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> management to determine the steps the company would take to boost its stock price. But according to the <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> release, the company was satisfied that a recent restructuring was sufficiently boosting shareholder values and it would not be pressured into giving up its independence. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Shore </PERSON> said if <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> pursued a proxy fight against <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> management, it might find support in the many institutions that hold company stock. Thursday's disclosure came after several days of renewed takeover speculation surrounding <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> that sent the consumer products company's stock shooting higher. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 3.62 -LCB- to $ 41 a share in active <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Thursday. The group stated it might meet with potential acquirers to determine their interest in buying <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, and to compare the price they might offer against the benefits of a management plan. Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> long has been the object of takeover speculation. Over the past two years the company has spurned several takeover offers from <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the latest a $ 5.41 billion proposal. The companies signed a standstill agreement in November 1986, after <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> acquired a 14 percent take in <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> and made its initial unsuccessful offer for a $ 4.12 billion buyout. The pact prohibits <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> from launching a tender offer without the consent of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors _ which adamantly has opposed takeover overtures. After rebuffing <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> undertook a restructuring that included layoffs of about 2,400 workers and the sale of a number of its smaller businesses. Last November, the company announced a reorganization that split it into two main units, one for its North American and European razor, razor blade, personal products and stationary products businesses and the other for international and diversified units. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s moves indicated it believed <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> was worth more than the stock market had valued it, and the group might realize a bigger profit from the proceeds of a buyout, breakup or other restructuring than it would from a long-term rise in the company's stock price <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Gollust </PERSON>, a general partner in the group, declined to identify the parties deemed potential buyers for <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, although rumored acquirers in the past have included the British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION>, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company.

 Now that Wall Street has been in a bear market for nearly six months, some venturesome investors are searching out `` cheap'' stocks to buy. Of course, just about all the merchandise a stockbroker has to offer has been marked down significantly since last summer. But some stocks may, upon appraisal, look cheaper than others. How to identify them? One handy way is to plug several statistical measures into a computer program and instruct the machine to search the market for stocks that meet those criteria. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, analysts at the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> who are well known on Wall Street for screens of this type, have just completed one. They found `` deep discount stocks'' predominating in electric utilities, banking, insurance, savings and loans, and some household-name blue chips as well. `` No investment decision is warranted on the basis of these figures alone,'' they caution. If a stock is out of favor, there are likely to be excellent reasons why. `` The data should be used as a starting point in a quest for unusually attractive values,'' <PERSON> Weinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> say. The analysts set three standards for a stock to qualify as deeply discounted: _ Its price-earnings ratio had to be at least one-third below the average for the market as a whole, as measured by <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials; _ It must carry a dividend yield at least one-third more than the S & amp; P 400; _ The ratio of its stock price to book value, or theoretical worth if the company were to be liquidated, had to be at least one-third below the aggregate ratio for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 400. The two biggest names that showed up on <PERSON> Weinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>'s screen were <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> _ prime examples of `` companies that clearly would be affected by any slowdown in consumer spending,'' the analysts noted Also conspicuous by its presence is <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting the depressed state of the securities industry. Numerous banking concerns also made the least-loved list, thanks -LRB- if that is the right word -RRB- to worries about loans in Third World countries and in real estate and energy deals that investors are worried about. Representatives from the insurance industry include such prominent participants as <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cigna </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION>. From the savings and loan group: <ORGANIZATION> H.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahmanson </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Calfed </ORGANIZATION> and Great Western Financial. And then there are no less than 57 utilities, from <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Pacificorp </ORGANIZATION>. This is, <PERSON> Weinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> say, `` an industry undergoing significant change. Perhaps the most important change is that capital requirements -LRB- e.g., for new plants and other facilities -RRB- are tending to flatten or decline. `` As a result, some utilities are becoming net cash generators rather than the insatiable consumers of capital they were in the 1970s. `` It is estimated that the industry in aggregate will be able to cover its capital requirements entirely from internal cash generation by 1989. This development has favorable implications for the industry's investment status. `` Improving debt-to-equity ratios could provide the basis for an upward valuation of the group, enabling utility companies to pay out a larger proportion of reported earnings in dividends. `` The group may command considerably greater investment interest as a result of the recent market decline and greater concern about prospects for continued economic growth.''

 The dollar surged in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today on news of a sharp improvement in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade performance in December. Gold bullion prices also advanced.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit narrowed to $ 12.2 billion in December, the smallest gap since January, as exports hit a record, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today. For the year, the trade deficit widened to $ 171.2 billion, the largest ever. But financial markets were expected to pay more attention to the December numbers, which came two months after the Oct. 19 stock market crash. December's merchandise trade deficit of $ 12.2 billion was an improvement from the $ 13.2 billion gap posted in November. December's deficit, the smallest since January's $ 11.9 billion shortfall, was paced by a record $ 24.8 billion in exports, a 4.2 percent improvement over November. November's gain had also resulted from surging exports. Imports, meanwhile, were at $ 37 billion in December, the same level as in the previous month. Still, for the year, the differnce between what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imported and what it exported soared 9.6 percent from the previous record deficit of $ 156.2 billion in 1986. For all of 1987, imports totaled $ 424.1 billion and exports totaled $ 252.9 billion _ up from imports of $ 383 billion and exports of $ 226.8 billion in 1986. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was quick to hail the new numbers. Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the drop in the deficit `` is good news, particularly since this is the second straight monthly decline. ... We hope this is a sign that there are better days ahead on the trade front.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, economist for <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> bond brokerage, said the trade figures demonstrate `` we are in the middle of a major change in course'' on the balance-of-trade. `` But it's a big ship. And you do n't turn it on a dime. But at least we know we're headed home,'' <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON> said. Exports have been climbing in recent months under pressure from a weaker dollar _ which makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more competitive abroad while driving up the price of imports. Government and private economists have suggested that an export boom could be the major factor in finally bringing down the trade deficit, which has been increasing steadily since the late 1970s. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continued to run its largest deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ $ 59.8 billion in 1987, up from $ 58.6 billion in 1986. The deficit with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, however, narrowed to $ 30.2 billion from $ 32.7 billion. The deficit with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> increased to $ 19.0 billion from $ 15.7 billion. And with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, it was down to $ 11.7 billion from $ 13.2 billion. The deficit with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1987 was $ 9.9 billion, up from $ 7.1 billion in 1986. With <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, it was up to $ 6.5 billion from $ 6.4 billion. And with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade shortfall rose to $ 5.9 billion from $ 5.2 billion in 1986. For December alone, the trade defcit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was $ 4.8 billion, about the same as November; with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, $ 2.7 billion, up from $ 2.4 billion; with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, $ 632.8 million, down from $ 1.3 billion; with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, $ 1.1 billion, down from $ 1.2 billion; with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, $ 762.8 million, up from $ 760.2 million. Imports for all of 1987 were up 10.7 percent while exports rose 11.5 percent. That compares to an 8.7 percent rise in imports in 1986 and only a 3.7 percent rise in exports. For the full year, imports of manufactured goods rose to $ 325.2 billion, from $ 293.8 billion. Oil imports surged to $ 44.8 billion from $ 37.6 billion. Meanwhile, exports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufactured goods were up to $ 171.5 billion, from $ 148.7 billion in 1986. In agricultural goods, one of the few categories where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintained a trade surplus, exports were up to $ 28.6 billion from $ 26.1 billion in 1987. New car imports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were $ 2.0 billion in December, the same level as in November. For the year, car imports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> totaled $ 22.2 billion, up slightly from $ 22.0 billion in 1986. New auto imports from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> were $ 1.0 billion in December, down from $ 1.2 billion in November _ and $ 10.2 billion for the year, down from $ 11.8 billion in 1986. From other countries, auto imports were $ 1.6 billion, up from $ 1.5 billion in November _ and $ 16.8 billion for all of 1987, up from $ 12.7 billion. The monthly trade figures _ which governmment analysts caution can be misleading because they are not adjusted for either seasonal factors or inflation _ have become one of the most closely watched set of government statistics by financial markets. In fact, the task force appointed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to study the market collapse identified a weaker-than-expected trade report released in early October as one factor triggering the 508-point stock price plunge. A weaker dollar can help ease the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit by making imports more expensive and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more competitive abroad. But reports of a smaller trade deficit tend to raise the value of the dollar _ which in turn can cause the deficit to widen. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in past months has joined with its major economic allies in seeking a stable dollar against other key currencies. Too rapid a fall in the value of the dollar can produce inflation. The dollar has fallen 50 percent since mid-1985 against the Japanese yen and key <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies.

 Wholesale prices rose a brisk 0.4 percent in January as higher food costs more than offset declines in energy prices, the government said today. The rise in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index negated a 0.4 percent decline in December and was the steepest monthly increase since an identical 0.4 percent jump in September. January's rise, if it persisted for 12 months, would amount to an annual inflation rate of 4.6 percent, compared with the 2.2 percent increase for all of 1987. Economists, however, still expect that wholesale prices will moderate through the balance of 1988. Food prices increased 1.7 percent in January, rebounding from a 1.4 percent decline in December. Analysts said an insect infestation in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> pushed up vegetable prices, while cold weather influenced a rise in chicken and pork prices. The increase included a 16.2 percent surge vegetable prices. Lettuce shot up 51.6 percent in Janaury. That comes atop a 10.5 percent increase in December and a 95.4 percent jump in November. Celery rocketed 44.1 percent and onions 32.5 percent. Prices for pork were up 13.2 percent; egg costs jumped 12.5 percent; chicken prices went up 5.6 percent. Costs also rose for rice, macaroni products and fish. Declines were posted for turkeys, off 12.4 percent, and fresh fruits, down 3.0 percent. Natural gas prices edged up 0.8 percent after a 3.0 percent increase in December. But steep declines were recorded for other forms of energy, which overall fell 4.5 percent, compared with a decline of 1.6 percent a month earlier. Gasoline prices fell 8.4 percent after dropping 4.2 percent in December. Home heating oil costs dropped 6.2 percent, compared with a 5.2 percent fall a month before. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON>, who runs his own inflation surveys as director of economic forecasting at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said falling energy prices reflect `` a little bit of a glut'' on the oil market. The industry, historically, takes a long time to adjust its production to price changes and there is still some overproduction stemming from oil price increases in the early 1980s, he said. Minus the usually volatile food and energy categories, the index for all other finished goods rose a brisk 0.5 percent, compared with a 0.2 percent increase in December. <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> said this figure was pushed higher by publishers of newspapers and magazines and producers of items sold through catalogs, who tend to raise their prices once at the beginning of each year. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> gave these other specifics on January wholesale price activity: _ New automobile prices were up 0.2 percent, following a 1.9 percent drop in December _ Alcoholic beverage costs were up 0.1 percent after a 0.3 percent increase a month earlier _ Household appliance prices were down 0.2 percent, compared with an 0.2 percent increase in December _ Home electronic equipment costs fell 0.2 percent after dropping 0.5 percent earlier Gains were also posted for adults' and children's clothing and shoes. The figures are adjusted to remove predictable seasonal price fluctuations. The wholesale price calculation excludes services and imports, areas of the economy where price increases have been more rapid in part because of the falling dollar, which makes foreign products more expensive. The Consumer Price Index, which tracks prices at the retail level and includes services and imports, is due out Feb. 26 for January. Inflation at the consumer level was 4.4 percent in 1987. The January increase left the overall Producer Price Index, which is not seasonally adjusted, at 106.2 percent of its 1982 base-period average. That means that a selection of goods costing $ 10 in 1982 cost $ 10.62 last month, up from $ 10.57 in December and $ 10.40 in January 1987. The government used the 1982 base for the first time in the January report. It had used a 1967 base since 1971. A selection of goods that cost $ 10 in 1967, cost $ 29.80 last month, up from $ 29.68 in December and $ 29.18 in January 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, with the January report, also revised its seasonal adjustments for the past five years, changing previously reported percent changes in many categories. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, president of his own economic consulting firm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said a modest rebound in wholesale inflation may spook the bond market and send long-term interest rates up. But <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a Philadelphia-area forecasting service, said the markets will be looking more closely at December trade deficit figures, also released this morning. `` Generally speaking, inflation is still pretty mild,'' <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> predicts moderate wholesale inflation of 2.6 percent for 1988 and a more robust 3.9 percent in 1989. `` The major thrust of the -LRB- 1988 -RRB- increase is ... higher farm prices, especially for the grains, and a slight increase in -LRB- energy -RRB- prices,'' he said. `` ... Our current estimates suggest that reacceleration of significant inflationary pressures may develop in 1989 as oil prices rise.''

Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An agreement has been reached between union construction crews and <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, ending a four-month labor dispute at the <LOCATION> Whiting </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, refinery. A union official said Thursday the Chicago-based oil company had agreed to use only union contractors. In return, the unions agreed to call off picketing and a campaign calling for a union consumer boycott of <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>'s gas stations. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the Chicago-based oil company agreed to use only union contractors for any refinery construction work in the future. The dispute began in October, when <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> hired non-union contractors for $ 10 million worth of construction and renovation work at the 99-year-old refinery. The work was completed recently despite the presence of union picket lines. More than 55 people were arrested and several were injured during the first days of the picketing, which drew as many as 1,000 union members. In a move to put economic pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>, the unions withdrew at least $ 100 million in funds from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> banks that had <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> executives on their boards of directors. <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON> said redepositing of that money was not part of the settlement worked out with the company. Resolution of the dispute came several days after members of the Oil, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> endorsed a two-year contract covering the Whiting refinery and other <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> installations around the country. `` All parties are gratified with the settlement and are looking forward to a resumption of work,'' <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Thursday.

Prices Jump</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 10 grafs to UPDATE with December figure on

<TEXT>
 The nation's deficit in foreign trade stood at a lower-than-expected $ 12.2 billion in December, while business inventories jumped, the government said today. It also said wholesale prices rose a brisk 0.4 percent in January. The trade figure was the lowest in 11 months, reflecting a surge in exports, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said. For the year, the trade deficit widened to a record $ 171.2 billion, the largest ever. But financial markets were expected to pay more attention to the December numbers, which came two months after the Oct. 19 stock market crash. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said higher food costs more than offset declines in energy prices last month, easily wiping out a 0.4 percent decline in December's Producer Price Index. It was the steepest monthly increase since an identical 0.4 percent jump in September, and would amount to an annual inflation rate of 4.6 percent _ if it persisted all year. The annual rate of increase for all of 1987 was 2.2 percent. Analysts still expect that wholesale prices will moderate through the balance of 1988, however. In another report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said business inventories shot up 0.8 percent in December, the third consecutive large monthly advance. The December increase pushed unsold stockpiles on shelves and backlots up by $ 5.45 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 701.87 billion. The increase followed even larger gains of 0.9 percent in November and 1.1 percent in October. While the economy, as measured by the gross national product, expanded at a brisk 4.2 percent annual rate in the final three months of the year, nearly three-fourths of that growth came from an unusually large buildup in inventories which was occurring at the same time that consumer spending was falling. Because of this combination, many analysts believe growth in the first three months of 1988 will be extremely sluggish, with some analysts even forecasting one quarter of negative GNP growth. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said retail sales activity posted its third monthly increase in January, as a rebound in auto sales boosted the key economic sector. Some economists said January's 0.5 percent rise in retail sales reflected a continued recovery in consumer confidence that was jarred during the October stock market crash. In addition to the January rise, the government revised upward the sales gains reported for the two previous months. Sales were up a strong 1.2 percent in December and 0.3 percent in November, compared with previous estimates of 0.7 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively. Because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity, analysts have been watching it closely for signs of a slowdown in the wake of the crash. But although January's gains were supported by a 1.6 percent rise in auto sales, some analysts said the figures were strong enough to indicate consumers were not dragging the economy into a recession. Sales had declined by a sharp 0.9 percent in October and 1.7 percent in September. Retail establishments sold $ 128.1 billion worth of goods in January, up $ 600 million from December, the government said. It was the highest monthly total since August, when sales hit $ 128.9 billion. A separate government report indicated severely cold weather boosted Americans' home heating bills by nearly a half-billion dollars in January. The survey by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> indicated home heating cost Americans $ 9.98 billion in January, $ 470 million more than if weather for the month had been average. That means the typical home owner or renter spent $ 138.80 on oil, gas or electricity to keep warm last month, $ 6.54 more than the bill would have been in a normal January. Costs vary considerably across the country, but bills were above normal in every area except the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, according to the monthly report. In other economic news on Thursday, a selective midwinter review of the farm labor situation by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> showed there were about 11 percent more hired workers on the job than a year ago. A quarterly report showed about 340,000 workers hired by farmers were on the job during a survey in the week Jan. 10-16, compared with 307,000 a year earlier.

 Leaders of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> looked for a way out of the trading bloc's financial crisis during an emergency summit today The two-day summit, which began Thursday, stalled for several hours through the morning as West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, the summmit chairman, met separately with several leaders. The meeting resumed midafternoon. The summit adjourned within minutes of the morning opening after <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> threw out proposals for relatively stringent curbs on the trade bloc's runaway farm spending after seeing detailed costings drawn up overnight by officials. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, seeking less painful measures for its farmers as the spring presidential election looms, declared it could yield no more, while <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and Dutch Premier <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> held out for austerity. Through most of the morning, the leaders sat around in groups with their foreign ministers in the main conference room at the EEC headquarters chatting informally. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, striving to head off a third successive <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> summit failure in eight months, met separately with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>. `` On the steep and difficult climb toward the summit there is a dense fog and some people have lost their way,'' West German government spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> told reporters. He said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> wanted `` a success, but not a success at any price.'' Earlier, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> agriculture minister <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON>, said in a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> radio interview that `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has no more to give on the agriculture issue.'' `` When you reach a certain moment, you have to know how to say no,'' said <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON>. Dutch spokesman <PERSON> Nic-Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonker </PERSON> told reporters, `` It is wrong to assume that the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> will give in.'' In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, angry farmers today plowed furrows in the Champ de Mars, a park near the Eiffel Tower, to protest some <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> members' proposals for cuts in farm spending About 50 people participated in the demonstration. They dug several furrows, then left peacefully when police arrived shortly after noon. European leaders argued late into the night Thursday in an effort to reach agreement on a number of issues. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> urged them to forget their national interests, saying, `` National go-it-alone policies are doomed to fail now.'' The Common Market members are grappling with these interrelated issues: _ Curbing agriculture spending that totaled $ 33.8 billion last year, or two-thirds of the total <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> budget _ Raising funds for regional development in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s poorest areas of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> _ Devising a new <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> funding formula based on the relative wealth of each member state, which now contribute 1.4 percent of their sales taxes Two previous summits failed to produce agreement on any of these issues. Lacking a 1988 budget, the Community is now operating at last year's funding levels. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> want the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s farm spending to be raised by $ 625,000 in 1988. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, both with politically powerful farming lobbies, have sought an increase of $ 3.1 billion. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> also wants production of cereals, a commodity already in gross oversupply, to be held at 160 million tons annually, as opposed to 155 million tons as demanded by the Dutch and the British. `` If we accede to the French, we face severe trade problems -LRB- with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other producers -RRB-. It is not a budgetary issue,'' Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> told reporters after the summit's first day. But <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> joined the rich northern countries to defeat proposals for nearly doubling the $ 8.8 billion allowance for regional development. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other northern nations seek an increase of just 50 percent.

 Stock prices rose today in what analysts described as a muted response to news of a smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 15.91 to 1,977.45 by noontime on Wall Street.

Before the market opened the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $ 12.20 billion in December from $ 13.22 billion the month before. The figure came in at the low end of analysts' estimates, and lent support to the growing belief that the international trade situation was improving.

 <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest bank Friday announced it entered a `` banking alliance'' with one of the biggest Dutch banks to form a major European financial group. The <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Belgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A </ORGANIZATION> will try to set up `` an integrated multinational banking group within three years,'' said <PERSON> Generale </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Banque </PERSON>'s chairman, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villegas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercamp </PERSON>. Officials said the two banks launched the venture by acquiring partial ownership of each other and by putting funds into a joint holding company, <ORGANIZATION> TUBA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BV </ORGANIZATION>. Each of the two partners has a 50 percent capital stake in <ORGANIZATION> TUBA </ORGANIZATION>, which will be managed on a joint basis. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villegas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercamp </PERSON> denied that the agreement had been made with <PERSON> Amro </PERSON> to head off a possible bid by Italian investor <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, who is trying to take effective control of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s biggest holding company. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> has a 13.4 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villegas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercamp </PERSON> acknowledged, however, that the battle for control of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> gave rise to the feeling that the bank's clients' trust and confidence may have been shaken. He said <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, which has three seats on the bank's board, had given general approval for the project _ but when it came to a vote, the three representatives had abstained `` for personal reasons. He did not elaborate. Deposits of Generale de Banque amounted to $ 52.047 billion while <ORGANIZATION> Amro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s deposits $ 58.343 billion, based on 1986 statistics. The Generale de Banque chairman said the two banks were forming the alliance to prepare `` for the intense competition which must be faced,'' after 1992. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> has targeted that year for a complete end to barriers in the exchange of goods, capital and trade among the 12 member nations.

 Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks are n't expected to participate in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s innovative debt-reduction plan, an American banker said Friday. A senior official at <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, however, said his bank will tender some of its loans. The bankers made their comments at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> conference on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> organized by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Under the program, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government plans to exchange some of the debt it owes foreign commercial banks for new, 20-year bonds that will be issued by the government and backed by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds. Mexican officials have indicated they expect to retire $ 20 billion of debt through the $ 10 billion bond issue. The country has $ 105.6 billion in total outstanding debt. In a statement released late Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it asked its approximately 600 creditor banks permission to offer the bonds and that it received majority approval on Feb. 5. But <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marin </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, told the conference, `` I do not believe any major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks will tender'' their loans under the Mexican plan. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks have provisions equal to about 25 percent of their Third World loan exposure and this wo n't cover the 50 percent discount at which <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> expects the banks to swap their loans, <PERSON> Marin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marin </PERSON> indicated that the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> plan to swap loans for new bonds is designed for smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regional banks that wish to dump their Mexican exposure. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutolf </PERSON>, general manager at <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said his bank will submit a bid, and called the plan a `` step in the right direction.'' <PERSON> Lutolf </PERSON> would n't say at what discount his bank would tender its loans but indicated it would be above 50 percent of face value. `` Fifty percent wo n't fly,'' he said. An official at <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Basel </LOCATION>, who refused to be identified, said the bank plans to tender about one-third of its Mexican loans but would n't say how large its exposure is. The official said <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> banks must have provisions equal to at least 35 percent of their Third World exposure and that his bank is comfortably above that level. Auction of the bonds had been tentatively set for Feb. 26, a week later than initially planned.

<HEAD>Canada's December Trade Surplus Shrinks To 208 Million Canadian
Dollars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade surplus shrank to 208 million Canadian dollars in December, or about $ 164 million, the lowest monthly surplus since September 1981, <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The December surplus, down from a revised 402 million Canadian dollars in November, left the full year's surplus at the lowest level in seven years. The 1987 surplus totaled 10.3 billion Canadian dollars, or about $ 8.1 billion, down marginally from 10.4 billion Canadian dollars in 1986, the agency said. The surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s most important trading partner, declined to 17 billion Canadian dollars from 18.4 billion Canadian dollars in 1986. Those numbers are reconciled with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovacs </PERSON>, senior economist at the Burns Fry investment house in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, said he had expected 1987 would have ended with a much stronger trade surplus _ the result of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> exporting more goods than it imported. `` We clearly had a deteriorating trend at the end of the year, which is disturbing,'' said <PERSON> Kovacs </PERSON>. Exports grew by 4.1 per cent in 1987 from the previous year, rising to 125.8 billion Canadian dollars largely on strong foreign sales of forest products. However, imports increased at the slightly quicker pace of 4.7 per cent during the year to reach 115.4 billion Canadian dollars by year end. Meanwhile, the trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the No. 2 trading partner, fell to 691 million Canadian dollars from more than 1.6 billion Canadian dollars the year before. <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> said the rise in exports was mainly the result of an increase of 3.2 billion Canadian dollars in forest-product sales that came despite export taxes <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was forced to impose on softwood lumber because of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> action. However, foreign sales of automotive products from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> fell by 2.2 billion Canadian dollars to 32 billion Canadian dollars. Merchandise trade is only about half of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s total trade picture, with the rest coming in service sectors such as tourism, shipping and consulting.

 Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> asked <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s attorney general today to prepare a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> because of its plans to close its automaking plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, but left open the possibility of a settlement <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said it was possible an agreement could be reached with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> before the issue actually goes to court. Asked about the odds of the matter actually ending up in court, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> replied, `` I do n't want to engage in a percentage'' at this time. The governor stressed that, in such matters, it is always desirable to negotiate before going to court. `` That would certainly spare the trauma. It would be better off for both parties to settle'' without going to court, he said. `` The attorney general has advised me ... that we do have a good and winnable case,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who was joined at a news conference by Attorney General <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanaway </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said it could be some time before the suit is filed over <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to lay off 5,500 workers in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>. He said he talked Tuesday with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> and would meet later with other <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> officials. He declined to say where or when the meeting would occur. `` The lawsuit is a type of thing that can be won in several ways,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. The governor said he has asked <PERSON> Hanaway </PERSON> to check with local government officials in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> and with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union Local 72 at the Chrysler plant there to see if they want to join in the lawsuit. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> repeated his contention that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to abandon automaking in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> was political and not economic. He said Omni-Horizon cars were being produced at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> efficiently and were of the highest quality. `` There is no reason,'' he said, `` for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> not to live up'' to what the state contends was an agreement by the automaker to produce the cars at the plant for five years. `` All of us at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> are very sorry that the plant had to be closed. We also feel very deeply for the pain and suffering'' of the workers and community, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s announcement `` I guess you could say <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> was overly optimistic'' when it told workers and government officials in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> that it believed it could build the Omni-Horizon small car at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> for up to five years, <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> said. `` But we never lied to anyone and we believe there are no grounds for a lawsuit claiming we did lie,'' he said. <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will repay the city and county of <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> more than $ 1 million the governments spent on improvements for the plant. `` My position is the retention of 5,500 jobs for five years,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` Those jobs do n't necessarily have to be automobile jobs. They could be other manufacturing jobs.'' <PERSON> Hanaway </PERSON> said it had not been decided precisely what <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> would seek in the suit, but he said the state probably would ask the court for an injunction to delay the layoffs. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, asked if defense contracts for the plant might be something the state would go after, replied: `` I think that is a possibility.'' In fiscal year 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and three subsidiaries _ <ORGANIZATION> Electrospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gulfstream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ were awarded 375 <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracts worth more than $ 268 million. In the first two months of fiscal 1988, the contractors won $ 11 million in contracts.

 Stock prices rose only moderately on Friday despite news of an improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 4.2 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,734.0 at the close. Volume was a low 323.4 million shares, down from 352.7 million shares a day earlier. The market was calm for most of the morning session as investors awaited the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade data. But it responded only moderately to the better-than-expected report. The 100-stock index rose briefly to its session peak of 5.1 points higher after the figures were released. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $ 12.2 billion in December from a November deficit of $ 13.22 billion. Analysts were bemused by the lack of response to the trade report. `` It was a day with nothing but good news for equities, but the market did n't do anything,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` The market's mood seems to be to look for bad news all the time,'' he said. <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON> attributed the modest response to continued lack of institutional buying of British shares.

<HEAD>Dollar Jumps on Trade Report, Gold Also Higher</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The dollar jumped higher against most major foreign currencies in moderate European trading Friday, following news that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit shrank to $ 12.2 billion in December from $ 13.2 billion the previous month. Gold prices also moved up. The dollar surged quickly after the trade figures were reported, but profit-taking pushed it back somewhat. The dollar finished with a gain of almost two cents against the British pound and more than two pfennigs against the West German mark. It also gained more than two yen against the Japanese yen, but that increase was spread over two days because Thursday was a national holiday in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` It was a good -LRB- trade -RRB- number,'' said one <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer, `` but overall it's still too early to say the dollar has turned a corner.'' Dealers were heartened by the news that exports rose 4.2 percent to a record $ 24.8 billion, while imports were unchanged at $ 37 billion. The report also showed the deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> narrowed to $ 4.79 billion from $ 4.85 billion. However, dealers said they are reserving judgment on the dollar's upside potential until Monday, when Japanese trade data for January will be released. A significant reduction in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would support the dollar's bullish undertone, dealers said. The dollar rose above 130 Japanese yen for the first time since mid-December, trading at 131.15 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, up from 129.95 earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, and up from 129.03 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.7123 West German marks, up from 1.6885; 1.4065 Swiss francs, up from 1.3870; 5.7865 French francs, up from 5.7135; 1.9225 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8961; 1,260.75 Italian lire, up from 1,246.65; and 1.2624 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2663. The British pound fell to $ 1.7401 from $ 1.7595 late Thursday. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 443 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 441.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was higher, closing at a bid $ 443.50 compared with $ 441 late Thursday. Earlier, the metal closed in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> at a bid of $ 443.69, down from $ 443.93. Silver bullion prices rose on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.34 a troy ounce, compared with $ 6.31 late Thursday.

<DATELINE>HAWTHORNE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Toymaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday posted losses of $ 100.7 million for the fourth quarter and $ 113.2 million for the year, with virtually all the red ink accounted for by restructuring costs. The maker of Barbie dolls, Hot Wheels and other toys also disclosed it has trimmed its headquarters staff by 22 percent over the last year, to 1,720 workers from 2,200. <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION>'s troubles reflect a malaise in the toy industry that persisted through much of last year. The company's $ 100.7 million deficit for the three months ended Dec. 26 compared with a loss of $ 26.9 million the previous year. Revenue was off by 14 percent to $ 233.8 million from $ 271.9 million. The most recent period included $ 61.8 million in restructuring expenses and debt restructuring costs. For the full year, the company's deficit of $ 113.2 million, compared to a loss of $ 8.3 million in 1986, came on a 3.7 percent decline in revenue to $ 1.02 billion from $ 1.06 billion. The 1987 results included $ 96 million in restructuring expenses. Last month, in the wake of a bitter strike at its production facility in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION> announced it would close that plant and pull out of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION>, which does all of its manufacturing overseas, shifted the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> work to elsewhere in the Orient. That action was not a factor in the company's restructuring, which dealt only with changes at the company's headquarters.

 Soybean futures prices leaped higher Friday in the last hour of trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>.

 It's the ultimate Valentine's Day challenge for lingerie retailers: Can you top this bottom? From rhinestone-studded undies to briefs fitted with music boxes to a club that delivers perfumed, gift-wrapped panties, the lingerie industry is shedding its cotton-drawer image and exploiting the holiday of the heart. Some insiders say that for this special sub-category of women's clothing retailers, <ORGANIZATION> Valentine </ORGANIZATION>'s Day is second only to Christmas when it comes to racking up holiday sales Their most compelling sales pitch is that no matter how scanty, lingerie lasts longer than roses and is n't fattening like chocolates. <PERSON> Lila </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> thinks her Panty-of-the-Month Club covers the territory when it comes to imaginative love tokens. This Brooklyn-based entrepreneur promises to put one pair of scented, gift-wrapped designer briefs in the mailbox for $ 16.50 each month. Men are the main purchasers of her hidden couture _ she estimates 95 percent of the subscriptions to her panty club have been bought by men. With more than 1,000 customers, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> makes sure the package and panty are `` color-coded to the season.'' Last year's April Easter pair had a `` furry, detachable bunny tail;'' the July `` firework special'' was, of course red, white and blue; and New Year's pair was silver silk. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said she hand-dyed 600 pieces of lingerie to a minty green for last St. Patrick's Day, her third-biggest sales period. This year, however, she found emerald satin panties trimmed with champagne lace. And do n't forget the optional `` Erin Go Bra'' bra. But <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>'s of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s $ 10 pair of musical panties is a tough contender. Cleverly hidden amid what little red-and-white lace makes up this undergarment, which a company spokeswoman described as `` very small,'' is a tiny computer box that can chirp out a rendition of `` Let Me Call You Sweetheart'' at the pull of a string. Though long considered outside the realm of high-class lingerie, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>'s has managed to spawn 150 stores nationwide and post annual sales in the $ 58 million range, spokeswoman <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Appel </PERSON> said. For those who want to be a bit more extravagant, <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is selling rhinestone-studded red silk panties for $ 100 a pair The matching camisole carries a $ 250 price tag. `` The idea of sleaziness is leaving the American scene,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Just look at how the square footage for lingerie in department stores is increasing.'' Indeed, the last few years have seen a `` coming out of lingerie as a real fashion item,'' said <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, a retail marketing consultant and publisher of the newsletter Retail Marketing Report. Over a year ago, for example, <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s flagship <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> store moved its lingerie department from the more pedestrian ground floor to upstairs, next to designer clothing, a spokeswoman said. `` The industry is growing rather fast,'' <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> said, pointing to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as one major retailer that has focused on lingerie with its 237-store <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>'s Secret chain. `` It's likely we'll see more and more stores affiliated'' with lingerie spinoffs, <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> predicted. The actual size of the industry is difficult to gauge, partly because many of the players are private companies and because the industry does not have a trade association. But <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McInerney </PERSON>, publisher of Intimate Fashion News, said his publication reported 1986 intimate apparel sales totaled $ 5.6 billion. While trailing sleepwear, which posted 1986 sales of $ 1.42 billion, and bras, which totaled $ 1.34 billion, sales of panties reached $ 1.1 billion and ranked ahead of robes, slips and girdles. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> finds panties the most essential item. She notes they come in `` the most colors and styles, they're the least expensive and most needed'' piece of intimate apparel. `` This year has spurred a major growth in pants,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, fashion editor for intimate apparel at Women's Wear Daily. She says there's a `` silhouette to fit any figure,'' from bikinis to petits pants. Even the G-string and its minisculely more generous sister, the `` thong'' panty, continue to rack up sales. `` I thought they would be a flash in the pan, but <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dior </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> are doing a very big business in them,'' she said.

<HEAD>Economic Reports Raise Inflation Fears, But Some Fear Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four months after the stock market collapse, the government on Friday reported a lower trade deficit, rising prices and mounting piles of unsold goods, baffling the markets over whether to expect inflation or recession. The confusion was first reflected in the inflation-sensitive bond market, where prices first soared and then sank in a half hour of wild gyrations. Stocks and the dollar rose. Interest rates finished the day higher in a setback for individual and corporate borrowers that some economists believe could tip the precariously balanced economy into recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the merchandise trade deficit shrank to $ 12.2 billion in December, the lowest figure since January 1987, even though the gap for all of 1987 totaled a record $ 171.2 billion. Exporting manufacturers are continuing to do a booming business, but demand for imports remains healthy as well, the trade report showed. The impression of a strong, potentially inflationary economy was heightened by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report that wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in January. The yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond _ an indicator for interest rates throughout the economy _ rose to 8.44 percent from 8.35 percent late Thursday as the bond's price sagged. Wall Street took the reports more favorably than the bond market as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 21.72 points to 1,983.26 one hour before the close of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The dollar strengthened about 1.2 percent percent against key currencies, rising to about 131 Japanese yen and 1.71 West German marks. Contrasting with the signs of economic strength was one sign of weakness: The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said business inventories shot up 0.8 percent in December, the third consecutive large monthly advance. The reports suggested that since the Oct. 19 stock plunge, the economy remains balanced on the knife edge between inflation, brought on by the improvement in trade, and recession, brought on by tight credit and sluggish consumer spending. Friday's jump in interest rates was interpreted by some economists as evidence that investors are confident about economic growth and concerned about the risks of inflation. In addition to the reports on trade and wholesale prices, the economy showed sparks of life in Thursday's report that retail sales rose 0.5 percent in January. `` We believe that there is enough strength in the manufcturing sector to prevent a recession. And if we get any strength in the consumer side, that's just gravy,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindewolf </PERSON>, associate economist for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. But other economists said the economy shows fundamental signs of weakness, such as the report that inventories of unsold goods are piling up on shelves. Investors are not especially worried about a resurgence of inflation, argued <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief fixed-income economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> Disagreeing with the prevailing interpretation, <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> argued that investors sold bonds Friday because they had been expecting a cut in the discount rate by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and did n't get it. <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> made a mistake by not cutting the discount rate, which would have made life easier for borrowers and resuscitated an ailing economy. `` When the patient has been pulled out of a pool, that's a good time to administer artificial resuscitation, rather than wait till he stops breathing,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. The increase in producer prices reported Friday was not large and followed three months of decline, <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said, arguing against the likelihood of zooming inflation. `` I'm concerned about what the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has done here; I do n't think it's good,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> economists believe Friday's reports confirm their view that the economy will continue to slog forward through 1988 and that a recession is not likely until 1989, said senior economist <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said he does not believe a discount rate cut is either imminent or needed.

 Millionaire industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> avoided a prison term for federal income tax evasion, but agreed Friday to pay $ 3 million to help <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s homeless, pay more than $ 4 million in back taxes and penalties and give 5,000 hours in community service over five years. The 69-year-old <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> businessman, whose holdings include controlling interests in Royal Crown Cola and <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, had little to say after the sentencing hearing, but told reporters: `` I've been involved in charity works all my life, and I've given millions and millions to charity. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> cautioned <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> in court: `` Not one dollar of the funds of this project are tax-deductible!'' <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> faced up to 40 years in prison after pleading no contest Sept. 29 to evading more than $ 1.2 million in federal taxes by inflating the value of land he donated to a Bible college as a tax exemption. A no contest plea is not an admission of guilt, only a statement that the defendant will offer no defense. For sentencing purposes, it is equal to a guilty plea or conviction. Aside from paying the $ 4 million in back taxes, penalties, interest and fines, <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> was ordered to pay the cost of his own prosecution. <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> said the homeless project will include <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> counties and he appointed a committee of civic leaders to determine how the money will be spent. The judge warned that failure to abide by the terms of the agreement could result in jail time for <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>. The judge directed that, as part of his community service, <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> spend five hours a day for one day each of the next eight weeks at <ORGANIZATION> Camillus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a downtown <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> mission for the homeless. During the hearing, <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, pleaded for an alternative to jail time. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> had always considered the tax case a civil matter. But the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> did not see it that way, and started a criminal investigation eight years ago. `` Because it is a unique case, it provides the court with an opportunity under which Mr. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> could give of himself and his resources for the benefit of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` There are matters crying out for remedy,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the court. `` It would serve no useful purpose to incarcerate this defendant. I appeal to your mercy and I appeal to your justice.'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartusciello </PERSON> argued that a jail term was necessary as a deterrent to others. `` Mr. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> lied to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and he corrupted others,'' he said. `` In his statement to the probation officers he makes the same claims and tells the same lies.'' `` He does n't show he's remorseful, that he's sorry. The honest taxpayers end up paying a disproportionate burden,'' the prosecutor said. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> entered the plea a month before he was to be retried. His 1986 conviction was set aside because of jury irregularities. He pleaded in September to 10 charges: conspiracy to evade income taxes, four counts of tax evasion and five counts of making false statements in a tax return. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> was indicted in 1982, accused of filing false returns between 1975 and 1979 and evading $ 1.2 million in taxes by inflating the value of property he donated to <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> real estate broker <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scharrer </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> was charged with aiding and abetting in the tax violations. He was convicted in 1984 and sentenced to 18 months. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s holdings also include controlling interests in <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Graniteville </LOCATION> textile company. He was named <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s highest-paid executive by Business Week magazine in 1985 The industrialist, who rarely grants public interview, reportedly earned $ 8.6 million in 1986 and his fortune was estimated at $ 240 million by <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. He has sold off holdings in recent years to pay company debts. His <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy law.

<DATELINE>CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> posted a $ 19.2 million third-quarter loss Friday after setting aside $ 22 million in reserves for possible future losses by its home-video division. A year ago, <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> ousted the three top executives of the home video operation, including its founder and president <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON>, amid allegations of conflict of interest. An internal probe has been under way since then. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>'s loss for the three months ended Dec. 31 narrowed from a loss of $ 21.7 million a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter rose by nearly 30 percent to $ 255.1 million from $ 196.8 million. The $ 22 million reserve is to cover potentially uncollectable accounts receivable and a writedown on the value of inventory because of overstocking some titles. For the nine months, <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> posted a loss of $ 82.6 million, which included a $ 45 million writedown on the value of the final five movies made by the ousted management of the film division. In the first nine months of 1986, the company lost $ 4.1 million. Revenue for the nine months were up 17.3 percent to $ 616.8 million from $ 525.7 million. Last November, <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> sued <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> charging that he breached his fiduciary duty in running the operation. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. Separately, <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> disclosed that it has had to reduce the sale price of of its New York-based advertising agencies _ <LOCATION> Bozell </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kenyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Eckhardt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Poppe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ by slightly over $ 10 million to $ 133 million. But the company said it is proceeding with sale to members of the agencies' management, with the deal expected to close within a week. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> will show a pre-tax gain of about $ 16 million on the deal.

<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that a group of commercial banks has arranged $ 2.2 billion in financing for the company's $ 2.1 billion hostile takeover attempt for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The syndidate is composed of 19 domestic and foreign banks, including <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which earlier pledged $ 750 million of its own funds toward the deal, the company said. American Standard has vowed to fight <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>'s $ 65-per-share bid, saying it will consider a restructuring, leveraged buyout or a friendly merger with another company The New York-based manufacturer of plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment has urged its shareholders to reject the offer and has adopted a `` poison pill'' plan allowing shareholders to buy back their stock at half market value if the takeover succeeds. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, which currently owns just 100 shares of the company, launched an effort Wednesday to oust <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors Shareholders will be asked to vote their shares to remove 10 members of the company's board, <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said. One of the objectives, the suitor said, was to remove the poison pill plan. The <LOCATION> Towson </LOCATION>, Md.-based tool and appliance maker also announced the expiration of a waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The law required a 30-day cooling off period to check for possible antitrust violations. `` The screening process is over and that means there are no antitrust implications,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said the agreements with the banks are for permanent financing of the takeover.

<HEAD>Governor Signs Takeover Protection Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> signed into law Friday emergency legislation that enables the state to assess the economic impact of takeover bids by foreign corporations. The law, which takes effect immediately and expires July 1, was prompted by <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s billion bid to acquire or merge with <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> is headquartered in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> is based in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. `` With the help of this bill, we will use every resource available to investigate the impact of this offer and take whatever action is necessary to prevent the loss of jobs in the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> area,'' <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> cautioned that any attempt by <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> to enter into agreements with other firms would be met with a `` vigorous legal challenge.'' In a letter to <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> of the leveraged-buyout firm of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> noted that it has been `` widely reported'' that <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> has expressed interest in <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said the firm `` can not enter into such arrangements without our having a full and fair opportunity to compete with any offer you make, including providing us with any information provided to you or any other third parties.'' Under <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s new law, foreign businesses trying to acquire an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> business are required to disclose financing plans and any intent to sell the target company's assets to pay for the acquisition. Companies must make the disclosure to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which is then authorized to conduct an economic impact review and also can involve other departments, including commerce and taxation. `` This legislation protects target corporations with a considerable presence in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> by requiring bidders to explain their financing plans,'' the governor said. <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said serious questions have arisen about the amount of debt involved in the transaction. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> attorney representing <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, said Thursday that enactment of the bill should send a signal to Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> has obtained some of the protection it wanted. A companion bill requested by <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> effectively has been put on hold. The measure would have expanded <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s existing anti-takeover law to include certain non-Ohio corporations licensed to do business in the state. But lawmakers said there were substantial constitutional questions and other concerns about the bill. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5.4 billion, $ 61-per-share offer to merge with <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> was made as an alternative to its outstanding $ 4.2 billion hostile tender offer. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> employs about 16,000 people in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and has a payroll of $ 237 million annually.

 Soybean futures prices leaped as much as 10 \ cents a bushel Friday as speculators sparked a final-hour surge on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> On other markets, grain futures were mixed; precious metals firmed; energy futures retreated and stock-index futures advanced. The soybean rally was kicked off by one large speculative firm, which began snapping up soybean futures and options contracts late in the session, analysts said. `` During the first two and half hours of the trading session, it was basically a liquidation market with prices easier following a runup during the week,'' said <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Luth </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Then it started rallying and rallying and ran up to new highs on the day,'' he said. The runup triggered computer-controlled buy stops, `` and up she went,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The August contract gained 10 \ cents a bushel <PERSON> Luth </PERSON> said the buying may have been linked to rising European demand for soybean meal. Corn prices retreated slightly on rumors the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to begin auctioning off surplus corn stocks in April, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. The program would supposedly be similar to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s successful weekly wheat auctions, begun in November, which increase the supply of grain on the open market. Wheat futures advanced in line with soybeans. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced substantial new export business, including new sales of wheat to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. Wheat settled 1 \ cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 3.32 \ a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents to 1 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.01 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with March at $ 1.90 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 10 \ cents higher with March at $ 6.27 Gold and silver futures posted their best gains in more than a week on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in apparent defiance of government trade figures released Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit had narrowed to $ 12.2 billion in December compared with $ 13.2 billion in November. The lower-than-expected number helped strengthen the dollar, which often leads to lower gold prices. Instead, gold futures gained more than $ 5 a troy ounce, perhaps in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that wholesale prices rose a brisk 0.4 percent in January, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> said Thursday's government report of a 0.5 percent rise in retail sales in January also may have helped the metals markets, which had been drifting lower on ideas the economy was slipping into a recession The increase in retail sales `` could suggest the economy is not going into recession and I think that is something the metal markets in general would view favorably,'' <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> said. `` The last thing they want to hear right now is anything having to do with recession.'' Gold settled $ 5.30 to $ 7.50 higher with the April at $ 448.70 a troy ounce; silver was 7.5 cents to 8.3 cents higher with March at $ 6.39 a troy ounce. Energy futures slumped on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in mostly technical trading, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said the charts continued to look weak, and he predicted further declines on Tuesday, when trading resumes after the holiday weekend. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> also said many traders were selling crude-oil contracts for March delivery and buying contracts for later delivery, an indication they expect oil prices to fall in the near term. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 31 cents to 34 cents lower with March at $ 16.77 a barrel; heating oil was .61 cent to .79 cent lower with March at 46.60 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .37 cent to .76 cent lower, with March at 46.28 cents a gallon. Livestock and meat futures ended mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on expectations of a surge in slaughters. Many traders expect livestock marketings to increase next week as milder weather moves into the Plains and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Norem </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Agri-Visor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Live cattle settled .18 cent lower to .10 cent higher with February at 71.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent lower to .15 cent higher with March at 83.30 cents a pound; hogs were .43 cent lower to .20 cent higher with February at 47.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .50 cent to .78 cent lower with February at 55.80 cents a pound Stock-index futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.55 points higher at 258.80.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Narrows, But Wholesale Prices, Inventories Rise</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Here, at a glance, are developments in the economic picture Friday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TRADE DEFICIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit narrowed to $ 12.2 billion in December, down from $ 13.2 billion in November and $ 17.6 billion in October. But the overall $ 171.2 billion shortfall for 1987 was the highest ever. Exports in December climbed 4.2 percent to a record $ 24.8 billion, while imports held steady at $ 37 billion, the same as the month before. Analysts credited the devalued dollar, which makes American goods cheaper abroad, for the recent export surge.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WHOLESALE PRICES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The steepest increase in food prices in nearly 18 months, partly offset by falling energy costs, pushed wholesale prices in January up 0.4 percent, equivalent to an annual rate of inflation of 4.6 percent. The rise followed three months of declines and was the largest since a 0.4 percent increase in September.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSINESS INVENTORIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Business inventories rose by $ 5.45 billion, or 0.8 percent, in December, following even larger increases of 0.9 percent in November and 1.1 percent in October. The large rise in inventories was led by a 1.5 percent increase in stockpiles held by retailers. Inventories held by wholesalers rose 0.6 percent, while manufacturing stockpiles were up 0.4 percent. Many economists say the swelling backlog of unsold products could retard growth in the coming months.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSINESS SALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Business sales rose 1.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 466.57 billion in December following two months of sluggish activity. Business sales fell a revised 0.4 percent in November, more than initially reported. The sales increase was paced by a 2.2 percent rise in sales by manufacturers. Sales by retailers were up 1.2 percent, while sales at the wholesale level were essentially unchanged.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>U.S. STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The stock market showed a moderate gain in a muted response to news of a smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The Dow Jones average rose 21.72 to 1,983.26, extending its gain for the week to 72.78 points.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DOLLAR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The dollar strengthened about 1.2 percent against key currencies, rising to about 131 Japanese yen and 1.71 West German marks.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>OIL PRICES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Oil prices moved lower, pulled down by technical factors and slumping prices in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, analysts said. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, contracts for March delivery of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, closed at $ 16.75 per 42-gallon barrel, down 36 cents from Thursday. Among refined products, wholesale heating oil contracts fell 0.75 cent to 46.60 cents per gallon, while wholesale unleaded gasoline sold for 46.28 cents per gallon, down 0.37 cent.

 The stock market gained ground in moderate trading Friday, mustering only a subdued response to news of a smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 21.72 to 1,983.26, extending its gain for the week to 72.78 points. Advancing stocks outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 among New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 937 up, 556 down and 473 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 177.19 million shares, down from 200.76 million in the previous session. Before the market opened the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $ 12.20 billion in December from $ 13.22 billion the month before. The figure came in at the low end of analysts' estimates, and lent support to the growing belief that the international trade situation was improving. American exports set a record for the second straight month. But analysts said traders in the stock and bond markets did n't see the news as purely positive Given the strength it showed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing, they said, the chances seemed less that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon relax its credit policy further. Interest rates rose and prices declined in the credit markets. Another apparent drag on the markets was the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.4 percent in January, after falling about the same amount in December As they had on last month's trade report, stocks registered just about all their gains in the first half hour of trading, and then spent the rest of the session drifting in a narrow range. Gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, up -RCB- at 112; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>, up -LCB- at 43 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, up ~ at 42 -RCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, up \ at 40 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, benefiting from upbeat appraisals of its earnings report early in the week, rose 1 -LCB- to 67 -LRB-. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inns </ORGANIZATION> paced the day's percentage gainers, jumping 7 -RRB- to 26 -LCB-. The company said it retained an investment banking firm to advise it on potential takeover offers that `` have or might be made.'' <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> climbed 5 \ to 45 The company said it was notified by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, the real estate developer and financier, that he had acquired a block of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> stock and might increase his stake to as much as 24.9 percent. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 15.74 billion, or 0.62 percent, in value.

 Belgian financier <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> Friday failed to push through a Franco-Belgian deal to control <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, giving rival Italian investor <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>'s bid a major boost. <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> could not get enough backing from a group of mostly Belgian investors to ratify an accord with the French holding <ORGANIZATION> Cie. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> to restructure <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s biggest holding concern and keep it anchored in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> said he considered his mandate as spokesman for the group as over. Because of the failure, the battle for control for <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, one of the pillars of the Belgian economy, remains open. <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>, however, said `` it is continuing discussions with all the Belgian shareholders'' wanting to cooperate in gaining control of the company that has a stake in a third of the Belgian economy. It said <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON>'s decision to relinquish his leading role `` absolutely does not call into question the goal sought by the Belgian and French partners'' to restructure the 166-year-old company. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> has interests in about 1,400 companies worldwide with assets totaling nearly $ 3 billion. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> did not comment on Friday's developments. He wants effective control of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> in order to use it as a platform for a pan-European financial holding. He also has offered to continue negotiations with the Belgian shareholders but has excluded Suez from such negotiations. The Italian investor claims to be the biggest shareholder and says he can control, through allies, 38 percent of stock in the company. He is launching a public offer Monday for 15 percent more. In the public offer, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> is willing to offer 4,000 francs -LRB- $ 114.30 -RRB- per share, 150 francs -LRB- $ 4.30 -RRB- less than Friday's closing price on the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> stock exchange The price had plunged 14 percent Friday from 4,850 francs -LRB- $ 138.60 -RRB- and brokers blamed it on <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON>'s failure, which caused many market participants to conclude <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> had won the battle for control. The group of mostly Belgian investors formed around <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> said it had 28 percent of stocks in the company while <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> claimed 15 percent. Together with allies <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> said they had a majority of shares. But important groups within the coalition did not support the accord. <ORGANIZATION> Cobepa </ORGANIZATION>, linked to <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Paribas </ORGANIZATION>, a French rival of <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>, has an estimated 4 percent of the shares of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> and said the plan lacked a clear industrial program. The Belgian group uniting beer brewers <PERSON> Artois </PERSON> and <PERSON> Piedboeuf </PERSON> also failed to agree to the terms. The accord was favored by the current management of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, which has come under sharp attack by <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>. Friday's developments followed a week of frantic negotiations between the three interested parties and threatened to defeat <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>'s bid to create a pan-European holding centered around the Belgian company.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall On Inflation Worries, Fading Hopes for Lower
Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices sagged Friday as hopes faded for continued declines in interest rates and concerns grew about inflation. The activity occurred against a backdrop of new government reports that included a smaller-than-expected December trade deficit and a rise in wholesale prices in January. By late afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond was off ~ point, or $ 8.75 for every $ 1,000 in face value. It rose more than $ 10 shortly after the trade report was released before quickly reversing course. Its yield climbed to 8.43 percent from 8.35 percent late Thursday. The government reported the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade imbalance fell to $ 12.2 billion in December from $ 13.2 billion in November. The report sent bond prices higher because the deficit was lower than many analysts had expected and indicated the gap could shrink without new declines in the dollar. A falling dollar discourages foreign investors such as the Japanese from buying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities. But the rise was shortlived as bond prices abruptly changed direction. Analysts said the reversal occurred because the market's attention shifted from the trade report to a second government report that wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in January after a 0.4 percent decline in December <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Boltz </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rowe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a Baltimore-based investment company, said the wholesale price numbers triggered some concerns about inflation, which would erode the value of bonds. At midday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> took steps for the second day in a row to arrange securities sales that had the effect of draining reserves from the banking system. Some analysts said that signaled the central bank had no intention of further relaxing its credit policy, and that it raised questions about whether it had eased its policy earlier this week as some economists believed it had. The federal funds rate, the closely-watched interest charge on short-term loans between banks, edged up to 6 11-16 percent from 6 -LCB- percent late Thursday. The rate is often seen as an indication of which way the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> wants short-term rates to go, and when it fell below 6 percent earlier this week, some economists concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had relaxed its credit policy. `` The market had gotten overexuberant on the possibility of further <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> easing ... but after the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> drained reserves, the funds rate kicked up. The prospect of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> easing is up in the air,'' said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, research director for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Late Friday afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> disclosed its policymakers decided in December to end aggressive efforts to push interest rates lower, believing that the immediate threat from the October stock market collapse had passed <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers met again Tuesday and Wednesday but did not disclose any results of their actions. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds on Friday, prices of short-term governments fell \ point, intermediate maturities dropped | point and 20-year issues fell 1 -LRB- points, according to figures provided by the financial information service <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.52 to 113.32. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, lost 5.47 to 1,185.17. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 1.31 to 282.65. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose 12 basis points to 5.75 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills rose 10 basis points to 6.01 percent and one-year bills gained 8 basis points to 6.25 percent.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit narrowed to $ 12.2 billion in December as exports hit new records, but the overall $ 171.2 billion shortfall for 1987 still measured the highest ever, the government said Friday. December's merchandise trade deficit was down from $ 13.2 billion in November and from $ 17.6 billion in October, and was the smallest figure since a $ 11.9 billion trade gap in January 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The improvement was driven by a 4.2 percent rise in exports, which reached record levels for the second month in a row. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 21.72 to 1,983.26, a subdued response to the trade report. Bond prices fell as concern grew about inflation, but the dollar soared against most major currencies. Both private and government analysts pointed toward the December report as strong evidence of the long-awaited reversal in the nation's trade peformance. `` The tide has turned,'' declared <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Exports in December were $ 24.8 billion, a new record, up from $ 23.8 billion in November, the previous record Imports, meanwhile, held steady at $ 37.0 billion, the same as the month before. `` We're beginning to see our economy driven by exports and that means economic vitality and increased jobs for Americans,'' Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> said in a statement. But he said the overall deficit for the year _ up 9.6 percent from $ 156.2 billion in 1986 _ was `` unacceptable. We have a long way to go until we can be comfortable.'' For all of 1987, Americans imported $ 424.1 billion in goods from other countries while exporting $ 252.9 billion, compared with 1986 imports of $ 383.0 billion and exports of $ 226.8 billion. Analysts credited the slide in the dollar _ now worth half of its 1985 value against the Japanese yen and key <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies _ as being the major factor in the recent export surge. A devalued dollar makes American goods cheaper abroad. And, while it will also eventually drive up the price of imports, this effect has not yet been fully realized as many foreign manfacturers take smaller profit margins to hang onto their share of lucrative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets, analysts said. Still other economists suggested that the December figures be looked at cautiously, claiming that the monthly trade figures _ although closely watched by financial markets _ tend to be erratic. For one thing, the figures are not adjusted to remove the impct of seasonal factors, such as increases in imports before Christmas and when new-model auto shipments come in early each summer. On a seasonal basis, the trade gap traditionally improves in December and January, economists said. To meet this concern, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced on Friday that, beginning with the release of April trade figures, it would `` seasonally adjust'' the monthly data. In other economic data on Friday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its Producer Price Index rose 0.4 percent in January, equivalent to an annual rate of inflation of 4.6 percent, with higher costs for a variety of items, including food, offsetting lower energy prices _ The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said business inventories shot up 0.8 percent in December, the third consecutive large monthly advance, pushing unsold stockpiles on shelves and backlots up by $ 5.45 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 701.87 billion Of the December trade figures, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said, `` This is a sign that there are better days ahead on the trade front.'' And <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, senior economist for <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, a bond brokerage, predicted that imports would soon begin to fall as sharply as exports have risen, `` as we work off the high level of import inventories.'' `` We're in the middle of a major change of course. But it's a big ship and you do n't turn around a big ship on a dime,'' <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON> said. `` At least we know we're headed home again.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continued to run its largest deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last year _ $ 59.8 billion, up from $ 58.6 billion in 1986. However, imports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in December held at their November level of $ 4.8 billion. Eclipsing Western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the first time as the second-largest trade deficit were the so-called four `` tigers'' of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the newly industrialized nations of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. Together, the trade deficit with those nations in 1987 rose to $ 37.7 billion, up from $ 30.8 billion in 1986. The deficit with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, meanwhile, narrowed to $ 30.2 billion from $ 32.7 billion in the previous year. Trade accounts with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ this nation's largest single trading partner _ also improved during 1987, to a deficit of $ 11.7 billion from $ 13.2 billion in 1986. For the full year, imports of manufactured goods rose 10.7 percent to $ 325.2 billion while exports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufactured goods rose 15.3 percent to $ 171.5 billion. Oil imports were up 19.1 percent, to $ 44.8 billion, as oil prices rebounded from their 1986 collapse. And in the only major category in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has consistently maintained a surplus, farm product exports were up 9.6 percent, to $ 28.6 billion. Automobile imports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> totaled $ 22.2 billion for the year, a 0.9 percent increase. But those from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> were down 13.5 percent to $ 10.2 billion. From all other countries, auto imports were up a sharp 32.2 percent, to $ 16.8 billion, reflecting popularity of model lines like the South Korean <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> automobile.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday the settlement of 16 lawsuits brought against the company and its directors in 1986 by <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> after it abandoned efforts to gain control of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>. The settlement, subject to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review, requires <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s non-employee directors to fully evaluate all takeover proposals and stock repurchase agreements for the next three years. The directors must also obtain advice from financial experts on takeover bids and make certain public statements about the offers. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> must pay up to $ 550,000 to cover legal fees as part of the settlement. Fourteen class action suits were filed by <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shareholders shortly after the company signed a November 1986 agreement prohibiting any attempts to takeover <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> for 10 years. Two other suits were filed in 1987 as amendments to the original suits. <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> made two offers for <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, the latest a $ 5.4 billion stock buyout bid in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> bought back from <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> about 24 million shares at $ 29.25 a share following the agreement, said <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fausch </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> had acquired 14 percent of stock from <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, which is presently facing a takeover attempt by New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Trump May Seek Up to 24.9 Pct of MCA</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> may seek up to 24.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, the entertainment conglomerate said Friday. It has been speculated for more than a year that <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> would be a takeover target, but until now no suitor has emerged. Some analysts have long contended the company's stock was undervalued. But it was believed a hostile takeover would be difficult because <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> is ruled with an iron hand by <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON>, the last of the old-line movie moguls. <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON>, 74, has been with <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> and its forerunner, <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, since 1936. In a brief announcement, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> said it had been notified by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> that he owns 375,000 of the company's shares and may seek to acquire 24.9 percent. <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> has 77.1 million shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement came after the stock market closed, but the company's stock already had jumped by $ 5.25 per share to $ 45 on rumors that a takeover bid was in the offing. Like most other companies, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>'s shares took a beating in the stock market crash and never fully recovered. In the past year, their highest price was $ 64.50. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Foerderer </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said she had no comment. <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> takeover speculation peaked in mid-1987 when <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> was hospitalized for a prolonged period after what was to have been routine surgery to remove a polyp from his colon. However, <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> did return to the helm of the entertainment giant after five weeks, reportedly with his corporate power undiminished. To dissaude suitors, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> last July adopted a `` poison-pill'' permitting stockholders to buy new shares at half price if a hostile bidder acquired more than 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> or made an unsolicited tender offer for more than 30 percent. <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON>'s control comes more from the respect he commands than from the stock he controls. <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> owns 6.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>'s stock and controls another 8.9 percent through a series of trusts, including those of the family of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>. From its beginning as a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> talent-booking agency, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> has grown into a powerhouse in producing movies, television programming, records and toys. It operates a successful backlot tour of <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> here, is building one in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and has agreed to build one in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In all three locations, it would be competing with theme parks by its arch-rival <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> also is involved in book publishing, retail and mail-order businesses In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 137.9 million, or $ 1.97 per share, a decrease of 9 percent from a year earlier when it netted $ 150.9 million, or $ 1.97 per share. The decline would have been even more dramatic except that the 1986 results already were depressed by a $ 50 million writeoff to cover bills it was unlikely to collect from independent television stations that had used <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> programs. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who made his fortune in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate, is building a casino empire with two hotel-gaming houses already in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and a permit pending for a third one. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> also is seeking to gain total control of <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He already owns 90 percent of the company's voting power. In addition, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> in the past has acquired stakes in takeover targets and later sold them for a handsome profit.
