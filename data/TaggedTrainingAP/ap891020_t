<HEAD>Mother Throws 3-Week-Old Baby From Third-Floor Window</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 A 3-week-old girl survived being thrown out of a third-floor window by her mother Friday when she landed in mud left by days of steady rain, authorities said. `` She has a skull fracture, she appears to have a femur fracture and we're concerned about intra-abdominal injuries,'' Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. `` I think she is a very, very lucky baby.'' <PERSON> Salonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> originally was listed in critical condition at Children's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, but her condition was later upgraded to serious. The child's mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 22, was led out of the apartment complex smiling and talking to herself as neighbors jeered. As she was placed in a police squad car, she turned toward television cameras and said `` My, I feel good.'' She was to be arraigned in <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Saturday on charges of assault with intent to kill, officials said. `` She has not indicated why'' she threw the infant out of the window, Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, a spokesman of the district police department said. `` But we believe that she has some very strong religious beliefs. We are still in the process of investigating that particular aspect.'' A security guard at the apartment complex initially thought the baby had been killed in the fall and put a coat over the body. The little girl was rushed to the hospital after a neighbor lifted the coat and the baby cried.

 News organizations that used unidentified sources to erroneously link a sailor to the explosion that killed 47 crewmen on the USS Iowa will be challenged in court to identify those sources, the sailor's attorney said Friday. `` We are going to name several media outlets as defendants for the untrue and defamatory accusations that came out immediately after the explosion,'' attorney <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>' annual convention. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> represents <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, who the attorney said was identified in stories following the April gun turret explosion aboard the battleship as a homosexual friend of one of the sailors, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> died in the blast. Last month, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report citing circumstantial evidence said <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was the most likely person to have caused the explosion. Stories on the Hartwig-Truitt link cited unidentified sources. `` We know who the sources are,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. `` The sources will deny. It'll be an interesting exercise.'' He said the news organizations, which he would not identify, would refuse to name the sources or invoke First Amendment protections. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said defendants who do n't reveal a source will have to pay damages because under the law that means there is no source and `` they just made it up.'' `` They're going to have a tough choice,'' he said. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, who also appeared on the panel to discuss whether the press went too far in covering the investigation of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> explosion, said <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was a friend but denied any homosexual relationship. `` I understand the public has a right to know and the press a right to print,'' he said. `` But whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty? Incredible. It's as if the press has immunity. `` Through leaks in the press, my life has been ruined forever.'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said as recently as the past week, he has been written about in newspapers as being dead. `` We all want to be fair,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. `` But there is supposed to be a balance.'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>, a board member of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the group's <ORGANIZATION> Bar-Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said a key question in developing such stories is whether reporters can trust the government. `` I think that question can be answered very clearly,'' she said. `` I think the government has a natural interest in lying.'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> contends <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> negligence, outmoded technology, unstable gunpowder and an untrained crew were responsible for the explosion. `` From the point of view of the government employee who was leaking the information, I believe the sources that leaked to the media did it intentionally to take the focus away from the fact that the battleship is an armored dinosaur and is no longer an effective weapon of war,'' he said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McMasters </PERSON>, deputy editorial page editor for USA Today and national freedom of information chairman for the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>, defended pursuit of stories by using unidentified sources. `` Some things will never come to fruition if there is n't public pressure to know the whole story,'' he said, adding that reporters need to know the motive for government leaks. `` You have a responsiblity as a journalist to let the audience know what side of the street your leak is on,'' he said.

 As northern Californians added up earthquake repair bills in the billions of dollars, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Californians </ORGANIZATION> lined up to plop down $ 21 apiece to be shaken and scared by a fake shake. The attraction: the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tours </ORGANIZATION>' simulated earthquake, which officials had closed for two days after Tuesday's deadly temblor devastated the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area When the attraction reopened Friday morning, thousands braved a light, chilly rain to clamber aboard trams and see what they might have missed. Or, in the case of northern Californian <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>, to be shaken again. `` It bounced me all over my driveway,'' she said of Tuesday's quake that rattled her <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION> home `` I've lived in that house for 32 years and it's the strongest one I've ever felt.'' But it was n't enough to keep her from canceling a trip to <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and a long-planned visit to the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tour </ORGANIZATION> and its simulated earthquake ride. `` I came clear down here to see this,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> said excitedly afterward. `` If they had canceled it, I would have been very disappointed.'' None of those interviewed Friday seemed bothered that the fake quake is supposed to happen in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, or that they had just witnessed a giant tanker truck hurled through the air as a roadway fell in a staged scene similar to Tuesday's deadly collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s Nimitz Freeway. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McClaskey </PERSON>, who went through <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Sylmar </LOCATION> quake in 1971, dismissed the irony with a wave of his hand. `` Nah, it's all in fun,'' said the retired trucker who now lives in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` This place is all make-believe. People can separate reality from fantasy.'' `` I thought it was great, especially when the -LRB- freeway -RRB- bridge came down,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolent </PERSON>, one of a group of teen-agers who bounded from the tour tram talking excitedly about the ride. `` But I do feel sorry for the people of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> of <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said he was `` kind of sad'' he had n't been home in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for the real thing He was at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Surin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutawaniatana </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, said he would have missed the attraction if the real quake had n't hit. `` We were going to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>,'' he said of his tour group. `` But when they canceled that part of the trip we got to come here instead.'' He added he was thrilled with the ride. `` I had heard it's great, and it was,'' he said. Even so, tour operators were taking no chances at offending anyone. While visitors were threatened by a robotic giant shark from the movie `` Jaws,'' shot at by actors dressed as space aliens, and buried in a make-believe avalanche, the comic patter of tour guides ran apace. But it halted as the tram was about to enter a sound stage made to look like a <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> subway tunnel. `` For those of you who do not want to experience this, we perfectly understand,'' a tour guide said solemnly over a microphone as he gave any of the more than 200 tram riders an opportunity to get off. One woman did. `` That is not a regular thing,'' Universal spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullard </PERSON> said of halting the tram before the fake quake. `` We are doing it today and perhaps this weekend.'' When the tram finally entered the set, several people braced themselves. `` It's only make-believe,'' one woman cautioned her son. Several riders applauded when the quake was over, but some veterans of real quakes expressed mild disappoint. They noted the ride did n't last long enough or shake violently enough to match the real thing. `` I liked the avalanche better because it really gave you the feeling you were falling,'' Tolent said.

 From elementary school students who gave $ 60 in crayon money to a foundation that donated $ 1 million, the world rallied to help <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area residents dig out and get on with their lives. People gave blood, a home improvement store donated shovels, trash cans and gloves, a cruise service sent passenger boats, a bank bought tons of meat, and a trade group collected a truckload of fruits and vegetables. `` Amazing is a pretty good word for all this,'' said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. By Friday evening, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> alone had received at least $ 8 million in pledges. A relief drive that started after Tuesday's quake with a brewery filling beer cans with drinking water and radio stations asking listeners for donations escalated through the week to a scale that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> charities called unprecedented for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> disaster. One of the biggest donations came Friday from the Los Angeles-based <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> foundation, funded by the estate of the late engineer, which gave $ 750,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and $ 250,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is n't something we do every day,'' said Executive Director <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisley </PERSON>. `` It was a desire to show the people of northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that the private sector and people in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> care about their needs.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, also offered $ 1 million, and the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it was donating $ 300,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and $ 200,000 to the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-based </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 1 million grant program to help communities rebuild. The bank also planned to give a $ 250,000 grant to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Other donations measured up in heart, if not dollars. First - and second-graders at <ORGANIZATION> Tierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oxnard </LOCATION> decided that the $ 60 they raised in a recycling drive for crayons, felt pens and chalk should go to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> for earthquake relief Two <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, radio stations raised $ 40,120 in an all-day pledge-a-thon. And a <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>, hairstylist announced she would hold a cut-a-thon Sunday and donate the $ 5-a-head proceeds. The <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiropractic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> offered its services, too. But relief officials worried that the aid was insufficient to fill all of the immediate needs of what could be the most expensive natural disaster in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. One estimate put the damage total at as high as $ 10 billion. `` We need cash, first and foremost. Because of who we are, we can stretch your dollars,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> chapter in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. People left homeless or displaced by the earthquake need things that only money can buy, such as new glasses, prescription medicines and false teeth. By Friday morning, 5,000 people were housed in 30 shelters in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. An estimated 12,550 people were displaced in all, according to the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Although aid came from around the world _ including offers of help from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ some of the most enthusiastic responses came from Californians, especially quake-nervous Southern Californians. Fullerton-based <ORGANIZATION> HomeClub </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a chain of home improvement stores, donated about 200 shovels, 600 trash cans and 2,500 canvas gloves to the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Catalina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruises </ORGANIZATION> sent four of its 700-passenger ships from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area to ferry people and supplies between <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> purchased more than 1,200 pounds of meat from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION> and had it transported from the bank's <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> headquarters to the <ORGANIZATION> Moscone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Food also was sent to the quake victims by the Fresh Produce Council. The trade group's officials phoned around to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area wholesalers and were able to collect 4,500 pounds of fruits and vegetables, enough to fill a tractor-trailer. `` The response was just phenomenal,'' said council Executive Vice President <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLyber </PERSON>. `` The wholesalers all rallied around the cause. And in one hour we had the shipment.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> nixed two joint performances by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bands, but promoters say they do n't see the concerts causing a security breach and are fighting to reverse the decision The 200-member Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble, including the 40-piece band, is scheduled to perform Oct. 24 in the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION> during its first tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Easterday Promotions suggested that the 35-piece <ORGANIZATION> Sand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> appear in a free <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> performance with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> the same day, said owner <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Easterday </PERSON>. She also worked to arrange a joint appearance of the Soviet band with the 35-piece <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> band in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> on Oct. 26. Both Sand Point and Fairchild authorities were enthusiastic, <PERSON> Easterday </PERSON> said, but Cmdr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> at Sand Point said officials had to submit the proposal to the Pentagon. On Wednesday, about two weeks after <PERSON> Easterday </PERSON> started promoting the events, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rejected the joint appearances. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> said he did n't know why the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rejected the idea. <PERSON> Easterday </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official, Capt. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> McUrrach </PERSON>, told her the two countries had restrictions on the movement of military personnel in each other's countries. The promoters were baffled. `` It's just an innocent half hour for the bands to get together,'' said <PERSON> Easterday </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON>. `` It seeme really strange.'' Easternday asked the office of Sen. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON> for help and the Republican lawmaker's <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> office started contacting <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials on Friday. `` Slade is convinced that this is a good event to have and we're seeking to have the decision reviewed at the least and at best reversed,'' said <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON> `` We're hoping that message has gotten through but we do n't know.'' McUrrach could not be reached for comment Friday evening.

 Opera singer <PERSON> Enrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON>, asleep in the Palace Hotel when the Great Earthquake struck in 1906, was so unnerved by the shaker that he ran into the streets in his nightie shouting, `` I'll never come back.'' He caught a ferry to <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and never did return. But the artists, actors, musicians and performance managers who experienced Tuesday's big quake vowed their shows would go on _ eventually, somewhere. Some of the promises could n't be kept. `` The music or the arts, what they're about is the spirit of life. ... It imparts something uniquely human; it kind of reminds people that there a great richness to being alive,'' said singer-performer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> of the Talking Heads, who is touring to promote his new solo album `` Rei Mommo.'' After watching television reports of the earthquake while backstage in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> canceled this week's shows at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Warfield </PERSON>. The concerts were rescheduled to Saturday night and moved to the Greek Theater in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, but the likelihood of rain later forced a cancellation there. Ticketholders were offered refunds. Elsewhere in the city, the cultural center of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, performers struggled through traffic jams and cordoned-off sections of the city to attend rehearsals. All 106 members of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION> made it to a 7 p.m. rehearsal Thursday, including 17 who battled enormous traffic snarls on the east side of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` We have a big responsibility to the community to energize, give them the impetus to get on with their lives,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, a 31-year-old clarinetist with the symphony. `` The show in general must go in, meaning life.'' On the rock scene, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>'s weekend concerts were postponed until December; <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s Sunday concert was indefinitely postponed; <PERSON> Oingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Boingo </PERSON>'s concert Sunday in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> was canceled, and <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicks </PERSON>'s concert Friday night was opened to ticketholders from Tuesday's canceled performance. `` It does n't seem quite right to produce an event in the middle of a catastrophe, having people walk by buildings that have just been condemned,'' said rock impresario <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who canceled nine concerts after the quake. Theatrical productions were disrupted, but most shows were to resume early next week. Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> encouraged <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area art institutions to reschedule performances soon, but cautioned them not `` rush to open before people are ready, otherwise it would e a distraction rather than a relief.'' The Friday and Saturday night premieres of the traveling musical `` Les Miserables'' were canceled after a water tank atop the Curran Theater broke and drenched the stage. At the landmark Geary Theater, the American Conservatory Theater's production of `` Right Mind,'' a multi-media presentation, was ended after a giant light rack crashed onto the stage and large plaster chunks fell from the ceiling. A recording for people holding ACT tickets warned theater-goers: `` Be careful out there.'' The troupe's upcoming production of a `` Tale of Two Cities'' may be postponed, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, ACT managing director. Classes for 200 students at ACT's prestigious drama school were postponed through Monday. Stairwell damage to the Golden Gate Theatre forced cancellation of the musical `` Durante'' through Tuesday. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>'s performance of <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` Idomeneo'' on Tuesday was canceled after windows and the glass front door blew out of the War Memorial Opera House. The opera moved out of the baroque War Memorial Opera House while structural engineers continued to check the building, whose seats were littered with chunks of ceiling plaster. Performances were moved at least through the weekend to the <ORGANIZATION> Masonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION>, where only soloists would be in costume. Productions there would have no scenery and a minimum of props. `` If the mundane things are not going on, at least the spiritual things are continuing,'' said <PERSON> Lotfi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansouri </PERSON>, general director of the opera, which in its 57-year history had never had a change of venue. `` We want to rally the people, and get them to look to rebuilding. Our function is to prove to everybody that the spirt of the city goes on.,'' The opera and the symphony will give a free joint concert in Golden Gate Park on Sunday, performing <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s Ninth Symphony `` It's a work that contains every emotion; despair, happiness, tragedy, hope and joy,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastreich </PERSON>, executive director of the symphony. `` We think all of those feelings of a disaster are there in this music.'' Most of the art museums in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> suffered only slight damage to priceless collections, but at least 33 pieces at the Asian Art Museum were damaged, for a loss estimated in the millions, according to <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangraw </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mumma </PERSON> said a 4-foot-tall jade figurine toppled in its case and was broken into several hundred pieces. He did not have a loss estimate. `` A lot of the pieces, even if they have a dollar value, you ca n't replace,'' he said. `` You may have the money, but you do n't have the object.

Federal investigators last month accused <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> of stealing more than $ 1.1 billion from his savings and loan through illegal loans and phony real-estate and tax transactions. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and four other senators have come under criticism for intervening with federal regulators two years ago during an investigation of <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> has made donations to <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> totaling $ 234,000. <PERSON> Oliphant </PERSON> said, `` It had to do with a judgment as to which person would stand up better in front of a battery of 500 microphones if it ever came to that.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> refused through an aide to comment on the book and a book on the savings and loan scandal, `` The Big Fix,'' that recounts <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>'s involvement on <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s behalf. `` The senator has n't read these books,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said. `` We just are not going to comment on excerpts from a book.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chose Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, as his running mate after campaign aides argued <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> was a less reliable candidate because of questions about his finances, the book says. At the time, news organizations were reporting <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> as the front-runner for the No. 2 spot, citing sources in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> has acknowledged a long relationship with <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, but denied any wrongdoing. The senator said he met twice with federal regulators in April 1987 at <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s request after <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> complained the investigation of his business was taking too long, but backed off after learning the probe could lead to criminal charges. Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman who conducted the final interviews with both <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, disputed the book's assertion that <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>'s demeanor under questioning threw the nomination to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` I disagree with the author and if he got it from a top aide, I disagree with the top aide,'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> acknowledged the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign throughly reviewed what he called `` the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates, what they would add to the campaign, what kind of vice presidents they would be.''

 A sheriff's deputy was killed and his partner wounded Friday as they tried to arrest a man on a drug charge, and the suspect held police at bay for nearly nine hours, authorities said. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzella </PERSON>, 30, whose home in this <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> suburb was surrounded by more than 100 law enforcement officers, surrendered at 10:20 p.m., ending a standoff that began at 1:30 p.m. <PERSON> Manzella </PERSON> was charged with first-degree murder, said <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. <PERSON> Manzella </PERSON>, who was inside the house alone, had been talking by telephone with police negotiators, but contact was broken off at 8 p.m., said county Undersheriff <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>. As the standoff continued, power to the neighborhood was shut off. The dead deputy was identified as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillemuth </PERSON>, 45, of <PERSON> Depew </PERSON>. His partner, Deputy <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, was in serious condition with a gunshot wound at <ORGANIZATION> Millard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fillmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suburban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, hospital officials said.

Both deputies were apparently hit by gunfire outside the house, <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said.

 Parachutists' plans to jump off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gorge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> are up in the air while the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> considers whether to ban this year's Bridge Day leaps. <PERSON> Ranger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Thursday the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> would have to drop 6 feet for the jumps to go off as scheduled on Saturday in the 10th annual event. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Velie </PERSON>, a board member of the <ORGANIZATION> Fayette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said he still hopes the river will subside in time for the jumps off the bridge, 876 feet above the river. But he said even if the jumping is canceled, Bridge Day events such as an arts and crafts exhibit would be held. Bridge Day attracts divers worldwide and is the largest event of the year for parachutists belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BASE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. State police will reroute the northbound lanes of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 19 during the event and allow pedestrians to walk on the highway. Bridge Day is the only time parachutists can legally jump from the bridge. `` It's relatively safe,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Boenish </PERSON>, executive director of BASE _ which stands for people who jump off buildings, antennas, spans and earth forms. `` Our volunteer staff is experienced BASE jumpers and they help divers chose the right gear and show them the right techniques,'' said <PERSON> Boenish </PERSON>, who also coordinates the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> jumps. Three people have been killed in parachute leaps from the bridge, two during the Bridge Day festivities. The last death was in 1987. Some state officials talked of banning the event following the accidents, but event organizers say Bridge Day provides the divers with a safe outlet. The event began in 1980 with a handful of jumpers. Last year, more than 100,000 people turned out to watch 300 divers perform 600 jumps from the center of the bridge.

 Early estimates that more than 250 people were killed under the collapsed Nimitz Highway were proving to be high, but no new estimates were offered, authorities said. Rescue workers found cars separated by as much as 60 feet, rather than bumper-to-bumper as feared. Authorities had said more than 270 people were killed by Tuesday's earthquake _ 250 of them during the Nimitz cave-in. That was based on an estimate of how many vehicles would have been crushed when the upper level of the freeway collapsed onto the lower level and an estimate of one person per car. `` Now they are going lower, much lower in fact,'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Covington </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. `` What's happening is that they are finding fewer vehicles under the bridge than they thought.'' Reaching the vehicles has been painstakingly slow because of a fear that huge sections of the interstate could collapse further on rescue workers. `` We're not going to give any estimate,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coronor's office. `` I do n't know how many people are there We're not going to know until they dig them out.''

<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has decided long briefs are on the way out for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> attorneys and court clerks. But the high court was n't making a fashion statement Thursday. Beginning in January 1991, the state's court system will no longer use legal-sized paper _ 8 -LCB- by 14 inches _ in any documents, including lawsuits, pleadings, notices, opinions, judgments and motions. The change mirrors rules in the federal courts and at least 36 other states. The new rule actually takes effect in January 1990, but the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decided to allow a one-year grace period during which the state's courts can accept either the legal size or standard 8 -LCB- - by-11 paper For years, a group called Eliminate Legal-Size Files _ or <LOCATION> ELF </LOCATION> _ has campaigned to get government to use the standard size. <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullarkey </PERSON>, a retired certified records manager for the state <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, was chairman of <ORGANIZATION> ELF </ORGANIZATION> for five years. `` It's just standardization. If everybody in the army fired a different size weapon, they'd have a hell of a time fighting a war,'' <PERSON> Mullarkey </PERSON> said. He said advantages to using just one size include having uniform filing cabinets and savings from buying a single size in bulk rather than two sizes. When the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> first proposed the rule in April, there was some understandable criticism, said <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, clerk of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` It seems like most of the opposition came from people who were selling legal-size paper and cabinets,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Scotch, SPAM and Rice are Big Black-Market Sellers in South Korea</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> buy six times as much Chivas Regal scotch as the much larger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ but instead of drinking it, they're selling it on the Korean black market, a study says. SPAM, Aqua Net hair spray and rice are among other favorites selling in huge quantities at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military commissaries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, apparently bound for the black market, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Such sales far exceed what would normally be consumed by the 70,000 authorized buyers stationed there, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers are footing part of the bill, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> witnesses said at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> is <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative arm. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> exports duty-free goods to bases in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and other countries for sale at cut-rate prices in the commissaries and exchanges. In 1988, commissaries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> sold 1.1 million cans of SPAM, or almost 12 pounds per person per year; 34 pounds or 816 American cheese slices for every man, woman and child, and 170 pounds of rice for every consumer. `` If one person consumed 170 pounds of rice a year, that would be a little over 14 pounds of rice a month or just under a half a pound of rice a day,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on government oversight and management `` There would be little room in a person's diet for anything else but rice,'' he said. Black marketeers recruit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> service members or their dependents to buy the products for later resale or enlist the help of cashiers and sales clerks, mostly Koreans. The investigators concluded that most of the Chivas Regal scotch purchased for sale, including the 12-year-old bottle and 21-year-old bottle, ends up in the black market. In 1988, service members in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> bought 314,748 liters of the scotch. `` Fewer military members in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> _ 15 percent of the total in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ purchased more than six times the number of Chivas Regal bottles purchased in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' the investigators said. In addition, the meat merchant who services the <ORGANIZATION> Osan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> told investigators that 70,000 pounds of oxtails are supplied per month to the commissary. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Heivilin </PERSON>, director of logistics issues for the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, said Korean tariffs make the price of legally imported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods very expensive. <PERSON> Heivilin </PERSON> told the subcommittee the cost of serving the black market was about $ 7 million a year, assuming that 20 percent of the $ 250.4 million worth of items sold in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1988 ended up in the cupboards of unauthorized individuals. `` This is totally abhorrent, totally unacceptable,'' said <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, who has called for a reduction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristoff </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative for <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, acknowledged that <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s restrictive import practices have fueled the black market. But she stressed that the Korean black market has been in existence for some time, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is taking steps to reduce the illegal sales. `` In July of 1988 our cigarette agreement with <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> went into effect, permitting the importation of cigarettes without restraint,'' she said. `` Black market activity in this product has dropped off significantly since then.'' To solve the problem, <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> has suggested elimination of the ration control system in which service members with no dependents are limited to $ 500 per month and those with dependents $ 800 per month. Another option is convincing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> `` to open its doors to these high-demand consumer goods,'' he said.

<HEAD>Colombian Drug Trafficker's Sentence Overturned on Nationality Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court overturned the 12-year prison sentence of a Colombian drug trafficker on grounds that a lower-court judge wrongly considered the man's nationality in determining punishment. The three-member appeals panel on Thursday returned the case of <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Borrero-Isaza </PERSON> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> for resentencing. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that a sentence may not be based even partly on a defendant's nationality, noting that <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> penalized <PERSON> Borrero </PERSON> more harshly than a non-Colombian co-defendant. <PERSON> Borrero </PERSON> was convicted of conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute cocaine after he was arrested in 1986 with more than two pounds of the drug in his car. During sentencing, <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> repeatedly told the defense attorney that he wanted to show people in cocaine-exporting countries that they would be harshly punished if they shipped drugs to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Somehow the people who are selling narcotics, particularly from source countries, have to know that we in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> mean business, and we are going to put a stop to this,'' <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said at the time. `` I want people in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to know it is not going to be tolerated.'' The appeals court said that while it is appropriate to consider `` the fact that a criminal has trafficked in drugs originating from a source country like <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' a defendant's nationality is irrelevant. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lind </PERSON>, a co-defendant who pleaded guilty in the case, received a seven-year sentence from <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>.

 Senate concern about freedom of speech and a cooling of the summer's political passions combined to defeat the proposed constitutional amendment to ban flag burning, lawmakers say. `` I do n't know that public interest has faded; I think that public interest has changed,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., said Thursday after the proposed amendment failed in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Opponents of the measure said Americans are having second thoughts about the notion of changing the Constitution. White House lobbying appeared minimal despite a strong public campaign that last summer took President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the foot of the Iwo Jima Memorial. The measure did win a bare majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, 51-48, but fell 15 votes short of the required two-thirds of senators present and voting. Eleven Republicans joined 37 Democrats to oppose the measure. Thirty-three Republicans and 18 Democrats voted for the proposal, which would have authorized the state and federal governments to outlaw flag desecration. Following the vote, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` disappointed'' and believes such an amendment represents `` the only ... real protection for the flag.'' She said a bill sent to the president last week to ban flag-burning by statute `` would not survive constitutional scrutiny.'' Critics of the amendment, in contrast, said the bill would satisfy concern in the country about flag-burning. `` I think when the statute passed, it made it much easier to focus on the Constitution,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt. `` But this amendment should fall anyway because of the danger it poses to the Bill of Rights. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, a strong supporter of the amendment, told reporters that `` the public was confused on this.'' `` They were led to believe a statute would do the job and produce results,'' he said. `` Now we do n't know what we've got if anything.'' Supporters of the amendment claimed it was the only sure way to prevent a recurrence of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in June that overturned the conviction of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag-burner <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> on grounds his right to free speech was violated. `` We all lose with this action,'' said <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Eplin </PERSON>, national commander of the American Legion, after the vote. `` Today, I feel like my friends have been let down, as well as those from other generations who died believing that our nation would always remember their sacrifices and respect the foremost symbol of all they held dear.'' Critics said there would be a political price to pay at election time for opposing the measure. At the same time, though, they seemed increasingly emboldened to attack the amendment as a threat to the Constitution. `` We face no sudden or uncontrollable burst of flag destruction,'' Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, declared. `` ... Yet we are being asked to believe that the flag which neither <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> could defeat is now threatened by a single misguided person who most Americans never heard of and do n't care about. Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., took the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor on Thursday morning to make one last appeal for approval of the measure He painted a colorful panorama of flag history from Iwo Jima to the lunar landing and said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was too bogged down in technicalities. `` The need for this amendment will not be found in a textbook or a treatise on constitutional law,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` No, it will be found in the emotions of the heart, emotions deeply rooted in the real-life experiences of millions of Americans, and emotions that are crying out today to give the flag real and lasting protection.'' Afterward, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said: `` I think the flag should be flown at half-staff after this vote.'' <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, initially co-sponsored the proposal, but both did an about-face on Tuesday and became opponents. `` When I was originally asked to support it, I thought, I want to protect the flag,'' <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said. `` ... But as the vote got closer and as I started reflecting on it and getting more serious about it, my opinion became one of the greatest reluctance to change the Constitution.''

 Earthquake-damaged homes collapsed under the prodding of powerful aftershocks Thursday, renewing fears among hundreds of residents already too horrified to go indoors. `` The whole neighborhood went outside. It's too scary inside when these things hit,'' resident <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said hours after the series of aftershocks struck this quiet agricultural community 70 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. More than 150 homes in the narrow coastal valley will likely be condemned, many of those dealt the ultimate blow during the aftershocks to Tuesday's destructive 6.9-magnitude temblor, said City Clerk <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. Preliminary estimates place damage at nearly $ 100 million _ some $ 24 million to homes and up to $ 75 million to industrial and commercial buildings. <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> is about 20 miles south of the epicenter of the quake. `` Some stores on Main Street probably have to be demolished,'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. The older brick and unreinforced concrete structures took the brunt of the latest shaking. The quakes were too much for the historical <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which withstood the 1906 quake With its underpinnings crumbling, demolition is considered a certainty. The violent rumbles sent chills through the 30,000 residents in the predominantly Hispanic community, part of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s so-called `` salad bowl'' region, where much of the nation's lettuce, asparagus and artichokes are Twenty miles northwest of <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, in the seaside city of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, authorities said as many as 10,000 people were believed to be homeless Thursday night. Also Thursday, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials closed all beaches in the city because of a sewage spill, and a strong aftershock that struck in the late afternoon caused more damage to a major highway already closed after Tuesday's temblor. Earlier in the day, a rescue team pulled the body of 23-year-old <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> from under two tons of rubble that rained down on her when a downtown <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> coffee store collapsed during Tuesday's deadly earthquake The discovery brought a tragic end to an emotional conflict between searchers and the woman's friends, who had insisted that Ms. <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> might be alive and criticized rescue efforts as too slow. Police said at least five people were arrested Wednesday night when they broke through a barricade at the site of the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> after being told that the search was being halted at dark. In <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said 400 to 500 residents sought refuge in shelters and another 500 were camping outside on lawns, in back yards, parks and empty fields. `` These people do n't want to go back home and do n't want to go to the shelters. They feel safer outdoors than in a building,'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Marcelina </PERSON> <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>, a 73-year-old woman wearing purple gloves and a felt beret, said she slept uneasily in a chair next to her front door and made frequent dashes outside whenever the earth moved. `` I ca n't stop shaking,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> said. `` I guess I'm surviving, but I'm scared. Many residents who emptied out of their broken homes spread across lawns and vacant lots like refugees. `` We're talking about people with no resources, no money for food and no money for health care,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Salud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gente </ORGANIZATION>, a state-funded community clinic. `` I think the big thing now is that the aftershocks are really scaring people,'' Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. Hundreds of people spent the night at local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelters and churches and more than 100 camped in a vacant downtown lot designated as the future site of the <ORGANIZATION> Watsonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have no place to live. The building cracked,'' said <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 36, who works in the lettuce fields. Thirty children romped on a pile of clothing nearby as <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> added, `` It's hard, especially for the kids, because we have no gas, water, special things for kids.'' At a shelter set up at a National Guard armory near the airport, scores of families sat on steel folding chairs and cots with blankets and clothing strewn everywhere. Earthquake victims also found food and shelter at St. Patrick's. Even though the red brick church was shattered by the quake, the Rev. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> voiced optimism during his Thursday sermon. He reminded his congregation gathered in another church building, `` The foundation of the church is Christ, and that's an unshakeable rock. ... We've just lost a house -LRB- the church -RRB-. We'll have to build a new house. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who also conducted prayer services at local shelters, said he found quake victims `` at peace and glad to have each other.'' `` I guess what I'll remember most about the shelters were the people clinging to each other _ they were clinging to the right things,'' he said.

<HEAD>Measuring Earthquakes, From Chinese Dragon Bowls to Laser Precision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Today sensitive instruments detect every tiny movement of the earth's crust, recording in detail disastrous earthquakes like the one in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Tuesday. These geological tools represent the ultimate refinement in a line that began almost 2,000 years ago with the ancient dragon bowl that dropped a ball when shaken. The first earthquake recording device was credited to the Chinese philosopher <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Heng </PERSON> in the year 132. He developed a bowl with dragon-shaped heads located at eight points around the outside. Each had a small ball balanced in its mouth; during an earthquake the ball dropped out, landing in the mouth of a toad statue located below. The location of a quake was supposed to determine which dragon dropped its ball, and the instrument was said to have recorded a quake 400 miles away that could not be felt by people near the bowl. J. de la Haute <PERSON> Feuille </PERSON> developed a similar device to record quakes in the year 1703, filling his bowl to the brim with mercury. In a quake, some mercury would spill on the side toward the quake. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Russ </PERSON>, assistant chief geologist at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>, said that in modern measuring devices, instruments near the center of an earthquake are knocked off their recording scale in a violent temblor, but readings can be calculated from the waves reaching more distant machines. Agency scientists at <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, near the site of Tuesday's deadly quake, are now collecting all available information on what happened. The basic tool today is a seismograph, an instrument developed in the late 19th century. Basically, it is a box with a frame attached to the ground that includes a suspended weight, which is able to swing. When an earthquake causes the frame to move, inertia forces the mass to lag behind and its swing is recorded by a pen and ink sweeping back and forth over paper. That pen trace is the commonly shown seismogram. These machines can be set for vertical or horizontal shaking and in modern machines the shaking produces an electrical signal which is amplified to drive a pen, allowing them to be much more sensitive than in the past. Over the years scientists have learned that earthquakes produce more than one type of wave, and that the different kinds move through the earth's crust at different speeds. By comparing the time of arrival of the different wave forms at a seismograph, scientists can determine how far away a quake occurred. Comparing the results at several locations allows them to calculate the exact position of the quake. While these are still the primary instruments used to measure quakes, geologists also have developed an array of other machines. For example, <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> pointed out that in parts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> fault, laser beams are used to measure land movement. The laser is placed on a hill and shines on a target located on the other side of a fault. Regular flashes of light allow the scientist to compare the time it takes for the light to travel between the two spots and thus calculate whether the light and target are moving relative to one another. Other instruments buried in the earth can sense the stresses placed on rocks. Measurements are also made of radon and other gases released by the earth and sensitive meters can even trace changes in the strength of gravity beneath the spots where they are located. A pendulum was first used to record a quake in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> in 1731, with <PERSON> Nichomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cirillo </PERSON> reporting that the amplitude of the swing decreased with distance from the quakes. Using a magnifier trained at the image of a cross hair, focused on a bowl of mercury, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallet </PERSON> was able to measure the speed of waves in the earth following dynamite explosions in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1851. <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON> installed a seismograph at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vesuvius </LOCATION> in 1856, but the instruments were brought into general use toward the end of that century by a group of British geologists headed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Milne </PERSON>, working in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Milne </PERSON> eventually managed to get seismograph stations set up around the world, collecting data at a central observatory for analysis.

<HEAD>Senate Vote Puts Abortion Matter in Sight of Bush Veto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The stage is set for a presidential veto of a bill allowing government-paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> put the matter in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hands Thursday when it gave final congressional approval to a spending bill including the new provisions for Medicaid abortions. The 67-31 vote drew little debate after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s surprise vote last week to approve the broader provisions. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the measure before, but final agreement on a compromise spending bill was needed to send the bill to the president. The measure would allow federal money to be spent on abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest and who `` reported promptly'' to law enforcement or public health authorities. Medicaid restrictions in the law since 1981 permit federal money for abortions only in cases where the life of the mother is endangered by her pregnancy. `` The president has told us he will veto this bill because he wo n't accept language that allows poor rape and incest victims access to abortions,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash. `` I'm sorry the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the most powerful man in the world, has chosen to veto this bill ... and thereby cause enormous additional suffering for some of the world's most unfortunate and powerless victims,'' he Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a Republican moderate, said 30 House Republicans have sent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a letter urging him to sign the bill. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opposition to the measure puts `` him and us in a really indefensible position.'' `` I would strongly urge the president to recognize that poor women have the right to make that same moral choice ... as rich women do,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. The abortion provision is part of a $ 156.7 billion measure to finance labor, health and education programs for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said last week he was looking for `` room for flexibility'' and did not wish `` conflict'' on abortion _ an issue that has been troublesome for him throughout his political career. But this week he hardened his stand and promised the veto, saying government financing of the abortions `` would compound a violent act with the taking of an unborn life.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he supports permitting abortions in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother but opposes having the federal government pay for the abortions in cases of rape or incest.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration does n't share the enthusiasm of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses eager to jump in for profit and excitement as Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seeks to reform a Marxist system lagging in productivity and consumer goods. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, speaking this week to the private <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, again stressed the view that lasting economic change must come from within; it can not and should not be provided by the West. Consumer shortages are unlikely to be relieved nor productivity increased without a stable currency, free and competitive markets, private property and real prices, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` The very logic of perestroika requires that the Soviets themselves must solve their own problems in a comprehensive, organic way,'' he said. But American businesses are charging in nonetheless. Fifty new posts are being added to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to assist them in grappling with Soviet bureaucracy and a legal system that is in such flux that entrepreneurs are having a rough time seizing capitalistic opportunities. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may be changing the way Soviet bureaucrats and ordinary citizens think about the marketplace, but historically people who have lived all their lives under Marxism are not risk-takers. The Soviets also do not have the cash to pay for American-built enterprises, nor the goods to barter for them _ with the exception of such items as oil, gold, diamonds and furs that the Soviets prefer to sell for themselves on world markets. And yet about 4,000 American companies are trying to do business in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, compared to less than 100 before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> assumed power in 1985. A thousand joint ventures have been signed and registered, but only a dozen or so deals have been struck. The most picturesque: McDonald's and Pizza Hut soon will be selling fast food to Russians. The foreign investment is relatively small, averaging about $ 1 million a venture. Still, American businessmen look at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as the last great untapped market, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coudert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> lawyer who last year opened the first <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> office for an American law firm. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said Thursday that under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> the Soviets have bent over backwards to liberalize their joint venture laws. But he described other laws that govern American investors as `` very uncertain territory.'' Often, he said, Soviet laws are not available to the public. `` Either they are state secrets or nobody can find them,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said at a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade relations. Getting approval for projects also is a huge problem for Westerners. `` This is a business culture that is sort of fused with a political culture,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. Moreover, the general atmosphere in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is hazy. Soviet law is in the midst of a major overhaul. The right to strike, ownership of property, freedom of assembly and speech are among the fundamental issues being debated in the Supreme Soviet. This carries a risk for American businesses, which prefer stability and certainty. And yet, there is a trend under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to promote domestic benefits for the Soviet people. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is prepared to give up a hotel site if the foreign partner is willing to arrange financing to rebuild a factory outside the capital, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. `` This is a good thing, and it offers some opportunities,'' said the American lawyer. `` It gets at an awful problem that they have. The deterioration in the standard of living of the Soviet people is becoming a greater and greater concern.''

 Opponents of cuts in education funds said a huge <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> demonstration showed the strength of their cause, and students volunteered to replace mums that were trampled when the rally turned unruly. About 15,000 state college and university students gathered at the Capitol Wednesday, but organizers lost control of the protest. Four people were arrested and two injured in the melee. `` The fact that so many people came out was extraordinary and sent a very clear message that they care about the quality of their education,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsongas </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION> in Higher Education, said Thursday. `` But, like I remember during my youth, the excesses of a handful always get more attention than what I believe was the remarkably good -LRB- behavior -RRB- of the vast, vast majority.''

But she said she would n't hold the `` ill-behaved and outrageous'' minority against the students' cause. The higher education budget, already strapped by earlier cuts, is set to be stripped of $ 25 million more during the next round of budget reductions. The protesters were calling for the programmed cuts to be restored.

<TEXT>
 Many priests are called upon at the hour of death, but the Rev. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> may be the only priest with his finger on the button of the bombs that could one day obliterate mankind. As a nuclear test controller at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site, his job is to safely detonate the most powerful and horrifying weapons. As an ordained Episcopal priest, he prays those weapons will never be used. Actually, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> says, it is n't buttons that set off the bombs. `` It's all done by computers now,'' he explained in a recent interview. But with priests generally among the protesters at the underground test site where he works, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> says he is forced daily to reconcile the differences between his occupation and his calling. He admits to being `` the only priest I know who fires nuclear weapons.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a 48-year-old father of two children, became a priest two years ago and, as he explains it, almost against his will. `` With my family, work and other commitments, I thought becoming a priest was something that just could n't happen,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. But he finally heeded a bishop's advice that a true calling would not go away. `` The way God works, he just does n't follow the rules at all,'' he said. As deputy manager of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and one of three rotating controllers at the test site, he has given the final authority for the detonation of more than 30 underground nuclear tests in the 1980s. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> often is asked to go before anti-nuclear groups and explain the government's position that nuclear testing is vital to the nation's security. `` I do n't think in any of these discussions I change anybody's mind or they change mine, but we come away from honest and direct discussions the better for it,'' he said `` The best comment I ever got from one anti-nuclear activist was ` I do n't agree with what you're doing, but I'm glad you're the one doing it.''' He added that he would like to be in a situation where there are no nuclear weapons. `` But I would also like a situation where we maintain the system of freedom and justice we have in our country,'' he said. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a lifelong <PERSON> Episcopalian </PERSON>, was nominated into the priesthood by the congregation at <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> under a church canon that allows the elevation of parishioners to priests in remote parishes. `` Bob is just an exceptional priest and a very humble person,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zabriskie </PERSON>, the church's <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> bishop. `` I wish I had more like him.'' <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquilina </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s boss and the manager of the sprawling nuclear testing facility northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s honesty had gained him the respect of co-workers as well as that of protesters on the other side of the fence `` He's the kind of guy I admire and respect whether he worked for me or was on the other side,'' <PERSON> Aquilina </PERSON> said. `` I believe he comes across in a very credible way because he's so honest. I've never second-guessed his motives on anything. <PERSON> Zabriskie </PERSON>, who said the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has taken no firm stand on nuclear testing, views <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> as a `` bridge builder'' who is able to communicate with both sides on an emotional issue. `` I think he's a peacemaker; I really do,'' <PERSON> Zabriskie </PERSON> said. `` He takes a lot of risks and is very vulnerable when he stands up before the hostility of some people.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> does not criticize anti-nuclear protesters who often congregate at the gates of the test site. Many are his friends, including the wife of another Episcopal priest in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and the priest's wife are founding board members and work closely together on a project to build a shelter for homeless women and children. `` We just do n't talk about nuclear weapons when we're working together,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` She and I have the same ultimate aim. We'd both like not to have nuclear weapons. The difference is how we get there.''

<TEXT>
 The states in the center of the country are falling behind the rest of the nation in the rate of nonfarm personal income growth, the government says. `` In the Plains region, nonfarm income grew 6.9 percent ... 1.5 percentage points below the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> average,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. `` Durable manufacturing payrolls grew slower than in any other region. `` Construction and nondurable manufacturing also were weak,'' according to the report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION>. `` In each <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> state _ <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> _ nonfarm income grew slower than the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. average.'' States in the interior regions generally continued to lag behind both coasts in income growth. The interior regions averaged a 7.5 percent rate, while the coastal regions averaged 8.9 percent. Besides the Plains, the growth rate in other interior regions was 7.5 percent in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> states; 7.7 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, and 7.9 percent in the Great Lakes. The average growth for the country was 8.4 percent, the department said. The inflation rate for the 12 months ending in June was 5.2 percent. The Far West led the coastal growth, up 9.6 percent, bolstered by strength in construction and manufacturing, particularly aircraft production. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is headquartered in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and the <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The Far West also includes <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and the national income growth leader, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. In each of the other coastal regions, however, growth was only somewhat above the national average _ up 8.7 percent in the Southeast, 8.6 percent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and 8.5 in the <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, with its tourism and mining industries, continued to lead the country in income growth, up 12.8 percent. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> ranked last with a 3.6 percent growth rate. Following <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> in income growth were: <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, 10.9 percent; <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, 10.5 percent; <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, 10.4 percent; <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, 10.3 percent; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, 10.1 percent; <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, 10 percent; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 9.9 percent; <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, 9.7 percent; and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, 9.6 percent.

<HEAD>Michigan Begins Paying Private Insurance for Some AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA ZAGAROLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Needy AIDS sufferers too ill to continue working are finding a reprieve in a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> program that offers to pay their private insurance premiums in order to save the state millions of Medicaid dollars. The program is a model for similar programs being developed in other states, including <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said state Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollister </PERSON>, who developed the idea. Nine men with acquired immune deficiency syndrome have qualified for the two-year pilot program, which was implemented Oct. 1 in the metropolitan <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> counties of <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION>, where the bulk of the state's AIDS patients live. Assistance is offered to AIDS patients who had a job but were forced to stop working because of illness. Federal regulations allow people who lose their jobs to keep their insurance for up to 18 months at their own expense, but many can not afford it. Instead of waiting for the patient's inevitable fall to Medicaid status, the state can intervene at that point and pay the private insurance premium, saving more than $ 1,000 per month per person, officials said. The cost of treating an AIDS patient in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is about $ 1,600 a month. The average payment for the nine people who have qualified is $ 245 a month, said program coordinator <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. The program could save <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> $ 4 million by 1991, said <PERSON> Hollister </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>. And it's helping AIDS patients who would hover near the poverty level, said <ORGANIZATION> Wellness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Networks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Executive Director <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, whose organization operates <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s AIDS-information hot line `` Financially, AIDS is a very devastating disease that can just wipe people out, just the medication costs alone,'' she said. To qualify for the program, a person must have an income less than $ 1,000 per month, and cash assets of less than $ 10,000. A physician must certify that the person's medical condition makes it unlikely he can continue working. The insurance industry has been cooperative, and in three cases companies bent the rules and allowed the state to resume payment of a policy that had been cut off, said <PERSON> Hollister </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> plans to promote its program through radio commercials and advertisements in underground newspapers and gay magazines, as well as through hospitals and AIDS advocacy groups, said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. As of Oct. 1, 1,337 cases of AIDS had been reported in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> since 1981, 791 of whom died. During the same period nationally, 109,167 cases were reported and 63,836 died.

<HEAD>House Votes to Double Aid Package to Warsaw Pact Reformers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is turning up the political heat on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with its overwhelming approval of $ 837 million in aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> over the next three years, nearly double what the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> asked. `` The administration has failed to grasp that this is a critical turning point in the history of East-West relations,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., a member of the Democratic leadership The aid, approved Thursday on a 345-47 vote, is an effort to shore up fledgling reform movements in the two <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> countries and seize political advantage on the issue from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose response has been branded `` timid'' by congressional Democrats. House Republicans joined the march in droves. `` The winds of freedom and democracy are sweeping across <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and are tearing holes in the Iron Curtain,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., adding the aid package was essential to sustain the reforms Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, called it `` an extraordinarily cheap way of helping redirect the course of history.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initially proposed $ 149 million for the two countries when he visited <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in July, but since then has raised the amount to $ 450 million under pressure from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. But the measure that passed the House Thursday clearly has made the administration uncomfortable. It wants to retain leverage to make sure economic reforms go forward, but does n't want to be seen as reluctant to reward those who are breaking the grip of communism. In a statement, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said it would generally support the bill but `` has reservations about the excessive funding levels'' and would work to decrease the amount when the bill goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Included in the package were a $ 200 million grant to help stabilize <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economy; $ 160 million for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and $ 40 million for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to promote private enterprise; $ 200 million in short-term guarantees and insurance for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters selling products to the two countries; and up to $ 125 million in food aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The debate over food aid took up much of the debate time, with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members arguing over whether to trim an estimated $ 37 million subsidy in the bill for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> maritime interests. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 228-170 not to cut the requirement that 75 percent of the food be shipped on more expensive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessels. Other money would provide technical training in business skills, environmental improvements, aid to democratic institutions, cultural exchanges, scientific projects and medical aid. In their first open voting in 40 years, Poles last June handed control of the government to leaders of the Solidarity trade union. A week ago the new government outlined plans for sweeping economic reforms. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> this year became the first <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nation to physically dismantle the barriers at its borders and allow East Germans to flee to the West. It is developing a new multi-party political system under a liberalized constitution and plans parliamentary elections early next year. But economic problems in both countries threaten the reforms. The Polish government faces particularly crucial tests, with inflation running at an annual rate of 200 percent and climbing, food shortages, and a $ 39 billion foreign debt burden. Supporters of the aid package said it will help relieve economic pressures and buy time for the new leaders to institutionalize their reforms, while encouraging changes in the rest of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Citizens in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are watching what is happening in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, said Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` If these experiments fail, it will stifle the prospects for political and economic reform in the other countries,'' he said.

 Environmentalists who failed to stop a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee from approving <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>'s nomination to a top natural resources post will take their fight against him to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. `` We are disappointed we did n't win the committee vote,'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of the <PERSON> SierraClub </PERSON> said after the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s 12-7 vote Thursday in favor of <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> `` But we think it was close enough to set up a tight struggle on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor and we are going to go all out.'' `` Once the senators hear in depth about this man's record they are going to be concerned,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., urged a vote against <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>, saying his record in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> showed an `` unwillingness to protect the environment. But committee Republicans, joined by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sens </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, voted to send the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cason </ORGANIZATION>'s nomination to be assistant secretary of agriculture for natural resources. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said, however, they might vote against <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> after the floor debate. Sen. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, argued against <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>'s confirmation and said he might try to block a full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote unless he is convinced <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> can be trusted to protect the public over private interests. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>'s decision at <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 to sell federal land at `` fire sale prices'' of $ 2.50 an acre. He said the government made $ 17,000 on the sale to private interests who weeks later resold it for $ 37 million. `` When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was considering legislation stopping those transactions, Mr. <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and urged investors to file claims before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acted,'' <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> cut back on audits of companies buying oil from wells on public and Indian land. He said the change in procedures cost the government and the tribes `` tens, perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars.'' Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the committee, said his earlier reservations about <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> were answered when Secretary of Agriculture <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> assured him <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> would take orders from <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. The committee unanimously approved <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s nomination earlier this year and has supported his work at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> also said he believed <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> had become much more sensitive to environmental concerns during the committee's confirmation hearings. <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> appeared before the committee for two days as senators questioned him about decisions favoring private interests he made while at Interior during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. After the hearings, <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to withdraw the nomination. Among other problems, <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said evidence showed <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> suppressed a report in 1986 that warned of irreversible environmental damage, including survival of the spotted owl, if logging was allowed in certain areas of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> said he withheld the report because he wanted more information. <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>, who has held various high posts at Interior since the early 1980s, would be in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, if confirmed.

<HEAD>Defaults in Supplemental Student Loans Jump 1,664 percent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government audit shows defaults on loans from a new federal student financial aid program skyrocketed by 1,664 percent in three years, and defaults are getting just as bad with borrowers from trade schools. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> found loan defaults in the Supplemental Loans to Students -LRB- SLS -RRB- programs increased from $ 14 million in fiscal year 1987 to $ 40 million in 1988, and to $ 247 million in 1989. The amount of SLS loans doubled in that time, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said in a report released Thursday. `` Students attending proprietary -LRB- profit-making -RRB- schools generally have higher default rates. These figures are not dissimilar to what we have seen with the other student aid programs,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON>, director of education and employment for the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. Gainer said more than $ 3.2 billion in the Supplemental Loans to Students -LRB- SLS -RRB- program have been guaranteed by nine lenders _ mainly banks, credit unions and savings and loan associations _ in the last three years. Students defaulted on $ 310.6 million during that period, the nine agencies reported. The SLS program, enacted in 1986, provides market-rate loans. Higher education students are eligible for an SLS loan, after first meeting more stringent eligibility requirements of other government-guaranteed loans, such as <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> grants and <LOCATION> Stafford </LOCATION> loans, formerly called guaranteed student loans. Although the main purpose of the loan is to supplement other aid, <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON> said the audit found 419,434 student borrowers received only SLS loans during the three years compared to 673,458 who received both SLS and <LOCATION> Stafford </LOCATION> loans. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont., requested the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> Under the SLS program, graduate students and those undergraduates responsible for their own financial support are allowed to borrow up to $ 4,000 per year, to a maximum of $ 20,000. Unlike the Stafford loans and <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> grants, eligibility is not based on a borrowers' financial resources. SLS loans have variable interest rates, adjusted annually according to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> borrowing rates. Repayment must generally begin within 60 days of the last loan disbursement for each year a loan is received. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the loan volume increased from $ 564 million in the 1987 fiscal year to $ 1.347 billion in the 1988 fiscal year, and dropped slightly to $ 1.294 billion in 1989. The amount of loans to proprietary or trade school borrowers increased from 55 percent to about 60 percent from the 1987 to 1989 fiscal years, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> found. At the same time, the amount of loans to freshmen borrowers increased from 40 percent of <ORGANIZATION> SLS </ORGANIZATION> loans 1987 to about 63 percent in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Loan defaults from freshmen increased from 12 percent of all defaults in 1987 to 85 percent in 1989. Similarly, defaults from proprietary school borrowers increased from 12 percent of SLS loan defaults in 1987 to 86 percent in 1989.

 The 32-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> freeway reduced to dust and debris by this week's earthquake had a history of minor problems, including some that were n't fixed promptly, according to state inspection reports. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports, made available Thursday, include one from 1966 describing a sagging road deck that made it difficult for drivers to control cars. A 1961 report talked of `` above-average cracks'' in several deck sections and a 1980 report suggested about $ 455,000 worth of repairs such as resealing joints and replacing expansion beams. The work was n't immediately done and was suggested again in a 1983 report. Other problems ranged from hairline cracks and clogged drains to auto damage to rails, flaking concrete, bent spans and a cracked girder. `` -LRB- But -RRB- there was no problem of structural failure at all,'' state <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said of the reports. Best also said engineers delayed strengthening the section of freeway because they believed it would survive a major quake. `` We did n't know 10 years ago this was subject to this type of earthquake damage. We did not know there was any possibility it would collapse,'' he said. <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said he was unaware of a private engineer's report from 1975 saying that the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed had an outdated design that made it vulnerable to such quakes. `` I've been assured there were no experts, no studies, no data that suggested in any way that it would fall,'' <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said. A 1 \ - mile-long stretch of the two-tiered interstate, also called the <ORGANIZATION> Nimitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeway </ORGANIZATION>, collapsed in Tuesday An upper section of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> also collapsed. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> has called for an immediate investigation of I-880's collapse. A commission of bridge engineers is being set up to determine why the structure fell and what can be done to prevent such tragedies, <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> said. Engineer <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said he determined in his 1975 study that the structure would n't survive a major earthquake. And he said the information was presented to state transportation officials at that time. <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> said it is irresponsible to suggest the state knew the structure would collapse. He said it's possible there were `` unusual subsurface conditions that we did n't know about'' that could have contributed to the collapse. The highway was built on fill dirt. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> blamed the collapse on wood-fiber expansion joints on the columns that held up the highway, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Asked why the late designer of the highway, F.W. Panhorst, used the joints, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said: `` God only knows. ... It creates a tremendous weakness position for the columns.'' The failed structure had undergone only the first phase of a three-step program to reinforce <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s roadways. Work on I-880 began in 1977 and was the first improvement since the highway was designed in 1954 and constructed in 1957. But the work on I-880 and other roads with double-column supports was deferred while officials focused on phase two, shoring up single-column elevated roadways. The third phase, now under way, calls for research with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> to figure out how to strengthen multiple-column supports of multi-level elevated highways. Officials maintained that I-880 was not neglected or given too low a priority in the project. However, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kariotis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> structural engineer who studies earthquakes, said the state could have `` colossally reduced'' the danger by sheathing the columns in steel jackets, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>.

The government's only witness, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Special Agent <PERSON> Lizzie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON>, testified about conversations she had with <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> starting Oct. 4. in which he told her about passing information, later determined by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to be classified, to the Soviets Ms. <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> came to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, accompanied by an official from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, to tell his story. According to the agent, <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> left his wife and two children near <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, last June. Leaving behind a note Ms. <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> said read, `` Do n't look for me, I'm gone,'' <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> began an odyssey that took him from Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and back to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> told her he met by happenstance a Soviet official, <PERSON> Feodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Temoyev </PERSON>, during his travels in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. The Soviet made arrangements for a trip for <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` He stated to me he had defected,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> told the court. She said <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> gave classified communications intelligence information to the Soviets during his 10-day stay in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and also provided Soviet agents with diagrams and charts. English said his client believed the information he passed on was unclassified and argued there was no intent to harm the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. He said <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> also had broached the idea of working as a double agent when he voluntarily went to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> served from 1963 to 1966 in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s Electronic Security Command in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and from 1969 to 1979 in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, where he dealt with classified communication-gathering. He also worked at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> from 1983 to 1984. He had top secret code word clearance in all his jobs. Ms. <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> told her he was paid $ 2,000 for the information he provided to the Soviets and would receive up to $ 100,000 if he would return to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> plant and obtain other secrets. She said <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> agreed. <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> faces a minimum sentence of 30 years in prison and a maximum of a life sentence if convicted.

 Some legislative leaders have proposed special taxes to pay for earthquake damage, and Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said he may support a new levy. `` If we do n't have enough -LRB- money -RRB- in terms of what we have on hand, I have not ruled out the possibility of a tax increase to raise whatever funds necessary to bring the communities back to normal,'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> told reporters Thursday while touring badly damaged <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. The state has an emergency reserve fund of just over $ 1 billion that can be spent without legislative approval. Tuesday's earthquake has caused well over $ 4 billion in damage, according to the state. Some private economists say it may reach $ 10 billion. Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, has said he would prefer a short-term increase in the gasoline or sales tax to pay for quake repairs. `` I do n't really think we should be relying on the budget reserve to rebuild the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> or the freeway,'' he said of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> met Thursday with 17 Bay area-legislators, some of whom had their own ideas about how to raise earthquake repair money. Assemblyman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> said there should be a one-year, 25-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax surcharge to raise $ 3.5 billion to help repair the damage and to strengthen bridges, overpasses and elevated highways statewide. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, a Republican, was scheduled to meet legislative leaders _ including <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> _ on Monday. The governor said there is precedent for a special tax. He said motor fuel taxes have at times been raised to pay for roads damaged in natural disasters. He said a special legislative session _ which only he could call _ would be required. The 17 legislators who met Thursday with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> agreed unanimously to a special session and said transportation and housing needs should be the top priorities. The lawmakers ended their regular 1989 session in September and are not due to return until January.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is considering how to respond if the Kremlin cracks down on freedom movements in the Baltic republics or if those states gain independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, says a senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has never recognized <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> annexation of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, which were occupied by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> during World War II, and that policy has come under new scrutiny with the upsurge of independence movements there. `` Our basic policy of non-recognition has not changed and it is not going to change,'' Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON> testified Thursday before the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Peace and Security in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Activists in the Baltic republics, encouraged by the reforms of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, have been campaigning for more independence, but have drawn sharp warnings from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> officials. `` We are going to have to develop well-considered administration responses to this,'' <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON> said. `` Many of us who have not been experts on the Baltic republics are becoming Baltic experts.'' Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> assured Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> at their meeting in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> last month that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would not use force against the Baltic independence movements. However, a private attorney told the congressional panel on Thursday the approach by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other Western governments was too timid and disorganized to ensure a peaceful solution. `` Western statesmen have reacted to the resurgence of peaceful, democratic, Baltic mass movements with nervous confusion and anxiety,'' testified <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney. `` Not one Western state, to my knowledge, has ever proposed a plan for independence for the Baltic states or proposed a peaceful diplomatic solution for the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> region that would take into account the security interests of nation's of <LOCATION> East-Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including the U.S.S.R,'' said <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arvydas </PERSON> <PERSON> Juozaitis </PERSON>, a leader of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> popular front, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> recently that his movement expects to win a 80 percent majority in elections scheduled for next February in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, one of 15 Soviet republics. One of the first acts of the Lithuanian parliament will be to dissolve itself and vote to form a new government, independent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Juozaitis </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> would then seek to establish ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the basis of a 1939 treaty which affirms Lithuanian independence but allows the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to maintain military bases in the republic. `` To achieve some agreement with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, we will agree that Soviet troops can remain in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Juozaitis </PERSON> said. Asked whether there was any flexibility in the <LOCATION> Sajudis </LOCATION> position, <PERSON> Juozaitis </PERSON> said: `` I suppose. A lot of maneuvering can occur in the nearest future, before the Lithuanian Soviet sits.'' `` We are not expecting that the Soviets would use force before a radical decision is taken. They have no argument for using force before a decision is taken,'' he said. `` One of our most decisive tasks is to win time. If we win a month, we are happy because there are big changes every month,'' he said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration favors democratic elections to `` allow the Baltic peoples do decide these questions themselves,'' <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON> told the congressional panel headed by Rep. <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, D-Md. `` We, the administration and other governments, have to consider how we can best promote that process,'' he said. `` We are prepared to respect and enthusiastically support whatever the results of the process of self-determination are.'' The congressional panel underscored <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for Baltic independence by hearing testimony from the heads of the Estonian, <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> and Lithuanian legations, who represent their governments in exile. It was the first time in 35 years the emigre missions had testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the legation heads, <PERSON> Stasys </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozoraitis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anatol </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinbergs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaakson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>.

 Lessons learned in a 1983 <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> bridge disaster could provide a blueprint for engineers seeking to rebuild a collapsed section of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, officials say. The engineers who designed a temporary span on the <LOCATION> Mianus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bridge on Interstate 95 are suddenly in demand, as are hundreds of structural engineers around the country who could reap a windfall from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake. <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> <PERSON> Zawodiak </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> had asked for the names of contractors and equipment used in the reconstruction of the <LOCATION> Mianus </LOCATION> bridge. A three-lane section of southbound I-95 collapsed on June 28, 1983, killing three people. The accident was blamed on a failed hanger system that supported the bridge's steel girders. The highway is a major transportation link between <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and is used daily by thousands of commuters. A two-lane, temporary span once described as `` a giant Erector set'' was built over the gaping hole in the interstate in 22 days. On July 22, 1983, the temporary span was opened to light traffic. While the temporary bridge was in place, crews worked below to construct three new, permanent lanes. It was the first time such a procedure was used to rebuild a bridge. The reconstructed bridge was opened to traffic in January 1984. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a 50-foot, five-lane section of the upper deck of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> collapsed onto the lower deck during Tuesday's earthquake The collapse has closed a vital link for those commuting between <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zawodniak </PERSON> said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> transportation officials could construct a temporary span similar to the one used on the Mianus bridge. However, because the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> has two levels, he said, he was n't sure if construction could take place while the temporary span was in place. The earthquake, which also caused the collapse of a 1 \ - mile stretch of Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, has drawn hundreds of structural engineers to The engineers _ most of whom are government employees, but some of whom are private contractors _ are crawling around buildings, elevators, dams, highways, bridges, pipelines and other structures that might have suffered damage. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Killeen </PERSON>, vice president of engineering for <ORGANIZATION> Acrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which built the temporary <LOCATION> Mianus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> span, said his company has contacted <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> transportation officials. But he declined to say whether his company might become involved in reparing the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. `` We're sharing ideas with the state,'' <PERSON> Killeen </PERSON> said. Acrow's bridges use a series of 10-by-5-foot panels connected in rows to form trusses. Beams are placed between them to form a bridge deck. In addition to <LOCATION> Mianus </LOCATION>, the technology was used to erect temporary bridges in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state in the wake of the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helen </LOCATION>'s volcano in 1980. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Shugert </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the corps solicited information about <LOCATION> Mianus </LOCATION> as a courtesy to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials. Corps engineers said they did n't know if the Mianus technology would be applied to the Bay bridge `` We were looking for anything that would help them,'' <PERSON> Shugert </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Government Solar Experts Report Major Solar Flare, Warn Of Magnetic

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A major magnetic storm unleashed by a giant solar flare is forecast to surge about the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> today, possibly causing power surges, radio blackouts and shimmering lights near the poles. Sun watchers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the flare erupted on the sun Thursday morning and almost immediately saturated instruments aboard a <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> satellite with X-rays. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a geophysical forecaster at the Space Environment Services Center run by <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said he was sending alerts to electrical utilities in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and in the northern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to expect possible power surges today when a powerful magnetic storm is expected to arrive at the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Radiation from strong solar flares can affect satellites and spacecraft, but officials at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday they evaluated the burst of energy and determined astronauts on board the orbiting space shuttle Atlantis are not in danger. `` In the orbit we're in, at 160 miles altitude, it is no threat at all,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittemore </PERSON>, a flight director at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` We're not concerned at all.'' A <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>, the probe released from Atlantis six hours after the space shuttle was launched Wednesday, was built to resist radiation much stronger than solar flares and will not be affected. <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> is almost a quarter-million miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on its six-year journey to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the solar flare generated such a strong burst of X-rays that instruments on <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>'s GOES satellite were overwhelmed. The satellite detects the radiation up to X-12, a term used to measure X-ray flux. The flare was estimated to be an X-13. The flare also produced a proton burst that <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said was about 1,000 times stronger than the flux of protons from a quiet sun. `` We measured 2,000 particles per cubic centimeter per second,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. `` A quiet sun will have 2 or 3 particles.'' Protons are energetic particles than can affect electronic equipment in high-flying satellites, particularly those orbiting the poles. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said a major geomagnetic storm should erupt today and continue for two days. Energy from such storms can knock out long-distance radio transmissions, disrupt land-line communications and cause power surges in unprotected power transmission wires, particularly in far northern and southern latitudes. A similar storm in March caused some blackouts in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` Radio communications over the poles will be wiped out'' during the storm, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> forecast. He said an alert was being sent to the Canadian government. The flare occurred as solar activity is rising toward the top of its current 11-year cycle, which began in 1986. A flare of similar strength was recorded in August. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the flare erupted from a group of sunspots near the center of the solar disc as viewed from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. It will take about a week for the sunspot group to move out of view from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and it could produce more major flares. `` That would not be surprising,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. Solar flares may also produce an aurora, the spectacular display of shimmering colors over the poles known in the northern hemisphere as the northern lights. Solar storms earlier this year created a northern light display visible as far south as <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 There is a sense of triumph amid the death and destruction of the earthquake that struck <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Skyscrapers shook but did n't fall. Trains stopped but most were running again within hours. Businesses closed for a day to assess damage, then reopened. The Bay Bridge was crippled, so thousands of commuters switched to ferries. Police and fire officials maintained order. Hospitals stayed open with auxiliary power. Radio and television kept up a critical flow of information to the public. Perhaps most important, though, the vast majority of people did n't panic. Instead, they comforted and helped each other, taking in neighbors and strangers. The quake created heroes, from a surgeon who rescued a child trapped on the collapsed Interstate 880 freeway to the thousands who worked round the clock coping with the crisis. `` If this was a test of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area's ability to respond to a major earthquake, we got an ` A,''' says <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Economy. `` There are more than 6 million people in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area and a couple of hundred people died,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said Thursday, two days after the quake. `` It's horrible for the families of victims and traumatic for everyone, but it's not in the realm of a regional economic disaster.'' Certainly, there were failures and lessons to be learned. Commuters trapped in a <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> train beneath the bay when power went out complained they were n't given enough information by <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> officials about the quake. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was understaffed and stretched to the limit in fighting blazes. Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said he was `` ticked off'' that Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> failed to consult with him during a tour of city. And questions continue about why I-880 crumbled and why a section of the Bay Bridge fell like a trap door. Seen from a helicopter, though, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> remain remarkably intact. The towers of steel, concrete and glass in both cities stand tall in defiance of a jolt that sent shock waves 750 miles up and down the coast and eastward through the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. `` It speaks a lot for the design code of modern buildings and the preparedness of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that there was n't more damage,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, acting director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. The skyscrapers were unharmed, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said, because they were `` overdesigned'' to prevent sway in upper levels and to resist powerful wind gusts as much as earthquakes. `` I think we're going to learn a lot from this event,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` Many of the buildings have instruments that can determine stresses and strains. We know the original designs of these buildings and we know the ground motion and amplitude. Adding these together will give us a very good picture where the weak links are and that will improve designs for the future.'' Most small buildings and homes throughout the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area also survived with little or no damage, unlike those that crumbled in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> when a similar 6.9 magnitude quake struck last December and left 25,000 people dead and tens of thousands homeless. The economic toll of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quake is already estimated at $ 4 billion and, according to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, a top economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, is likely to reach $ 10 billion. But that represents only about a month's worth of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area's $ 125 billion annual economy, he said, and will be offset quickly by a boost to the economy from reconstruction jobs, insurance payments and federal assistance. Within a day of the quake, trucks were moving in and out of the Port of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, which handles 1,700 vessels a month. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> continued to process cash, checks and wire transfers `` without a glitch,'' according to a spokesman. Most large banks used emergency generators to keep their computers operating. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> international airports resumed operations Wednesday. <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>'s was shut down for only three hours Tuesday night. The ultimate triumphs, though, were personal. <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Jann </PERSON>, a station agent for <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION>, worked 18 hours day from Tuesday afternoon until Wednesday morning to help people. `` We worked the whole night just to make sure people could get back across the bay, and we stayed with them to make them feel they were n't alone in this,'' he said. Among those he aided were three women _ one black, one white, one <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> _ who were stuck in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jann </PERSON> and his co-workers watched over the women as they huddled together in the <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> station until 1 a.m., then drove them to the ferry and arranged to have their husbands meet them in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. `` Race, origin, what they did for a living, nothing mattered,'' he said. `` These three ladies banded together. That was typical of how everybody acted. The whole Bay area banded together and survived.''

<HEAD>Number of Cases of Skin Cancer Leveling Off After Sharp Rise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After decades of soaring rates of skin cancer _ largely because of suntanning _ Americans finally may be wising up to the dangers of the bronzed look, a medical researcher says. Rates of malignant melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, appeared to start leveling off in 1988, after 27 years of steep rises, said Dr. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanente </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` It's going to take some more time to follow that along,'' Glass said in a telephone interview Thursday. But early figures from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, appear to indicate a similar leveling off, he said. Glass' remarks came after he reported on a long-term tracking of 300,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanente </ORGANIZATION> prepaid health plan in the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, areas. Researchers found that from 1960 to 1987, annual cases of a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma increased 2.6 times in men and 3.1 times in women. Squamous cell carcinoma is one of the commonest skin cancers, occurring in thousands of people each year. Usually starting as a scaly patch on the lip, ear or hand, it grows, spreads and even causes death if untreated. `` Squamous cell skin cancer clearly seems to be related to skin exposure _ it is more common among fair-skinned individuals, especially those with frequent or long-term exposure to sunlight,'' said a report by Glass and Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Their findings represent the first systematic report over time of squamous cell skin cancer, they said. The researchers also looked at melanoma, and found its incidence rose 3.5-fold and 4.6-fold among men and women, respectively, during the same 27-year period. Greater exposure to sunlight is only one of many factors believed to have contributed to the increased rates of melanoma, the researchers said in their report in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But the occurrence of melanomas on the body's trunk rose much faster than cancers involving the head and neck or the extremities, the researchers said. `` These observations are consistent with the impression that the rising incidence of both malignancies may be attributable to increased voluntary exposure to the sun,'' said the researchers. Malignant melanoma, which often starts in an existing mole that becomes enlarged, is the kind of cancer most likely to spread and kill. Researchers found 2,453 cases of invasive skin cancers among members of the health plan. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that half of all people who live to age 65 will have skin cancer at some point in their lives and predicted malignant melanoma will kill 6,000 people this year. `` As individuals and as a society, it is only prudent to take precautions to save our skins,'' said an editorial in the journal by Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstock </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, R.I. He called for preservation of the earth's ozone layer, which blocks harmful ultraviolet radiation, and early detection and treatment of skin cancers, as well as increased public awareness and use of sunscreens.

<HEAD>New Cell Culture Technique Holds Promise for Burn Patients</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Skin Cancer, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors cultivating healthy skin in a bed of cow protein say the new cell culture technique may allow severely burned patients to `` grow'' stronger and more resilient skin. The new technique has the potential of helping thousands of severely burned patients, said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansbrough </PERSON>, director of the burn center at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` When we put this on the patient and it takes and grows,'' <PERSON> Hansbrough </PERSON> said, `` there are certain structural proteins formed that anchor the skin to the body ... very early, and that's the real breakthrough.'' <PERSON> Hansbrough </PERSON> and his colleagues, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and Dr. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> UCSD </ORGANIZATION>, published their findings in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The researchers said they cultivated areas of skin several times the size of the palm of the hand. They reported on results in four patients who had successful grafts on burns covering from 43 percent to 74 percent of their bodies. The new technique shows evidence of allowing a graft to anchor to the body within nine days, compared with the `` four weeks to six months to a year'' for cultured human skin cells alone to attach fully to the body, <PERSON> Hansbrough </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Thursday. The grafts produced by the new technique also appear to be stronger and more resilient. At present, many fragile grafts from cultured skin cells are lost in the laboratory, the researchers said. The new technique will take three to five years to develop for general use, the researchers said. It promises to save patients who die because doctors are unable to harvest enough healthy skin from them before they succumb to infections, <PERSON> Hansbrough </PERSON> said. It could also save on medical costs by greatly reducing the amount of time patients need to spend in intensive care, he said. At $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 a day for intensive care, `` if we could eliminate even one month of hospitalization, that would be $ 100,000,'' he said. An editorial accompanying the study acknowledged the new skin-grafting technique's apparent advantages of rapid anchoring to the body and easier handling in the laboratory. Unanswered questions about the new technique include whether it promotes faster development of circulation in the graft than those in current use, and whether the technique will work as well on large areas of skin as it does on the small ones used in the study. The researchers used a latticework of cow or ox collagen, a protein that is one of the main building materials in animal tissues, and laced it with human cells of fibroblast, connective tissue that gives skin its resilience. They then placed a layer of outer skin cells on top and cultivated the graft in the laboratory. Animal collagen was used because it is readily available and is virtually identical at the cell level to human collagen, <PERSON> Hansbrough </PERSON> said.

 For <PERSON> Goldie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON>, the earthquake was like an intruder who robbed her of her most precious worldly possession: the place where she and her family lived. `` It was like somebody took everything I had and threw me out in the streets,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON>, 47, lying on a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> cot and keeping a watchful eye on two grandchildren at an emergency shelter. `` At least we have a roof over our heads and food to eat. You can always start over.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON> said. `` The unexpected can happen to anybody, rich or poor.'' The woman, her three children and two grandchildren were unable to stay in their city apartment because the earthquake split open walls and caused other damage. She stayed with a friend for two nights before checking into the shelter set up at the Moscone Convention Center. In the city, 2,555 people are staying in three <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelters. Ten thousand people were left homeless in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, according to the state Office of Emergency Preparedness. Most are staying with relatives or in hotels instead of in shelters. Life for the newly homeless consists of bare essentials: donated meals, bottled water, restrooms, a cot and a blanket or sleeping bag. Among the few frills were puppet shows for the kids, donated stuffed animals, chalkboards, jigsaw puzzles, playing cards and an occasional television. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> dispensed toothbrushes and other toiletries. The Moscone Center was supposed to have greeted delegates of the <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> before Tuesday's quake hit. Instead of exhibitors, about 90 families were housed in one hall. Other cots were crammed under escalators and in the crannies of the lobby. `` People still do n't feel safe outside. It's better to be here than to be alone,'' said shelter manager <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Puett </PERSON>. The shelter people were a motley bunch, thrown together by chance and circumstance. Those displaced by the quake bunked with the city's considerable homeless population who did n't have places to lose. As a way to beat the monotony, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Buell </PERSON> worked as a volunteer, helping people set up their cots, showing them locations of restrooms and offering a reassuring hand. `` Everything I have is gone. It's history. I'm still walking around in a daze,'' said <PERSON> Buell </PERSON>, 28, a professional boxer who escaped from his apartment in the <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district with the clothes on his back and $ 5 in his pocket. `` I'm stuck right now, so I might as well be helping people,'' <PERSON> Buell </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> offered snacks, juice, fruit and coffee. It also provided disposable diapers and baby food for fidgety infants such as 11-month-old <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, who was nursed by her mother, <PERSON> Terri </PERSON>. `` It seems like a nightmare,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, 29, whose apartment had a big crack in the ceiling and was uninhabitable. `` The first feeling was how it seemed like we were cut off from the rest of the world. I just feel so helpless.'' In the middle of the room, <PERSON> Blanca </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzanero </PERSON> entertained her three daughters with donated dolls and playthings. The woman drove into the city to see her lawyer and was trapped when a section of the Bay Bridge collapsed. She still has n't built up the nerve to try driving 30 milies home to <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>, where her husband is staying. `` I'm so afraid the freeway has a big hole in it. I want to wait until it's safe,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Manzanero </PERSON> said. `` It's better to stay here. It's the safest place for me.'' In the fashionable <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district, 500 families are bunking at the <ORGANIZATION> Marina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Reda </PERSON> tossed what they could into the back of their blue <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> station wagon and headed for the shelter. `` I just wanted to have my family albums. They're all my memories. You can rebuild a house,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Reda </PERSON>, who is five months pregnant.

<HEAD>House-Senate Negotiators Endorse Compensation for Japanese-Americans.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators have endorsed legislation guaranteeing $ 20,000 compensation payments to the estimated 60,000 living Japanese-Americans who were rounded up and sent to internment camps during World War II. The compromise legislation approved Thursday, which could pay the former internees as much as $ 1.2 billion over three years, must next be passed by both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before being sent to the White House for consideration by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has opposed the payments on grounds they are too costly. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not made his position known. The reparations payments are part of an overall $ 17.3 billion measure providing appropriations for the Commerce, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Justice departments for the 1990 fiscal year which opened Oct. 1. House negotiators accepted the Senate-passed version of the bill making the reparations payments an entitlement and guaranteeing that all of the still-living internees will receive them. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 74-22 on Sept. 29 to waive budget restrictions and guarantee the reparations payments are made. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the bill, which the conference approved, bars any payments until the beginning of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1, 1991. But it then makes up to $ 500 million a year available over three years until all of the $ 20,000 reparations payments are made.

<NOTE>Group Says Common Practices Not in Consumers' Interest</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A consumer group is charging that merchants across the country are handling personal checks and credit card transactions in ways that may lead to fraud and invasion of privacy. The organization, <ORGANIZATION> Bankcard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday assailed the practice of many merchants requiring customers who pay for purchases with personal checks to provide a major credit card number and expiration date, plus a telephone number. This information is then written on the check. `` Store clerks often pressure consumers into writing their bankcard numbers on personal checks, but these consumers do n't realize the potential danger in doing so,'' the group's director, <PERSON> Elgie </PERSON> <PERSON> Holstein </PERSON>, told a news conference He contended that `` mail order fraud and application fraud are increasingly popular crimes, and placing this information -LRB- a card's number and expiration date -RRB- on a personal check enables a thief to make purchases or apply for credit in the customer's name `` Requiring customers to present a major credit card as identification, or even noting on the check that the consumer holds a Visa or <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION>, can be an appropriate merchant practice,'' <PERSON> Holstein </PERSON> said. `` It is dangerous, however, to require credit card numbers to be written on checks.'' To help consumers deal with this practice, the organization is making available a wallet-sized `` Consumer Action Card'' to present to merchants who insist on writing credit card numbers on personal checks. The wallet card alerts merchants that recording this information encourages fraud and may violate a customer's privacy.

<TEXT>
 An environmental group says construction standards for nuclear power plants should be re-examined in the wake of the powerful <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area earthquake. There are five active nuclear power plants in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but all are in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says Tuesday's quake caused no damage to the nuclear reactors. But <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Bossong </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, said nationwide at least two nuclear plants are `` perilously close to known fault lines.'' He cited Diablo Canyon, which is southwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Hosgri </LOCATION> fault, and Millstone, near the point at which the <LOCATION> Honey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Char </LOCATION> fault lines intersect in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. `` Federal regulators should at least view -LRB- the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> -RRB- earthquake as a final warning that seismic standards and testing for all nuclear reactors as well as evacuation planning needs to be substantially upgraded before the next quake hits,'' said <PERSON> Bossong </PERSON>. The Energy Department also acknowledges its three active nuclear reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> weapons complex in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which make materials for nuclear warheads, need to undergo seismic upgrades, he said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the three nuclear reactors in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that were running at the time of the quake are still running normally. The five plants in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> are: two at Diablo Canyon and three at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Onofre </LOCATION>, five miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION>. One reactor at each site was shut down for normal refueling when the quake hit. Under the 1973 standards set by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, each nuclear power plant must be built to quake-resistance specifications that differ according to local seismic conditions. The standards for Diablo Canyon are the stiffest in the country, <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said. The risk of nuclear plant accidents from earthquakes was a major point of contention between the industry and environmentalists during the 1960s and early 1970s, when site planning was done for most of the 110 plants now operating in this country. The chief danger is that a quake would cause a crack in the piping that carries cooling water to the reactor core. A rapid loss of coolant could cause the fuel rods in the core to melt, possibly allowing radioactive material to escape into the atmosphere.

And, she warned, `` He'd better not.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said what she chose to some 1,350 members of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s elite at the 44th annual <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Memorial Dinner Thursday. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who joined a long line of prominent people who have addressed the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> charity, said she welcomed the chance `` to prove I'm more than just a pretty face.'' She began her speech by contradicting a published report that said she weighs 135-140 pounds. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> said the press never gets anything right,'' she said. `` I was born weighing 135 pounds.'' Pausing briefly, she turned to outgoing Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who was also on the dais, and handed him his own favorite line. `` How'm I doin', <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>?'' she asked. The guests paid $ 500 a plate to dine on filet mignon and chocolate hazelnut torte. Proceeds from the dinner, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocese </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, go to health-care causes. At last year's dinner, then Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his presidential opponent, Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, traded jokes just weeks before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the race for the White House. `` I loved ` The Bonfire of the Vanities,''' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told this year's glittering gathering, referring to <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'s satirical look at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> politics and race relations. `` But I never dreamed I'd get to address some of the characters in person,'' she added, to laughter and applause. Thursday night found the increasingly combative top contenders for City Hall, Democrat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, sitting two seats apart on the dais. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> also attended. Governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from 1923 to 1928, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in 1928 became the first Catholic to be nominated for president. The first memorial dinner was held in 1945, a year after his death. Keynote speakers have included the first Catholic elected president, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>; former presidents <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>; <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>; comedians <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A man seeking to become the nation's first elected black governor was sharply critical of his opponent for invoking the name of slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in a televised debate. Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a former state attorney general, twice referred to King Thursday in defending his commitment to affirmative action. `` What we want is a society that is open to everyone, regardless of color,'' said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who said he worked as a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> student to get <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION> restaurants to desegregate. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said he supported King's view that people should be judged on their character and not their skin color. But Democrat <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, the state's lieutenant governor, said it was `` almost despicable' that <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> linked himself to King. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> responded angrily that the late Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> cast a veto `` that you encouraged'' of a bill creating a state holiday to honor King. The hourlong debate was the candidates' final televised debate before the Nov. 7 election. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> focused on taxes during the debate. `` What I want to do is hold the line on taxes,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. `` As a Democrat, he can be expected to raise taxes.'' But <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said he has fought repeatedly to repeal the sales tax on food and non-prescription drugs as well as for the pension tax relief. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> also charged <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> with switching from anti-death penalty to a pro-capital punishment stand and with once supporting collective bargaining for public employees. The issue that dominated the first debate, abortion, hardly was mentioned by the candidates. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> made a reference in his closing remarks about not returning to government interference in the private lives of its citizens and at another point said <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> promised his anti-abortion supporters their views would be represented in appointments to state offices. The debate coincided with the release of a new poll showing <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> virtually in a dead heat. The <ORGANIZATION> Mason-Dixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> poll showed 45 percent for <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> to 43 percent for <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. The poll's margin of error was 3 -LCB- percentage points either way. Since the last Mason-Dixon poll on Sept. 20, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> has gained 8 points and <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has dropped 1 point. The current governor, Democrat <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, is barred by the state Constitution from seeking a second consecutive term.

<TEXT>
 Many people hoping to buy the <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> doll, based on the ghoulish character in `` Nightmare on Elm Street'' movies, may be able to purchase it only in their dreams. The Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> had urged a boycott of the doll, announced Thursday that the Matchbox toy company informed him it would not proceed with plans to market the doll. `` We feel that the decision by <PERSON> Matchbox </PERSON> is a very positive and socially responsible one, and we commend them for their decision,'' <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said in disclosing the toy company's action. Matchbox, better known for tiny toy cars, confirmed that it decided to drop its plans _ at least temporarily _ for marketing a doll version of the movie fiend who has blades for fingernails and kills his victims in their dreams. `` Matchbox will not advertise or promote the doll in any way,'' said a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Matchbox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- USA -RRB- Ltd. The doll, announced last month, had been expected to be a hot seller ahead of Halloween. But Matchbox has not decided on the doll's ultimate fate. `` As far as 1990 goes, I do n't think any decision has been made,'' said the spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said he was told by <PERSON> Matchbox </PERSON> that about 40,000 dolls already being shipped will not be halted. But orders for another 160,000 dolls will not be filled. The Matchbox spokeswoman could not confirm the figures, but said orders for the doll significantly exceed the number of dolls already assembled. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which has backed boycotts of TV programs it considers offensive, had called for a boycott of the <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> doll immediately after it was announced last month. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> had called the <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> doll `` a product of a sick mind.'' The <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>, Miss.-based group also had urged a boycott of stores that stocked the doll and a boycott of all other toys made by <PERSON> Matchbox </PERSON>.

 Three ministers called to testify against a man who confessed during a church service to robbing his uncle's store are claiming that requirement would violate their right to freedom of religion. `` We're not in the business of putting people in jail. We're in the business of repenting them,'' <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiles </PERSON>, one of the ministers at the <ORGANIZATION> Word </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deliverance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Monday refused to quash a subpoena for Mrs. <PERSON> Hiles </PERSON>, 50; her husband, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiles </PERSON>, 50; and <PERSON> Wilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Maconaughay </PERSON>, 54. They were subpoenaed to testify in the trial of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, who is charged with breaking and entering. <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> postponed the trial until Dec. 5 to give the ministers time to appeal. At an evening service during Christmas week last year, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> stood up before 45 members of the congregation and said he had broken into his uncle's store. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> was arrested in January and has been in jail since on $ 25,000 bail. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> allegedly stole $ 3,700 worth of material from <ORGANIZATION> Yost </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The ministers, whose church advocates the public confession of sins, said their jail ministry program has been hurt because inmates are afraid that what they say will be used against them. `` This will stop the function of our church,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hiles </PERSON> said. `` We might as well close the doors because people wo n't be able to be born again.'' `` I've heard many public confessions from all kinds of good people who have repented,'' her husband said. `` A lot of them could have been dragged into court, but they became good people again, valuable people.'' If convicted, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> could be sentenced to life in prison without parole under the state's repeat offender law because he has two previous convictions. In 1986, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> and two other inmates broke out of the <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION>, broke into a bar across the street and stole a keg of beer, which they carried back to their cells and had a party.

<TEXT>
 A study by black researchers into the plight of black Americans provides more insight and policy recommendations than a far more expensive report conducted mostly by whites, says a sponsor of the new study. `` Historically, blacks have been treated as objects of study, rather than as major participants in conducting a study,'' said <PERSON> Wornie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trotter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Many studies say black people are unemployed,'' he said. `` We looked at why they're unemployed.'' The study, a summary volume of which was released Thursday, was commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Trotter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and cost about $ 100,000. `` Race continues to matter,'' according to the report. `` Discrimination persists, although its forms have altered.'' The study, titled `` Assessment of the Status of African-Americans,'' was conducted by academics around the country in response to another, controversial study of blacks by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> released last summer that was conducted mostly by whites at a cost of $ 2 million. That study, called `` A Common Destiny: Blacks and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>,'' found that blacks made great strides in the last 50 years but were losing ground in such areas as economic and educational status. At the time the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> study was announced in 1984, some black scholars protested their omission from the study. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> acknowledged Thursday that the basic findings of the <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON> study did not differ greatly from the previous report. He said he believes some of the protests by black scholars may have contributed to the `` fairness'' of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> study. But he said the <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON> report questioned how society contributes to the status of blacks today. `` They talked about cultural poverty but we go even further to explain why there is such a problem and make policy recommendations,'' said <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. The Trotter report calls for more federal assistance to black students, strengthening black families and stimulating economic growth, expanding child care and other federal aid programs, bail reform, cultural sensitivity training for judges and others in the criminal justice system and recruiting more blacks for the health professions. The report found that racial discrimination impedes blacks' access to health care, higher education and jobs and is present in the criminal justice system Among the specific findings: _ During 1985 and 1986, life expectancy for blacks dropped, the first consecutive decline this century. The average life expectancy for blacks dropped to 69.4 years in 1986, while whites increased to an all-time high of 75 years. _ In 1984, the average black family had a net worth of $ 3,400, compared with $ 39,000 for a white family. _ Minority youths are imprisoned three to four times more than white youths and receive stiffer sentences.

 The physical aftershocks that followed <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s monster quake have n't let up, and authorities say the psychological shockwaves are just beginning. `` We are getting people who are starting to call in now with some of the things we expected to have follow this earthquake,'' Eve Myer, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suicide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotline </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. `` We're seeing the depression that sets in after the adrenalin dies down and when the television stories -LRB- about the quake -RRB- start to repeat themselves.'' The usual load of 200 calls a day is up at least 10 percent since the quake, <PERSON> Myer </PERSON> said. The `` first wave'' of callers, generally elderly people who felt particularly vulnerable, is giving way to a second group that seems exceptionally confused by overpowering feelings of sadness and gloom, she said. Many callers are reporting trouble sleeping, sensing the incredible fright caused by the temblor all over again, and they appear to be linking the earthquake to other traumatic events in their lives and intensifying their discomfort, she said. <PERSON> Myer </PERSON> said she understands how they feel. When she could n't find her husband immediately after Tuesday's earthquake, she felt tension and frustration She said she later realized she had unconsciously associated the events with her mother's unsuccessful search for her husband in <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` That old story bubbled up in my head and I did n't realize I was reliving a war I had never been in ... and that's happening to other people, too,'' she said. `` This will happen more and more. That's a fairly natural thing.'' That's one reason the city is sending special mental health teams to help some of the newly set-up homeless shelters. `` It's like the rug is pulled out from under you _ the firm stance you have in the world gets shaken,'' said psychologist <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Langley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Porter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It forces you to confront your own mortality: that you do n't live forever, that bad things happen to good people _ sometimes for no reason at all,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said Thursday Dr. <PERSON> Lenore </PERSON> <PERSON> Terr </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> psychiatrist, said area residents expect earthquakes, so it may not be as traumatizing as other disasters. But for those who are severely distressed, symptoms include jumpiness, irritability, nightmares, emotional numbness and detachment, recurrent images of disaster, difficulty concentrating and sleeping, and fear of entering buildings or double-deck freeways like the one in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> that collapsed. People who survived unscathed often display disbelief of surrounding destruction, followed by relief, then guilt that they lived while others died, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. For those who had relatives die or homes destroyed, `` questions arise like ` Why me? What did I do to deserve this?' `` There is no one to get angry at, and sometimes feelings of anger at having been victimized are put onto other innocent people.'' Children are vulnerable, too. Those younger than age 3 `` may be a little bit more anxious, a little more clingy. If their parents are upset, their children will be upset,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, director of child and adult psychiatry at <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Porter </LOCATION>. Some help has come from computer communication systems. Prodigy, a <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based venture of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had a system going less than four hours after Tuesday's quake, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ek </PERSON>, communications manager. It also put a psychologist on line Wednesday night `` to help these people deal with the trauma. We had one person who know some of the people involved in the <ORGANIZATION> Nimitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> situation who was pretty distraught,'' <PERSON> Ek </PERSON> said. By Thursday afternoon, 1,530 messages were posted. <ORGANIZATION> CompuServe </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, based computer information service, with 550,000 individual and 1,800 corporate customers worldwide, has created an `` earthquake forum'' where people concerned about what's happening to loved ones and friends in the wake of the quake can leave messages and information.

<TEXT>
 An inner-city grocery store is asking shoppers to pay a quarter deposit to be part of its carriage trade. Hoping to keep shopping carts where they belong, <ORGANIZATION> Waldbaum </ORGANIZATION>'s on Main Street has been testing the deposit system since Tuesday. The cart handles have been fitted with a locking mechanism with a key on a heavy chain that connects to the lock on the next cart in line. Shoppers must slip a quarter into the lock to release their cart. When they return the cart and fit the key from its neighboring cart back in again, a quarter pops back out. Store manager <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said the lockup system is widely used in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` Being an inner-city store, we've got quite a problem with losing carriages,'' <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said. `` I'd estimate that last year we spent $ 25,000 on them. We spend maybe 60 hours a week, at $ 5 or $ 6 an hour, just shagging the lot for carriages.'' In addition, <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON>'s pays a woman with a pickup truck $ 100 a week to scout out wayward carts. Though a 25-cent deposit will not stop a determined thief, <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said he hopes it will encourage young people in particular to bring back any stray carts they find. Not all customers have been as receptive to the deposits as the store manager. `` It's a hassle getting a quarter,'' <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> said Thursday. `` You might not have one.''

 A 7-year-old girl whose need for a new liver as an infant helped spur the nation's organ transplant policy has been discharged from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. She left Thursday afternoon, though doctors remained unsure what caused a bout of internal bleeding. She will stay in the area with her parents at least until the middle of next week, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanik </PERSON> said. Doctors on Oct. 9 removed the youngster's enlarged spleen in the belief that it had caused three bouts of internal bleeding within a month. She was discharged on Saturday, but was readmitted the following day when she suffered more bleeding several hours after leaving the hospital. <PERSON> Stanik </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> has had no more bleeding since re-entering the hospital. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> was born Nov. 26, 1981, with biliary atresia, a condition in which the liver's bile ducts are blocked. She received a liver at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 a few days after her father, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>, made a televised appeal for a donor during a convention at the American Academy of Pediatricians. Doctors during the spleen removal surgery were able to examine <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>'s liver, and said it and her other organs were normal. <PERSON> Stanik </PERSON> said doctors do not think the liver has anything to do with the girl's current problems. <PERSON> Stanik </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>'s spirits are good, although she still hopes to return to her <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, home in time for Halloween. `` She seems to be handling things quite well,'' <PERSON> Stanik </PERSON> said.

 A state grand jury has subpoenaed witnesses in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and other states in a new investigation into the 1976 car-bomb slaying of investigative reporter <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON>, sources said. Among those subpoenaed, sources familiar with the investigation told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, was <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a figure in the original <LOCATION> Bolles </LOCATION> investigation. The sources demanded anonymity, saying they feared prosecution under an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> law making it a crime to disclose grand jury matters. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 60, did not return a call from the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> but was quoted in today's editions of The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> as confirming that he had been served with the subpoena by aides to Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>.

The man convicted of planting the bomb, racing dog owner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, is in prison, but no mastermind has ever been convicted. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> arranged for <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> to fly to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havasu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> a few hours after the bombing.

<HEAD>Medellin Drug Cartel Suspects Captured In Mexico</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Local Mexican officials may have given protection to two Colombian drug-runners linked to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel and arrested in the southern <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION>, federal police say. Federal officials on Thursday announced their capture of the nephews of two major Colombian drug kingpins, saying they had broken up a ring that flew cocaine into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and shipped it by boat to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The Colombians and eight other men were captured Sunday at a clandestine airstrip in the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, said federal police commander <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON>, head of the narcotics interdiction forces. `` We imagine they made an arrangement for protection,'' <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON> said. He said police were investigating the matter. Two other men were captured in the resort city of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON> said. Authorities said they waited to announce the arrests because they had hoped to capture more accomplices. They said they were searching for another Colombian suspect. <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON> also said that an airplane carrying drugs to <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> escaped when someone on the ground warned it by radio that Mexican police were at the clandestine airstrip. Captured were ringleaders <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, a nephew of <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Isunza </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, a nephew of <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, known as `` El Mexicano'' because of his interest in <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> culture, are top members of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and are among the world's most-wanted drug traffickers. <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Isunza </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> were their uncles' direct representatives in the smuggling operation. He said he did not know whether the two were wanted in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug-related charges. Asked whether the two might be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Valverde </PERSON> answered, `` Anything is possible.'' Commander <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorrabaquio </PERSON> said the group brought cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> by air to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, then shipped it by boat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, usually to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cali </PERSON> cocaine cartels account for an estimated 80 percent of cocaine shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Traffickers in that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country have operated with relative impunity over the years by intimidating or paying off judges. But on Aug. 19 the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government declared war against cocaine barons after traffickers assassinated the country's leading presidential candidate. That included seizing the property of alleged traffickers and reinstating an extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In response, cocaine barons began a bombing and terror campaign in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Beijing Plans Strict Punishment For Prostitution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> lawmakers have called for jails to be built to house prostitutes and severe punishment, including the death sentence, for anyone who induces or coerces women into prostitution. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said today the municipal government was discussing a draft bill to give the capital its first anti-prostitution statutes. It quoted <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Changyi </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, as saying prostitution had re-emerged in the city and evolved fairly quickly since the early 1980s. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> gave no figures except to say there were many more people involved in prostitution now than in 1985, when there were about 100 cases. He that only four cases of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases were discovered in 1984, compared to about 1,000 last year. The draft regulations call for the city to set up a penitentiary for those involved in prostitution and enforce strict punishment, including the death sentence, for procurers. Foreigners involved in prostitution will be punished according to the law, and those with sexually transmitted diseases expelled from the country, according to the regulations. The Communist government nearly succeeded in eliminating prostitution after taking over in 1949, but the practice has returned in recent years with the country's increased exposure to the outside world. Prostitution has made its strongest comeback in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and other cities of southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that are influenced by neighboring <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Two Canton men were executed in 1987 for running a prostitution ring. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has national laws against prostitution, but penalties are generally light. According to a 1986 law, women caught selling sexual favors are detained for less than 15 days or, in more serious cases, sent to labor reform camps.

<TEXT>
 Residents camped out today in this earthquake-stricken beach town as workers faced repair jobs on hundreds of damaged buildings and on a ruptured sewer line that leaked effluent into <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Six people were killed following Tuesday's quake and the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> emergency services office estimated 10,000 of the county's 229,000 residents were displaced. One of the dead was <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, whose body was found Thursday in the rubble of <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Thirty people had kept a vigil since Tuesday's quake Five were arrested late Wednesday when they broke through a barricade after learning rescue efforts were suspended for the night, police said. County officials estimated that <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, on the north end of <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> 90 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, sustained $ 350 million damage and unincorporated county areas sustained $ 400 million damage. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was scheduled to make an inspection tour today. Many of the newly homeless lived in the 250 homes destroyed Tuesday and the rest were `` people afraid to go in their houses, who do n't have any water or do n't have any electricity,'' said county spokeswoman <PERSON> Dinah </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. Power was restored to all but 3,600 customers in the county and water was fit to drink in the city of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, population 50,000, and in much of the county by Thursday night, officials said. Aftershocks also caused problems. A 4.3 magnitude aftershock triggered a landslide on Highway 17 Thursday afternoon, guaranteeing that the primary route north to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> would remain closed for another three weeks, a county spokeswoman said. The tremor also rocked a civic center shelter in downtown <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> where nearly 200 people have been housed and some 3,000 fed each day since the quake. Many others have been camping out. In the city, major damage occurred in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> business district and a residential area near marshy <LOCATION> Neary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lagoon </LOCATION> where about 40 homes were destroyed. Communities to the north and south also were damaged. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> on Thursday surveyed damage to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Garden Mall and promised local officials state aid. An estimated 30 percent of the businesses along the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> will have to be razed. Unreinforced masonry structures along an entire block of downtown <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> also must come down. Elsewhere, an unknown volume of sewage continued to leak into <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> from ruptures in a county sewer line, closing beaches in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. Authorities also continued to evacuate residents whose homes were threatened by landslides or destroyed by the quake near <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> area in mountains north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. Despite the widespread damage, residents began resuming routine as businesses slowly continued to reopen, mostly on a limited basis. Business owners said it would be at least several days until they could start getting reliable shipments over roads leading into <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, many of which were entirely or partially closed. Outside a shelter for the homeless, though, pictures drawn by children showed some youngsters had hope for the future. Ten-year-old <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Charnas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> drew the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, flowers sprouting from a crack and a rainbow nearby. `` Because that's what I think it will look like when the cracks are gone, I think there will be rainbows,'' <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A nurse charged with poisoning at least seven patients, four of them fatally, told one, `` This will make you feel much better,'' before slipping him a paralyzing injection, said the patient who survived. `` I could n't move, I could n't breathe,'' 75-year-old <PERSON> Gerolamo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON> testified Thursday. `` I was thinking, how long is it going to last before I die?'' <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON> was the first witness in the opening day of the murder trial of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>, 27. <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> is charged with four counts of second-degree murder and three counts of assault for allegedly administering lethal doses of Pavulon, a muscle relaxant, to patients at Good Samaritan Hospital in 1987. He worked at the hospital in the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islip </LOCATION> for six months as a nurse. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Colins </PERSON> called <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> `` a monster dressed in nurse's whites'' and `` the living embodiment of your worst nightmare.'' <PERSON> Colins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> first experimented on mice and then moved on to `` terribly vulnerable human beings for his stated purposes of improving his image and reputation.'' Police say <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> admitted in written and videotaped confessions that he gave the injections to patients with the intention of reviving them so he would look like a hero. <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON> testified that a bearded man in a white medical coat came into his hospital room one day and asked him how he was feeling. The former patient said that when he responded, `` Not bad,'' the man opened his coat, took out a needle and told him, `` This will make you feel much better.'' <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> then injected the drug into his intravenous tube and left the room, said <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON>. `` I became like dead,'' said <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON>. He managed to press the emergency alarm and his regular nurse, <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, came in and helped revive him. <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON> said he still could n't talk or see moments later when he heard <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> return to the room. He gestured towards <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>'s voice, hoping Mrs. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> would catch on According to <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>, `` What did you do?'' <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> answered, `` Nothing,'' and left the room. Mrs. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> was scheduled to testify today when the trial resumes. As <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON> spoke, <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> sat at the defense table with his eyes downcast. His parents, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>, retired schoolteachers who recently moved to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, sat behind him. <PERSON> Kucich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> was visiting his children when he was hospitalized for a heart attack in 1987. He returned for the trial. Twenty-two patients' bodies were exhumed during the investigation. Pavulon poisoning was found in six bodies but could be established as a cause of death in only four. The other two cases resulted in assault charges against <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>. The third assault charge is for the attack on Kucich, the only known survivor. <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Naiburg </PERSON>, admitted that <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> gave the injections but he asked the jury to consider a lesser charge than second-degree murder.

<HEAD>$1.3 Million Lotto Ticket Found in Cookie Jar</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON> looked on his dresser, in his desk drawers and under his mattress before he remembered the cookie jar _ which was where he'd unknowingly stuffed a $ 1.3 million winning Lotto ticket last year. `` I just stuck it in and forgot all about it,'' said <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON>, who overcame the memory lapse to become a millionaire just four days before his ticket would have become worthless. <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON>, a correction officer, showed up Wednesday at the lottery offices to collect his prize from the Oct. 22, 1988, drawing. `` Is n't that something? This was down to the nitty-gritty. Another week and I would have lost it,'' said <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Metuchen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, after a Thursday news conference announcing his sweet find. <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON>, 58, bought the winning ticket at the Towne and <LOCATION> Country </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deli </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, selecting the numbers 7, 9, 13, 21, 34 and 43. But he dumped the ticket into the cookie jar and never checked to see if he won. Last week, <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON> noticed a sign in the deli telling Lotto players to check their tickets because a $ 1.3 million prize was still unclaimed. A newspaper article pinned next to it showed the missing ticket contained his weekly numbers. `` I looked everywhere, because I saw my numbers. I went through dressers, drawers, under the mattress. I went through a bag where I throw all my losing tickets,'' said <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON>. Finally, he had a feeling about the cookie jar and went to check it out: `` There it was, all by itself.'' Winners have one year to produce their tickets; <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON> showed up with just four days to spare. State lottery spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowlton </PERSON> said this was the longest anybody had ever waited to claim a prize. Two other people picked winning numbers in the drawing, and both had already claimed their shares of the $ 4 million jackpot. <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON> _ whose winning numbers combined his birthday, anniversary, daughter's age and license plate number _ said the windfall wo n't have any immediate effect on his lifestyle. `` I'm not going to retire. I'm a young 58, going on 25,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fatal Shooting Leads to Charge Against Boy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors charged a 12-year-old boy with manslaughter in the shotgun slaying of his 7-year-old sister, although they said the shooting was an accident. Prosecutor <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> said the boy, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, was grossly negligent in deliberately aiming a short-barreled shotgun that killed <PERSON> Calandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. `` If at the time a gun goes off you've got control of the gun and you're pointing it at another individual, that crosses the threshold of culpable negligence,'' said <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Mattie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, said when told of the charge Wednesday: `` I do n't understand it. But we will deal with it. We will deal with it.'' The two children were alone at home at the time of the Sept. 13 shooting, and the boy told investigators conflicting stories of what happened, said state attorney's spokesman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON>. Investigators later determined that <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> took the gun from an unlocked cabinet in his 18-year-old brother's bedroom and played with it for a few minutes around the house before returning to the bedroom to put it away. When he saw his sister, Means said the boy pointed the gun and told her `` something to the effect of ` Do n't worry, it's not dangerous.''' The gun then went off, blasting the girl in the face. Means said the boy's conduct was so careless that it rises to the level of culpable negligence, the standard used to prove manslaughter.

<HEAD>Oakland Suffered $1.3 Billion Damage: Mayor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A collapsed freeway has drawn most of the attention in the earthquake's aftermath, but the temblor also caused $ 1.3 billion worth of damage elsewhere in the city, according to Mayor <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Among the buildings found uninhabitable was City Hall, an ornate structure built in 1911. Crucial city services have been relocated. The building's historic value makes it an obvious candidate for repair, according to <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroff </PERSON>, emergency services coordinator for the city. `` But it's difficult to assess at this point whether they could repair it to the point where it was real safe or they would have to take it down,'' she said. `` Depending on the assistance we get from the federal government, they will or will not make it a safe place to be.'' The historic <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> railroad station in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> may have to be torn down after the discovery of three big cracks running through the structure, officials said. `` One more good shake and the whole thing would have come down,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. Some city staff members, including the city manager's office, have moved operations from City Hall to the Fire Department. The section of Interstate 880 that buckled in Tuesday's earthquake trapped an undetermined number of drivers inside Rescue workers continued efforts around the clock in hope of finding survivors. Elsewhere in the city, workers inspected damaged buildings. Hard-hit was the downtown area. The earthquake caused enough damage to require the replacement of 1,400 residential units worth $ 29.4 million, <PERSON> Schroff </PERSON> said. More than 100 elderly people whose homes were destroyed have gone to shelters, she said. Thirteen commercial buildings worth $ 234 million must be replaced and 200 buildings suffered damages totaling another $ 750 million. A dozen public buildings, including City Hall, suffered $ 250 million in damages. Modern buildings suffered along with the old, including one structure under construction as part of the City Center project. Girders at the top of 14 stories of framework were askew and part of a fallen construction elevator lay crumpled on the ground. `` I certainly did n't expect we would have that much damage with a 7.0 earthquake. It's shocking and upsetting,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Spees </PERSON>. City government should be fully operational within four or five days but it will take months before the city is back to normal, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> sustained `` quite a bit of damage to artifacts and early <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> exhibits in the history wing,'' according to museum spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mumma </PERSON>. Along Broadway, the heart of downtown, most of the broken glass has been swept from the sidewalks, but police tape and temporary cyclone fences kept people away from damaged buildings where bricks and windows had fallen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an assistant to the mayor, said the earthquake will not hurt the momentum of the city's revitalization effort. `` It may slow us down a little, but only a little,'' he said.

<HEAD>CBS's `48 Hours' Has Telling Finale</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> thought the `` 48 Hours'' earthquake broadcast was going well enough. Then a disturbance broke out off-camera, interrupting the live show. Designed to report the news both quickly and with a personal spin, `` 48 Hours'' was handed a perfect finale Thursday: Just a few feet from the CBS cameras, the father of a man believed killed on collapsed Interstate 880 was accusing the <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> mayor of negligent homicide. `` It was a telling moment,'' anchorman Rather said in an interview after the show. `` It said a lot about fears and frustrations and what happens to people in situations like this. `` When you talk about earthquake victims, you have to remember that's one person at a time. What gets drowned out in a lot of newscasts on a story like this is the story of one person. One person like Mr. <PERSON> Rubi </PERSON>'s son, up there in the wreckage. `` That's something I and a lot of other people can relate to.'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubi </PERSON> assailed Mayor <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> during an evening news conference in front of <LOCATION> Interstate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> 880 </LOCATION>, saying that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> `` was directly responsible for my son's death.'' <PERSON> Rubi </PERSON> said his son <PERSON> Juan </PERSON>, 28, was killed because <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had failed to maintain the freeway. The younger <PERSON> Rubi </PERSON>'s body is not among those recovered from the wreckage so far. The elder <PERSON> Rubi </PERSON>, profiled on `` 48 Hours'' shortly before his outburst, was taken from the scene in a police squad car but not arrested, authorities said. For the weekly news magazine, the <PERSON> Rubi </PERSON> incident was an unfortunate but nevertheless valuable break. Like the other networks and media organizations swarming around the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> has labored to find fresh ways to tell a complex story. `` The first problem you have is getting on the air in the first place,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCesare </PERSON>, vice president of news coverage for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. He cited an array of logistical problems, from no telephones to no on-site editing bays and a shortage of mobile broadcast facilities. One danger of incorporating journalists themselves in the news accounts and importing high-ticket anchors like Rather, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> is that they can become as much a part of the story as the story itself. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyward </PERSON>, the executive producer of `` 48 Hours,'' said the arrival of the network stars was only a reflection of the story's importance `` There is an advantage for the anchor to be in the city _ it's certainly better than in the studio,'' <PERSON> Heyward </PERSON> said Yet when <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> arrived at the scene, just the opposite was true. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> pulled into the destroyed freeway scene on Wednesday morning and, minutes later, delivered a live dispatch that demonstrated the hazards of capturing the story both quickly and accurately. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said rescue workers had labored through the night to save lives on the collapsed freeway. Anyone who had spent the early-morning hours there, however, would have said very little happened after midnight.

 A ferry boat armada is being prepared as transit officials brace for a monumental traffic jam on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area freeways Monday when most workers return to their jobs in the quake-ravaged region. Some roads already have been gripped by gridlock despite fewer commuters in the aftermath of Tuesday's quake, which shut down the vital bridge linking <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and the rest of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Ferry boats may relieve some of the pressure on the highways. `` We've got three days to get ready for Monday with as much of an armada as possible,'' state Sen. <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said at an emergency meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. `` I do n't see much alternative to water over the next couple of weeks,'' while the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> is repaired, <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said. A 50-foot section of the bridge collapsed during the quake and could take up to two months to repair. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said some 45 vessels, ranging from elegant dining cruise boats to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> landing craft, could be pressed into service to carry up to 60,000 commuters across the waters. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said 20 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> boats were made available by the 12th Naval District. But that still leaves at least 50,000 additional commuters who normally take the bridge. `` It'll get bad Monday,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, deputy district director for public transportation at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. He encouraged people to stay home and work through personal computers or to adopt flexible work hours. On Thursday, about 60 percent of the usual number of commuters struggled to reach work by train, boat or car. Many found themselves in traffic jams. Some arrived at buildings still in the dark or with only partial power. Others turned back after facing up to four-hour delays on the overburdened highways. `` People are just trying to get back to reality, to make life like it was before,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomberlin </PERSON> of Traffic Central, a private traffic information service. Some commuters from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> took a circuitous route south to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and then north to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> that added hours to the average hour-long drive they would have taken across the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Continuing Harassment Campaign, Cops Haul Off Activist Before Dawn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police hauled a prominent human rights campaigner from his <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> home before dawn today, holding him for several hours one day after detaining 15 opposition activists in another raid, an emigre source said. Jan Urban, a leading member of the Charter 77 human rights movement and other pro-democracy groups, was taken from his home by police at 5:30 a.m., said the source, who asked not to be identified. Sources in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> said Urban was released abouutu four hours later after apparently being warned not to engage in further dissident activity. <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s foreign minister during the 1968 <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring, was among those arrested Thursday and held for several hours by police who raided a meeting the activists were holding with international human rights campaigners. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights monitor <PERSON> Jeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Laber </PERSON> also was briefly detained. Police have made at least three other police raids on activists over the past week. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s Communist authorities, unlike their counterparts in neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, have firmly rejected dialogue with opposition groups who seek a more open society. A wave of pro-democracy demonstrations in January has been answered with carefully targeted harassment of leading activists and the jailing of lesser known campaigners whose detention stirs less protest at home and abroad. The current wave of harassment may be connected with the upcoming Oct. 28 anniversary of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s independence in 1918. Last year, about 5,000 peaceful demonstrators gathered at a banned rally to mark the anniversary and were dispersed by police using water cannon, tear gas, dogs and batons. The Communist party daily Rude Pravo has already warned that anybody attending a similar rally this year could face prosecution.

 Victims of a series of deadly earthquakes in rural northern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said today they owed their lives to an initial temblor that sent them fleeing from their homes before a second brought the dwellings crashing down. At least 29 people died and more than 10,000 homes were reported destroyed by the quakes, the region's worst in 13 years. The official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said more than 150 people were injured, many seriously, in the quakes that hit <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> provinces late Wednesday and early Thursday. The temblors, centered about 135 miles west of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, measured up to 6.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and were felt in the capital. `` This was the worst quake we've ever had,'' <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rongzhen </PERSON>, a peasant farmer in <LOCATION> Xicaitian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, told a Western reporter. `` I was asleep in the house when the first quake woke me up. It rocked the walls and we went outside. With the second quake the house collapsed.'' About half the mud and wattle homes in the impoverished dusty town of 820 were heavily damaged. A short distance away, in <LOCATION> Bucun </LOCATION>, a village of 1,280, not one home was left standing. People there also said the first quake, which hit with a magnitude of 5.7 shortly before 11 p.m. Wednesday, drove them from their homes, which toppled when the 6.1 quake hit two hours later. `` It was like waves,'' some in the walled village said. `` It was very loud.'' Two Bucun villagers, a man of about 60 and his octogenarian mother, were killed as he carried her from the house. Two plain wooden caskets with straw covers were set up in their home, which was open to the sky with the walls only partly standing. A neighbor wailed as she viewed the caskets, at the head of which biscuits were placed in an apparent religious offering. Many people spent Thursday night huddled around campfires and sleeping in makeshift straw tents. Temperatures dipped to near freezing on the treeless brown plain and people were wrapped in heavy greatcoats. One woman was seen cleaning her now roofless home around the tent she had set up inside. Today, some people rummaged through the destruction, others sat on the rubble doing nothing. Residents said that in winter temperatures dip as low as 22 below zero on the exposed plain, which ranges up to 4,000 feet above sea level. They said it would be impossible to rebuild their homes before then. District officials inspected the damage, but no outside assistance had arrived to lead relief operations. Raw film footage from the <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> provincial television, seen in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> today, showed rescue workers armed only with shovels and wooden poles digging through the rubble of destroyed homes looking for victims. The film showed medical personnel treating people with badly bloodied heads and broken bones in temporary outdoor clinics. People dressed in overcoats huddled around bonfires. Children wrapped in colorful blankets slept in piles of hay. Most of the stricken area is populated by peasants who scrape wheat, corn and other grain crops out of the infertile, deeply eroded soil. In many places, only crumbled mud walls and the blue arched and latticed wood doorways common to the area remained standing. The film showed bread and medical supplies being delivered to damaged areas. The <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily said 1,000 soldiers were mobilized to help in the rescue operation. Officials in <LOCATION> Datong </LOCATION>, a major coal mining and rail center of about 500,000 in northern <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION>, said the city escaped serious destruction. They said the quakes had not damaged <LOCATION> Datong </LOCATION>'s famous Yungang Caves which hold thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> paintings and statues dating back to the 5th century. The first quake struck about 20 hours after the devastating temblor in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, but seismologists said there was no apparent link between the two. There were at least six quakes registering 5.0 or more on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and the last major aftershock, of 5.1, was recorded at 6:29 p.m. Thursday. People within a radius of 300 miles felt the shocks. Residents in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> scrambled from their beds, but there were no reports of damage in the capital. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhangshun </PERSON> said the quakes were the strongest to hit northern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since a calamitous 1976 quake that measured at least 7.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and killed 240,000 people in northeastern <LOCATION> Tangshan </LOCATION>. Earthquakes are frequent in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, with more than 30 this year above 5.0, a magnitude capable of causing damage in populated areas. Five earthquakes, measuring up to 6.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, hit western <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> in June and July, killing 11 people. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground movement as recorded by seismographs. The open-ended scale is logarithmic, meaning that each degree of intensity is 10 times stronger than the last. Thus the 6.9 magnitude quake that hit <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> is 10 times stronger than one registering 5.9 on the scale.

According to lawyers, <PERSON> Nofemela </PERSON> said in an affadavit he was one of four security policemen who killed activist <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> <PERSON> Mxenge </PERSON> in 1981 under orders from senior officers. <PERSON> Nofemela </PERSON> also said he was partly responsible for the killings of eight other political activists ordered by his superiors. <PERSON> Nofemela </PERSON>, 32, was convicted in 1987 of murdering a white farmer in a case apparently without political overtones. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mothle </PERSON>, a director of the Pretoria-based organization <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said lawyers who studied <PERSON> Nofemela </PERSON>'s affidavit found it credible, containing accurate details related to <PERSON> Mxenge </PERSON>'s killings <PERSON> Mxenge </PERSON>'s body was found outside a <LOCATION> Durban-area </LOCATION> stadium in November 1981. He had been stabbed more than 40 times. <PERSON> Mxenge </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>, an attorney and activist, was killed in August 1985. They are among several dozen anti-apartheid activists _ black and white _ who have been killed in recent years in cases that have never been solved. Many activists believe most or all of the killings were carried out by elements of the security forces. After the assassination in May of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, a white activist and university lecturer, police formed a special investigative force to probe both that killing and unsolved bombings of offices of anti-apartheid groups. No arrests have been made. <PERSON> Mothle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nofemela </PERSON>'s claims initially would be investigated by the office of the <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> attorney general. `` We hope they wo n't turn it over to the police, but we have no control over that,'' he said. The three hangings Friday raised to 45 the number of executions so far this year. One of the prisoners was a mixed-race man convicted of killing two residents of an retirement home. The other two were blacks convicted of murder during a 1986 robbery. Two of the men hanged this year were white, the rest black or of mixed-race. The number of hangings so far this year is much lower than in recent years, such as 1987, when a record 164 people were hanged. The government says 60 condemned prisoners have received reprieves this year. More than 200 prisoners, nearly all of them black men, remain on Death Row. Anti-apartheid leaders in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including senior members of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement freed last Sunday, have listed an end to executions as one of their conditions for agreeing to enter negotiations with the white-led government.

<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is trying to rig pre-independence elections in the territory through a `` reign of terror.'' The former presidential candidate made his remarks Thursday in an appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which handles independence questions. Meanwhile, black African nations called for an urgent <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting to condemn <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s administration in the territory. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said debate would probably begin early next week. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was trying to rig the Nov. 7-11 elections to hurt the leading black nationalist party, the <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> People's Organization known as <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of promoting `` a reign of terror taking part in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> today'' by keeping former Namibian commandos and paramilitary police on the payroll but letting them act as `` armed vigilantes'' for anti-SWAPO parties. He also criticized the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for not sending enough peacekeepers to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to prevent what he called `` a climate of intimidation so as to make a free and fair election impossible.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> decided early this year to send only 4,650 military observers, rather than 7,500, as a cost-cutting move. Namibians are to vote for a constituent assembly to organize the first independent, black majority-ruled government in the territory of 1.3 million. The former German colony has been ruled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since 1915. In December, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> signed accords with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreeing to cooperate with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence as <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> withdraws its 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Surgeons Deliver Baby from Dying Mother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A surgical team at <ORGANIZATION> Suburban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> delivered a baby boy from his dying mother about 30 minutes after the woman suffered massive injuries in a traffic accident, hospital officials said. Surgeons removed the infant by Caesarean section about 12:50 p.m. Thursday, a half-hour after the gravely injured mother, <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 27, had suffered cardiac arrest and stopped breathing, a hospital spokesman said. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, who was in a two-car collision, had been due to deliver the baby in about a week. `` You have to realize, when the mother's system shuts down, the baby stops getting oxygen,'' said the spokesman, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortier </PERSON>. `` Obviously there's a lot of amazement, probably wonder, and a lot of happiness'' that he survived. Dr. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanowell </PERSON>, who helped deliver the child, called it unusual that the baby survived in light of his mother's injuries. Doctors were unable to restore <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>'s breathing or make her heart beat on its own, and she was pronounced dead about 45 minutes after the birth. The baby boy, weighing about seven pounds, suffered `` oxygen deprivation'' and was hospitalized in serious condition Thursday night, officials said. `` It's extraordinary, but it's something we think about in emergency medicine all the time,'' Dr. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, another trauma surgeon, said of the emergency Caesarean section. `` It's something we anticipate and we worry about it. It's one of those heroic interventions we fear, yet hope will be successful.'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said surgeons did not have to choose between saving the mother or the baby. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> technically was not dead when she was wheeled into the emergency room, <PERSON> Hanowell </PERSON> said, but she had suffered massive internal injuries, `` and if no one was breathing for her and pumping on her chest, she certainly would have been dead.'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> had no other children. Her husband was with her at the hospital, officials said.

<BYLINE>Eds: To DELETE extraneous word, SUB 12th graf, `Under his ... international
affairs.' Picks up 13th, `Many Soviets ...' ^By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pravda told its readers today that a confidant of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is replacing its conservative editor, who had resisted letting the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily fully embrace the new openness sweeping the Soviet press. In a front-page report, <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> had resigned and been replaced by <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, an advisor to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for the last year and a former editor of the party's theoretical monthly journal <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON> The move appears to assure that the voice of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will now reflect more clearly the views of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his reform-minded allies. Pravda is the country's most authoritative newspaper, but its circulation has lagged under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as readers turn to livelier more informative newspapers. Its editor sits in on closed meetings of the ruling Politburo. The removal of <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, a 66-year-old throwback to the rule of <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, marks a further attempt by the Soviet president to clean house of conservatives. Last month, three were retired from the Politburo. The change at Pravda's helm also capped a turbulent week in the Soviet press that first saw <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rebuke trailblazing editors as taking glasnost too far, threatening to sack them. Some Soviet observers interpreted his criticism one week ago of the editors who are the most outspoken practitioners of glasnost as a way of softening the blow of <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>'s removal for party conservatives. They interpreted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s tactics as taking the middle course at a time of rising tension over the poor state of the economy and ethnic unrest. The departure of <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> was announced by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday and also reported on state-run television in its nightly news report. Pravda said the Politburo had on Thursday accepted <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>'s request that he be transfered to `` scientific work.'' <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, 60, is credited with formulating <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s foreign policy that places priority on fostering values common to all mankind, rather than encouraging class struggle. <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> took over the party newspaper in 1976, during what is now condemned as a period of stagnation when Pravda was accused of masking more often than disclosing the truth. Under his tutelage, the paper's circulation fell as it lagged behind other papers that more frankly cover national and international affairs. Many Soviets turn now to publications such as Arguments and Facts and <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION>, which are filled with breezily written criticisms of the system. Arguments and Facts, a weekly, has a circulation of 26 million, more than double last year's figure, and is the country's most popular newspaper. At an Oct. 13 special party meeting with newspaper editors, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> assailed some as sowing discord by being overly critical of the leadership. He reportedly called specifically for the resignation of the editor of Arguments and Facts, <PERSON> Vladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON> _ apparently for publishing a reader survey that gave members of a minority opposition faction of the legislature the highest ratings, questioning <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s popularity. But Soviet lawmakers, the weekly newspaper's workers and an international organization, The <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Protect Journalists, have rallied to defend the <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON>. On Thursday, members of <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON>'s staff said they had formed a work committee and elected him head in a bid to protect him from being fired. Pravda last month suffered an embarrassment when it reprinted an Italian newspaper's article claiming popular Communist maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> boozed and shopped his way through the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during a recent speaking tour. A few days later, Pravda apologized, saying the story could not be substantiated. Like <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> is a full member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Ideological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>' Philosophy and Law department <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> said his boss would be going to the academy, to which he has for some time to wanted devote his attention more fully.

<HEAD>Dinkins Unable to Explain Discrepancy in Valuing Stock Holdings</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION> _ Democratic mayoral candidate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> says he's not sure why he valued a cable TV company's stock at $ 1 million but sold it to his son for a fraction of the sum, according to a published report today <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in an interview Thursday that when he learned that his stock in <ORGANIZATION> Inner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> was worth $ 1 million or more, he could not believe it. He said he learned of the estimate by company officials from his secretary. `` The day the secretary says this is true, I thought it was almost like a big joke,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> recalled. `` I said, ` Like, I'm a millionaire.''' He said that to avoid a conflict of interest when he became <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, he sold the shares to his son <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in 1986 for $ 58,000 _ a price he said he randomly picked without consulting tax lawyers or accountants. The Democratic front-runner provided no explanation for the different values placed on the stock, saying, `` It did n't seem to matter much'' at the time. Asked what could have caused the discrepancy, he said, `` I really do n't know.'' The true worth of <LOCATION> Inner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s stock _ difficult to assess because the company is privately held rather than publicly traded _ is important because <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> might owe gift taxes on its sale, say tax experts and campaign aides for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' opponent, <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. New York Newsday on Thursday quoted the general counsel of <LOCATION> Inner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as saying the stock in 1984 was conservatively worth $ 4,292 per share, or $ 2.5 million for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' 588 shares. But <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said the company's general counsel, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON>, might have inflated the price of <LOCATION> Inner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> stock to obtain a loan, <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> said today. <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday he had not inflated the value of the stock but could offer no explanation for the different prices. `` I made that statement on my judgment based on what the value was in my judgment. He's right and I'm right,'' <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON> said. The Daily News reported Thursday that <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' former secretary, <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>, said her boss had set the stock's value at `` $ 1.3 million or something like that'' when he submitted a sworn, confidential report to Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. The report was submitted when <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> was a candidate for director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>. `` Based on the publicly available information, it appears to me that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> owes between $ 285,120 and $ 848,291 to the federal government and as much as $ 195,626 more to the state,'' said <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, according to today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and Daily News. Powers said he was a tax lawyer. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said he was reviewing his tax forms and any liability he might have. He accused <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> of `` gutter politics'' after the latter's week of unrelenting criticism on <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' handling of the stock sale He threatened to respond with negative attacks of his own.

 Typhoon <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> moved out to sea today after battering the northern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> with winds up to 127 mph and leaving at least four people dead and thousands homeless. In a final typhoon bulletin at 4 a.m., the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> weather bureau said that <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON>, the strongest storm to strike the country this year, was about 240 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> blew ashore Thursday, but forecaster <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON> <PERSON> Dagupa </PERSON> said the winds had weakened today to 103 mph and was moving west at 14 mph. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said two people were killed in <LOCATION> Isabela </LOCATION> province when they were struck by irons sheets torn off from houses. One person was crushed to death by a falling tree in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> province and another died in a landslide on the outskirts of the mountain resort town of <LOCATION> Baguio </LOCATION>, 130 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said more than 22,100 people sought temporary shelter in schoolhouses and government centers or reported their houses either damaged or destroyed. Officials said at least 6,106 houses were destroyed in six northern provinces hit by the typhoon. Officials said many northern provinces lost electricity when high winds toppled power lines. Fallen trees littered the national highway and blocked dozens of other roads. Domestic flights from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> to northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> were canceled and the coast guard ordered ships to stay in port in the affected area for the day. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said some jets had been moved to air bases in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> was the third tropical storm to strike the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in two weeks.

In a report on economic performance through September, <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhongji </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, said the year-old austerity program had held the gross national product to $ 30 billion, up only 5 percent from the same period in 1988. National industrial output for September reached $ 29 billion, up only 0.9 percent from the same month last year. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said consumer demand was down, the rise in retail prices had been brought under control and `` the whole economy is taking a favorable turn.'' But he acknowledged that `` no major breakthroughs had been achieved'' in resolving chronic supply-demand imbalances. He said there was serious overstocking of some products because of market slumps and poor circulation of money because many companies are delaying payment of debts. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> also criticized the `` behavior of some enterprise managers and factory directors who still have doubts about the current policy so they do n't exert all their efforts to promote production.'' Since last fall the government has sharply reduced credit available for investment, ordered the suspension of thousands of building projects and tightened central controls over distribution and pricing in an attempt to curb industrial growth that exceeded 20 percent last year and reduce an inflation rate of more than 30 percent. Following the military crackdown of pro-democracy dissent in the spring, the conservatives now in power have also demanded that large state-owned industries be given priority in receiving financing and supplies. Authorities have moved to restrict the growth of small collective and private enterprises that have thrived during the past decade of economic reform. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said the output value of collective enterprises grew 12.5 percent over the first three quarters to $ 87 billion, compared to a growth rate of only 5.2 percent for state-owned industries, which had an output value of $ 162 billion. But he said the growth rate of collective and township enterprises was slowing dramatically. He said 19 to 20 percent of state-owned enterprises continue to operate in the red. He cited the `` deterioration of economic efficiency'' and the serious overstocking of some products. Retail sales were up only 12.3 percent to $ 164 billion, far lower than growth rates of more than 30 percent during a period of panic buying last fall. Institutional buying was up only 6.2 percent, to $ 14 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said that in the first eight months of this year $ 20 billion worth of goods were piled up in warehouses, compared to $ 7.5 billion at the same time last year. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said the average retail price increase so far in 1989 was about 22 percent and continued to fall. In Septmber, prices were up only 13 percent from the same month last year. He said, though, that it will be `` extremely difficult'' to meet the government target of bringing inflation down to 10 percent by year's end.

<HEAD>Production Drops in Key Government Sectors, Grows in Private Sector</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Production fell in seven key sectors, including food and steel, during the third quarter of 1989 while prices and wages grew in an inflationary spiral, according to another gloomy government report published today. The steel, chemical, paper, engineering, transport, food and fodder industries produced less in the first nine months of the year than during the same period of 1988, according to the main statistical office known by its Polish initials GUS. At the same time, there was a 30 percent increase in production from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s private sector, newly liberated from many government regulations. But because the private sector accounts for only about 6 percent of the economy, the report said the growth there could not balance the production decreases in government industries. There were better results from the government's power, mineral, timber, electro-engineering, electronical, textile, clothing and printing industries, the report said. Several factors have been blamed for the production drop: outmoded factories; lack of production materials; factories not paying suppliers for lack of payment from customers; and the flight of workers to the private sector, black-market activities or to work abroad, where they can earn more. Also, former Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Ireneusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekula </PERSON> told a government committee this week that the former government erred in its decision to freeze prices, which caused enterprises and private farmers to cut back production. The government report is the key quarterly analysis of the Polish economy, but it follows numerous other commentaries from the new Solidarity-led government and from Poles themselves on the dire state of finances. The government faces a budget deficit of about $ 2.3 billion, and it could reach $ 4.4 billion by the end of the year without radical cost-cutting steps. An oversupply of money has cleared store shelves of goods and further driven up prices. The price of butter, for example, is up more than 1,000 percent since August. Government controls had kept food prices artificially low. The controls were lifted Aug. 1 as part of the transformation designed to create a market-oriented economy. The economic report said food prices are now 300 percent to 400 percent higher than at the start of the year, while prices of other goods were 200 percent to 300 percent higher. A monthly report for August put overall price increases at 50 percent for that month, which would translate into an annual rate of 600 percent. Employment continued to decline in the five main branches of the government-run economy, with the jobless rate rising from 2.6 percent in January to 5.4 percent in September. Workers have been reported to be abandoning their jobs in the state industries for higher salaries in the private sector. Pay rates rose substantially in the five main branches of the economy, from a monthly $ 42 in the first quarter to $ 99 in the third quarter. By mid-October, the average overall salary was $ 114 a month.

 Atlantis' five astronauts plunged into a heavy schedule of medical, scientific and photographic experiments today after being awakened by three rousing college fight songs. `` We've got a full day planned for you,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> told the astronauts, and even before they had breakfast, they were asked to take pictures of <LOCATION> Gibralter </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> for a film being made about <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s environment. The wakeup songs were from colleges attended by the three mission specialists on board, `` <ORGANIZATION> Boomer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sooners </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> UConn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huskies </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` Victory March.'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON> attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. The flight plan today called for the crew to continue experiments that measure Earth's damaged ozone layer and study the effects of weightlessness on the human body, the processing of polymers and the growth of corn and ice crystals. The nuclear-powered <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe the astronauts deployed about six hours after blastoff Wednesday was zipping across the solar system at 9,000 mph in great shape, officials reported. The $ 1.5 billion probe's course for its six-year, 2.4-billion-mile trip to Jupiter involved more than 400,000 miles of travel by midday today. Once it reaches Jupiter, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> is expected to give the best look yet of another planet and find clues to the universe's origin. <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> was pronounced in `` perfect shape'' and `` right on course'' Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Atlantis </PERSON> also was given a clean bill of health after the crew members restored a cooling system that shut down the previous day when it overheated, cutting in a backup unit. Atlantis is scheduled to land at 2:38 p.m. EDT Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The other shuttle crew members are commander <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON>. On Thursday, Mrs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> demonstrated a retinal photography experiment that could be seen on <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> satellite television. With swimming goggles strapped around her head, Mrs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> steadied herself on the shuttle's middeck while <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> pressed a camera to the right goggle to photograph her retina. `` We're trying to hold ourselves steady, which is probably the hardest part of this task,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a medical doctor. Researchers want to study the 35mm camera slides to determine if there are any changes in the eye's vessels in zero gravity. Such changes could indicate some brain swelling, and researchers want to find out if that is related to motion sickness in space. Also Thursday night, a camera in the cargo bay showed spectacular views of Typhoon <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` It's a real big storm,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. Weather permitting, the astronauts hope to capture images of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the Grand Canyon, the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and several Japanese volcanoes. They are using a special IMAX camera that produces detailed film that can be shown on extra-large screens. The film collected today will be used in two movies. The astronauts will try to photograph lightning systems, providing data that researchers say could help develop better weather-predicting methods. A new experiment aboard the shuttle uses a sensitive instrument in the cargo bay to measure the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation. The measurements taken aboard Atlantis will be compared with data being collected at the same time and over the same areas by nearly identical sensors aboard three older <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites. The new data will be used ot help calibrate the satellite sensors. Many people fear depletion of the ozone layer will cause a rise in health problems such as skin cancer. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled the same experiment for six more shuttle flights.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Amnesty International today accused Sudanese government troops of killing 34 civilians in the southern town of <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION> in late July, apparently to avenge the death of a soldier whose truck hit a mine. The international human rights organization said an unspecified number of other civilians were seriously injured in the same incident, in which soldiers dumped the victims' bodies in a well in the northwest section of the town. It said most of the victims were refugees of the Dinka and <PERSON> Luo </PERSON> ethnic groups who had been living in <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION>. They were arrested shortly before being killed, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. The group added it had collected the names of the dead and also of 13 of the injured. The <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> government has not commented on the alleged massacre, but the civilian government, before its ouster in a coup June 30, denied similar allegations against the army. `` Amnesty International is particularly concerned because these killings do not appear to be isolated cases,'' a statement said. `` Its information reveals a persistent pattern of serious human rights violations in the context of the civil war in the south.'' It said many civilians and captured members of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had been killed by the army and government-allied troops. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> urged the Sudanese government to investigate the alleged massacre. It also issued appeals on behalf of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>, ousted in the coup, and his wife, <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Fadil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON>. It said <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> was abused and threatened for refusing to back the new military government, and subjected to a mock execution. The government last week denied a report that <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> was being tortured. A statement said his family has regular visits and that anybody else could visit him for evidence he had not been tortured. The statement did not mention his wife.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> leaders disagreed today over whether they should invest $ 18 billion in a joint fund to protect the environment. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> opposed establishing a <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> fund, arguing that additional resources should be channeled through the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> World Environmental program. Officials of the 49-nation <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, the association of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and its former colonies, said several other leaders also supported holding off on establishing the fund. After discussing the issue, the leaders left for a weekend retreat at <LOCATION> Langkawi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 210 miles from <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. There, they will consider both the final draft of an environmental declaration and try to agree on a joint statement on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the main issue dividing them. Armed police lined the road from the <LOCATION> Langkawi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> airport to the beach resort where the summit delegates will stay. Young <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> women dressed in batik sarongs and white vests greeted each head of government. Hotel workers in white uniforms lined up and, to the accompaniment of guitars, broke into a version of `` Have You Ever Seen The Rain?'' Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said Thursday the leaders will try to `` reach a concensus'' over the weekend on strategy toward <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. His plan stipulates that the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> call on international banks to tighten financial sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, the sole opponent of sanctions, has argued that South African President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s moves toward reform deserve encouragement. During the morning debate on the environment, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> pushed its proposal for a `` planet protection fund,'' which it first put forward at a summit of the Non-Aligned Nations in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, last month. The aim of the fund would be to `` bring within the easy reach of all countries, developed and developing, the technologies to combat pollution and environmental degradation,'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s statement said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said leaders divided into three groups: those who want a fund set up now; those who oppose the fund; and those who support leaving open the possibility of a fund in the future. `` The developing countries tend to say, ` You must pay,' and the developed countries say, ` We are not going to pay,''' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> told a news conference. Earlier, the summit host, <LOCATION> Malayasian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON>, complained that developing countries were to blame for pollution. But <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told reporters, `` I think they agreed, developed and developing, that we are all polluters, each in our own way.''

<TEXT>
 Planned Parenthood Federation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has announced the creation of a political arm that will lobby legislators against abortion restrictions. Citing the recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling giving states more authority to regulate abortion issues, organization president <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON> announced the formation of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund at a news conference Thursday opening the group's 66th annual meeting. `` The <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> decision put women's access to abortion in grave danger,'' <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> left us with no other choice but to become even more politically aggressive than we had been before to ensure that the right to choose abortion remains secure.'' The Action Fund's first-year budget of $ 1 million, which must be raised separately from Planned Parenthood's regular funds, will allow the national organization to expand its current lobbying and political campaign activities nationwide, <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON> said. Final tax status approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is expected in three to four months, she said. The change will not affect the existing organization, which will retain its tax-exempt status that limits its spending to $ 250,000 on grass-roots campaigns in individual states and $ 1 million nationally. Contributions to the new fund will not be tax deductible, but donations to the parent organization still will be. The fund's initial effort will be a newspaper advertising and direct-mail campaign targeting the voting records of at least a dozen congressmen Planned Parenthood feels are a threat to abortion rights, <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON> said. More than 1,200 delegates are attending the annual convention, which runs through Sunday. On the agenda is a debate among the organization's leadership regarding whether it will direct efforts toward a constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights. <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON> predicted a decision by Sunday. Also scheduled to make an appearance at the convention is Dr. <PERSON> Etienne-Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Baulieu </PERSON>, developer of the controversial abortion pill RU 486, who will receive a scientific research award from the organization.

 <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, acting in the wake of attacks by blacks on white and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> students, has canceled two social events for tonight that would have been attended mainly by black students. The school canceled Funk Night and a dance sponsored by <PERSON> Omega </PERSON> <PERSON> Psi </PERSON> <PERSON> Phi </PERSON>, a black fraternity, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichley </PERSON>, vice president for university relations. He would not explain why officials canceled those events and not others during the annual Parents' Weekend at the <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> school. `` Our intention is not to make every move public,'' he said Thursday. <PERSON> Reichley </PERSON> said the university wants to make sure campus social events are retricted to students so they are easier to supervise. There have been 19 reports of assaults or robberies on 22 students since classes began in September. At least 14 incidents were assaults on white and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> male students, who described their attackers as black teen-agers who did not appear to be students, <PERSON> Reichley </PERSON> said. Campus and <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> police have increased security efforts and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> President <PERSON> Vartan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorian </PERSON>, in a statement this week, said he might ask for unspecified federal help.

 A federal report says four <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jets flew through a dangerous wind shear at <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> last year when pilots either did not hear or misunderstood a control tower warning. The report released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said one jet canceled its approach, but four others went through and eventually landed safely. `` Four commercial airline pilots from one airline flew into microburst activity, despite prior warning by the controllers and explicit airline policy to avoid microburst alert areas,'' the report said. `` The crews either did not hear clearly or did not know the meaning of the term ` microburst alert.''' A microburst is produced when a downdraft of heavy air hits the earth and causes winds to spread horizontally along the ground. A plane going through one experiences a head wind, then a downdraft, and finally a tailwind, which can cause a crash. The <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> microburst pushed winds in opposite directions at 92 miles an hour, officials said. `` They were lucky,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a researcher with the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, who has helped conduct tests on the radar detecting the wind shifts. None of the four pilots who landed during the incident could remember getting the alert, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, who was staff engineer with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s flight training center in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> at the time. `` They flat did n't remember it. ... It was no wonder they did n't hear it That's a very, very busy time for pilots,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> recommended in its report that controllers be required to reroute air traffic when microbursts are detected, even if pilots think it's safe.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> embraced Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> today and urged his countryman to continue down the path of reform. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> took office on Aug. 24 to become the first non-Communist leader of a Soviet bloc nation. He thanked the pope for supporting <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s opposition movement `` during the difficult years'' of government oppression. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic intellectual and old acquaintance of the pope, made <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> his first foreign visit since his appointment as prime minister. The pope called the 20-minute meeting `` historic.'' In an emotional reunion, the two-men embraced outside the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s private library, the site of the closed-door talks <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> told an aide there was no need for introductions. Later, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said the meeting was the `` crowning, the fruit of the dialogue, of which today we see the results.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> turned toward a Polish television crew and responded in Polish, ` We hope there's no turning back.'' `` This is not possible,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Krzystof </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubiszewski </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in June 1979, eight months after his election to the papacy, helped spark demands for democracy that led to the formation of Solidarity, the first non-Communist labor movement in the Soviet bloc. During the dark years following the martial law crackdown of 1981, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> helped keep the Solidarity spirit alive, including making a return to his homeland in 1983. The church, which has historically played a pivotal role in the overwhelmingly Catholic country, took part in the long negotiations that led to elections this year and approval of a 24-member Cabinet that includes 12 Solidarity members and four Communists. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> quoted some words from the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> t emphasize that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> had acted not only as a Pole but as head of the worldwide <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` If I did something, I did it as part of my universal mission and it should be viewed as such,'' the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> quoted the pope as telling <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. `` I consider this audience an historic and positive fact. However, it is not historic for me only under a patriotic profile ...'' As evidence of the changes sweeping the Soviet-bloc, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> on Friday ordained as bishops the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s first ambassador to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since the Communists broke diplomatic relations after World War II and the first Roman Catholic bishop in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> in 60 years. Aides said <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, long a Solidarity adviser, and the pope have met about 20 times during <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s 11-year pontificate, most recently when Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in April.

<HEAD>Mexican Drug Cartel Reportedly Slays 4 Jehovah's Witnesses By Mistake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witness missionaries who disappeared while preaching door-to-door in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> five years ago apparently were slain by drug smugglers who mistook them for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents, a published report says. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> linked the slayings of the two married couples to the drug cartel implicated in the torture-killing of <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, 32, and his wife, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mascarenas </PERSON>, 29, and his wife, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, 27, of Ely, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, are thought to have been killed in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, on Dec. 2, 1984, the newspaper reported. The couples were believed to be following the religion's well-known practice of preaching door-to-door, working in an upper-class <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> neighborhood, before they disappeared, the newspaper said They apparently `` went to the wrong house,'' the newspaper quoted a source as saying. `` They were suspected of being <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents.'' Federal investigators believed the couples were buried in the same <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> park where <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> initially was buried, the report said. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> disappeared in February 1985; his body and that of his pilot were found a month later buried on a ranch outside <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>. The bodies of the missionaries have not been found. Federal authorities have indicted several members of an alleged drug cartel in the <LOCATION> Camarena </LOCATION> slaying, including reputed kingpin <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, who is in custody in a Mexican prison. Last week, <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> and 11 others also were indicted in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in connection with the slayings of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens one month before the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> killing. Authorities believe they, like the missionaries, were killed in a case of mistaken identity because drug lords thought they were <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents. The Times quoted sources as saying that charges may never be brought against the suspects in the missionary slayings because the evidence is largely circumstantial.

<TEXT>
 The lowly spud never had it so good. A bunch of potatoes from <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and faraway <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> was gussied up and served at a gourmet, seven-course luncheon Thursday by the Watergate's renowned French chef, <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palladin </PERSON>. They were shredded, diced, pureed, baked, fried, simmered, glazed and dunked in rich cream sauces by <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> and his staff. Then they were escorted out of the kitchen by tuxedo-clad waiters under the bright glare of camera lights, to the oohs and aahs of a half-dozen diners. The all-potato menu was prepared for the benefit of a Japanese television crew that is touring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> filming a half-hour history of the potato chip, which was supposed to have been invented in <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, in 1853. To give the visiting Japanese an idea of the potato's versatility, <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> was asked to prepare a dream lunch featuring nothing but potato dishes He happily obliged. `` I was raised all my life with potatoes,'' he said. <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> began with tiny potato pancakes containing smoked salmon and topped with caviar, followed by a cream soup of purple Chilean potatoes with <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> potato dumplings and purple potato chips. Next came Icelandic langoustines wrapped in fried, shredded potatoes in a ginger sauce. His piece de resistance, especially created for the lunch, was a risotto of finely diced white rose potatoes from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and poached <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> scallops in squid ink, covered with shavings of parmesan cheese and fresh white truffles that cost $ 720 a pound. After cannelloni of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> potatoes stuffed with wild mushrooms and goose liver pate in a tomato sauce, and breasts of wild <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> doves with pureed Red Yukon potatoes from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and red wine gravy, the dessert was a sweet potato sorbet with tiny potato pastries. <PERSON> Tani </PERSON> <PERSON> Kei </PERSON>, the host of the TV show, sighed contentedly as he finished with an espresso. A popular entertainer in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> who took his stage name from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tani </PERSON> <PERSON> Kei </PERSON> said his favorite potato dishes back home are less fancy and more robust. He likes his potatoes boiled, baked or simmered with chunks of beef, soy sauce, sugar and sweetd enough rice. But <PERSON> Fujiyoshi </PERSON> said the postwar generation of Japanese are crazy about potatoes, especially French fries and chips. He said potato chips, which account for more than $ 700 million in annual sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, once came in three dozen flavors _ from hot chili sauce and shrimp to onion and carrots. `` Now we are beginning to like the Americans' plain, salted potato chips,'' <PERSON> Fujiyoshi </PERSON> said. `` But we have no dips, not yet.''

 Rescuers plucked a baby from a sinking car ditched in a creek by a man who had assaulted the infant's mother, police said. `` The water was coming up to the baby's chest and it was still rising,'' said police officer T.L. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. `` If he had not been in the child seat, I am more than convinced he would have drowned.'' Officers were heading for the scene of an accident involving a stolen car early Thursday when they found the automobile in a rain-swollen creek and the baby inside. In the predawn darkness, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> reached into the back seat, which was two-thirds full of water, and pulled out the 9-month-old boy. The infant's mother, <ORGANIZATION> Felichia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, reported she was assaulted as she talked on a pay phone. The man threatened her with a gun and tried to drag her behind a convenience store, but she managed to grab a bottle from atop an ice machine and hit him in the head, police said. She broke free and ran to a nearby house and called police. When she went back outside, she discovered her car was gone _ with her son, <PERSON> Tirone </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peace </PERSON>, in the back seat. No arrests have been made, police said.

 <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Freiburger </PERSON> kept thinking she was n't ready to die as she struggled to escape a car wedged in a gap between the collapsed upper deck of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> and the split lower deck As she fumbled with her seat belt and climbed across the driver's seat, <PERSON> Freiburger </PERSON> hoped her movements would not tip the crushed car into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Freiburger, helped to safety, suffered a cracked breastbone, cracked spine and cracked collarbone in the wreck. The impact of the accident left her a quarter-inch shorter, doctors said. From her hospital bed Thursday, she said she felt `` very sore but very lucky. Happy to be here.'' She and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>, the driver of the gray 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, marveled that they were the only ones on that section of bridge as it collapsed in Tuesday's rush-hour earthquake. A small red car seen flying over the edge in a home video tape shown on national television this week arrived minutes later, after most traffic had managed to stop. The driver was killed. <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>'s car crumpled like tin, and he ca n't explain why it did n't plunge into the bay. `` The ground just opened up and the car started going down,'' he said. `` All I could think is ` I'm going through the bridge and into the bay.' ... I knew it was death. I did n't think there was anything that could stop us.'' At his apartment in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> said he was searching for reasons why he survived the unthinkable with no more than a sore neck. Maybe, he said, he will get a chance to save someone else. `` It seems like it should be more profound. It was kind of a brush with death, but I do n't feel that much different,'' said the 33-year-old. He and Freiburger, 41, of <LOCATION> Larkspur </LOCATION>, work at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> real estate company. They were returning from a project in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> when they were caught on the bridge. `` I'll live with the aches and pains of bruises and just be thankful I'm here,'' said <PERSON> Freiburger </PERSON>, who may be released early next week. `` It all happened in just split seconds,'' she recalled. `` First there was a moment of utter silence and then boom, an explosion-type of noise. It all opened up. We went traveling down like a roller coaster ride, just that fast.'' <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> thought at first that he had four flat tires. When the bridge began bouncing and weaving, he knew it was an earthquake. `` I closed my eyes real tight and made my mind blank,'' he said. `` You know how you're supposed to have all those flashbacks and your whole life flashes before your eyes? That did n't happen. ... I told <PERSON> Janice </PERSON>, ` We're going to die,' and she said, ` No, we're not. Hold on.''' When the car slammed to a stop, <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> climbed out the window and onto the hood of the car. Propelled by fear, he reached overhead and hoisted himself up onto the surface of the bridge's lower deck Despite her injuries, <PERSON> Freiburger </PERSON> was able to scramble out of the car and onto the hood. <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> and a stranger pulled her to safety. She immediately started walking toward <LOCATION> Treasure </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` Everyone said, ` This is amazing,''' recalled <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>, describing the rush-hour crowd of drivers on the lower deck of the bridge. `` But since we were n't bleeding, everyone pretty much wanted to get off the bridge themselves.'' It was more than a mile to <LOCATION> Treasure </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Freiburger </PERSON> was having trouble breathing, but the pair kept walking. `` I was in a great deal of pain and I just knew that I was going to make it,'' <PERSON> Freiburger </PERSON> said. After preliminary treatment at a clinic, the two were taken by ambulance to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Neither <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> nor Freiburger is eager to cross the bridge when it reopens. `` When the ground drops out from underneath you, it's kind of hard to trust anything,'' he said. Vowing to try it eventually, <PERSON> Freiburger </PERSON> conceded the return trip may be a long way off. `` I'm certain I will never cross any bridge without some anxiety,'' she said. `` But it's something I will have to work with. When you live in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, there are a lot of bridges.''

 <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s judges and other court workers returned to work today after failing in a three-day strike to force the government to protect them from drug traffickers. `` We are certain that more of us will be murdered in coming months, but we ca n't shut down the court system for very long,'' said <PERSON> Consuelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, a federal judge and member of the court workers' union, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>. The 5,000 judges and 12,000 other judicial workers walked off the job Tuesday after a federal judge was slain by drug dealers in retaliation for the extradition of drug suspects to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Since 1981, about 50 judges and 170 other judicial employees have been killed in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> says 1,600 of the 5,000 judges have been threatened with death in the last 12 months. Ms. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said union workers are prepared to strike again the next time a judge or court worker is murdered by drug traffickers. `` The next strike will be longer and the next one longer still,'' she said. `` We will continue to call strikes as long as we are being killed and the government continues to do nothing.'' Ms. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said Justice Minister <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Manrique </PERSON> told union members in a meeting Tuesday that the government lacks the resources to increase protection for judges. She said none of the $ 19 million in aid promised by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to protect <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> judges has arrived in the country. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> published an account of yet another attempt by the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel to begin talks with officials on ending the government crackdown on the drug trade. An unidentified <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> lawyer representing the cartel spoke two weeks ago with the country's leading leftist, <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaramillo </PERSON>, a candidate in March presidential elections, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Jaramillo </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Jaramillo </PERSON> was quoted as telling the lawyer that he favors dialogue with the traffickers but not while the traffickers are setting off bombs and killing people. The <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel has made several contacts with government officials and other politicians in attempts to negotiate a truce in the 2-month-old war on drugs. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has said there will be no talks and no truce. Barco resumed extraditions to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Aug. 18 following the slayings of a leading presidential candidate, a federal judge, and a police colonel by drug barons. But the traffickers have struck back with a terror campaign that has included more than 160 bombings and the assassinations of eight news industry workers. The government on Thursday pressed ahead in its anti-drug offensive by arresting two drug suspects, one the alleged personal pilot of the presumed head of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>. The pilot, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuesta </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, is wanted on federal charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, national police Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmona </PERSON> said in a news release. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuesta </PERSON>, arrested in a raid on a north <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> apartment, is wanted on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and will be held for extradition, <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmona </PERSON> said.

 Two Palestinians suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were stabbed to death today by fellow <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>, and one body was wheeled around the streets of a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city as a warning to others, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Government officials said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> telephoned Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> Thursday to try to get the stalled <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process restarted. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> publicly criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals that he fears are aimed at pressuring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has offered to sign a `` memorandum of understanding'' to rule out any <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> involvement in preliminary peace talks. Israeli officials declined comment. Arab reporters said 24-year-old <PERSON> Taher </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> was stabbed to death in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Shortly after dawn, they said, masked Palestinians pushed the corpse in a cart through <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' central market before dumping it on the street. The death was blamed on the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION>, one of two Arab gangs reportedly active in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> against suspected collaborators. The second killing occurred in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Breij refugee camp. Arab reporters said <PERSON> Harb </PERSON> <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Essa </PERSON>, 43, was attacked in his home by masked Palestinians. He was suspected of having ties with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, they said. <PERSON> Essa </PERSON> was dead on arrival at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and doctors said his throat was cut. The army confirmed the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> killing and said it was checking the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> case. The deaths raised to 132 the number of Palestinians killed by fellow Arabs in the 22-month uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and civilians have killed 596 Palestinians, and 40 Israelis have been slain. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s call to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> followed three other recent contacts: <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s call to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday, a phone conversation Wednesday between Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, and a letter Thursday from <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. All appeared aimed at easing tension created by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> Tuesday, when he warned members of his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc of `` a tense period with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He later told a political rally that `` The stone-throwers, the fire-bombers have not succeeded in driving us into the arms of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. It is not possible that when they fail to do this, others by diplomatic means ... would try to bring us to meetings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' The comments were seen as slaps at <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION>, who has put forward a proposal designed to get <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to accept an invitation from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> for preliminary talks with Palestinians. Today, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that in the latest phone conversation <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> discussed how to move ahead on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s peace plan, which calls for elections in the occupied lands as a first step toward limited autonomy. The <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> report said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has offered to prepare a `` memorandum of understanding'' that would cover <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s main objections to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s plan. The memorandum, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, would rule out involvement by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and restrict preliminary talks to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s proposed elections in the territories. It quoted unnamed government sources as saying <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was `` not inclined to accept the administration's offer in its present form.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in mid-November to discuss the peace process.

 A man described as having an ankle fetish pleaded guilty to kidnapping a Bible student in a nine-hour ordeal in which prosecutors said he tried to cut off her feet and eat her flesh during a satanic ritual. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON>, 38, entered his plea Thursday as his trial was about to begin and after prosecutors agreed to drop charges of attempted murder and first-degree assault. <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> admitted during court proceedings to abducting the woman Nov. 13.

Two months later, he lured an 18-year-old woman to the church parking lot, clubbed her over the head, put her in the trunk and drove to a park in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. He tried to kill the woman as a sacrifice to Satan, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Opposition Figure Says Give Krenz a Chance</HEAD>

``It doesn't...''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An East German opposition figure said people have been too quick to condemn the country's new leader and he urged citizens to give the reputed hard-liner a chance to institute reforms, a newspaper said today. On his first full day as head of the country, <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday chatted with factory workers in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and portrayed himself as open to dialogue and change. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> also met with a church leader and opened the way for a new law regulating foreign travel. The image of the active leader engaged in frank discussion with workers contrasted sharply with the stiff, reclusive manner of <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, who was removed Wednesday after 18 years in power. Opposition groups say the new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief's politics differ little from those of his autocratic predecessor. More than 10,000 people demanding change rallied in the city of <LOCATION> Zittau </LOCATION>, in southeastern <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, on Thursday night, said activists from the New Forum pro-democracy group. But <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Henrich </PERSON>, a New Forum member, was quoted today as saying <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> should be given time to change people's minds. `` It does n't make sense to deny him a chance from the very start,'' <PERSON> Henrich </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the West German newspaper <PERSON> Badische </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON>. He said Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was also once a supporter of the `` party apparatus.'' `` And look how excited we all are about what's he doing now,'' <PERSON> Henrich </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, 52, faces the most serious threat to orthodox Communist rule in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 40-year history, as tens of thousands flee to the West and thousands of others who do not wish to leave agitate for a more open society. He already has said the party will resist the democratic reforms under way in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Nonetheless, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network said his meeting with factory workers would have been `` unthinkable only a few weeks ago.'' The broadly publicized meetings appeared aimed at showing the country's 16.5 million people that <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> will deliver on his pledge to address <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s problems as long as the party's leading role remains intact. When asked by <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> why so many co-workers fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, metal worker <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Berus </PERSON> said, `` A lot of things kept adding up until some people felt there was no alternative.'' `` Until last week, you could n't talk about problems, and people just got fed up,'' he said. Several workers complained of rigid travel restrictions to the West, which were recently expanded to bar travel to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> without government permission. Thousands of East Germans have made their way to the West through those countries in recent weeks. In one of his first official acts in office, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said the government is drafting a new law that could ultimately ease travel abroad. He said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s refusal to recognize East German citizenship is an obstacle. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> grants East Germans automatic citizenship. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lueder </PERSON>, a member of West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s ruling coalition, today was quoted as saying <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> could help expand travel by allowing East Germans to change money for West German marks. East German currency is not convertible. <PERSON> Lueder </PERSON> was quoted in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Cologne </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> newspaper as saying the move would be a `` subsidized exchange.'' He suggested <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> could use the new East German marks to buy more goods from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In addition to talking with factory workers, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday met with <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Leich </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, for talks described by East German television as `` open and constructive.'' The church has been at the forefront of reform efforts. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> said in his first national address as party leader that he has no intention of sharing power with opposition groups. Nevertheless, New Forum activists said Thursday that local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION> offered to open limited talks with them.

 Protesters clashed with the bodyguards of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> during a rally today outside the federal <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building. The anti-military service group `` Action for Total Refusal'' was protesting federal efforts to force a convicted draft dodger to serve jail time in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Federal officials are trying to extradite <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to begin serving a five-month sentence for refusing both mandatory military service and the alternative <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> option for those opposed to violence. West German residents of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> are not subject to the compulsory service law because of the city's status under Allied control. About 10 demonstrators, protesting illegally on the Parliament grounds, startled <PERSON> Momper </PERSON>'s security detachment when they abruptly unfurled a banner that had been hidden in a bouquet of flowers the demonstrators tried to press on Momper. One of the protesters wore a rubber mask of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on the back of his head and had his coat on backwards as well, creating the impression he had his back to <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> when he leaped forward to unfurl the banner. Startled security men wrestled the masked protester to the ground, and others engaged in brief skirmishes with demonstrators to separate them from Momper's party. <PERSON> Momper </PERSON>, a member of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, had been asked by the anti-military service group to reject the extradition request. He was at the federal <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building today to be inaugurated as president of the Bundesrat, the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Demonstrations are forbidden on the West German Parliament grounds, but no arrests were made following the incident early Friday. <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> was a resident of <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION> state when he reached the military service age. He is in hiding in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, where authorities have been asked to find him and return him to <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION> to serve his term.

 Thousands of residents in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> woke up to no electricity today after winter's surprise attack on autumn a day earlier that dumped up to 6 inches of snow over the region. Snow was still falling this morning in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. By midmorning 8.5 inches had fallen in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> in a 24-hour period. Southern states also were caught off-guard by unseasonable cold; <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> officials were barraged with phone calls from homeless people seeking shelter. Two deaths were attributed to the storm, which set records throughout the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> for earliest measurable snowfall when it arrived Thursday. A firefighter in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> was electrocuted by a downed power line and a <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> man was killed when his car skidded and hit a pickup truck on a snow-slickened road near <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>. More than 200,000 utility customers had been without service late Thursday in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, but by daybreak power had been restored to all but 51,000. Utility spokesmen said the blackouts were far more widespread than they would have been if the storm struck later in the season because most trees still had their foliage. The leaves trapped the wet, heavy snow until branches snapped from the weight, downing power lines. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> power crews worked through the night to repair downed lines, but 29,000 customers in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> were still without power by midmorning. <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> set up an overnight shelter for people without heat in their homes. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said about 25 people stayed there Thursday night, and the center was kept open today. The winter preview followed a weekend of unusually balmy weather with temperatures in the 70s and low 80s in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` Do n't put your spring coat away,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` We had Indian summer last week and now this, and we'll have Indian summer next week.'' About 17,500 people were still without power today in southern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, mostly in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area. Four to 6 inches of snow was reported early today in <LOCATION> Gaylord </LOCATION>, in the northern <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, which got 6 inches of snow in the southeastern part of the state, 5,000 utility customers were without power as of sunrise, said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Six inches of snow fell in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> in the 24-hour period that ended at 7 a.m. today The previous record for the whole month of October in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> was 4 inches, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Northern Illinois received about 5.3 inches of snow over the past 24 hours, but because of temperatures that hovered slightly above freezing, only about 2.5 inches remained on the ground today, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecaster <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` There's precipitation over much of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. ... Every reporting station is reporting snow. In southern parts, rain is mixed with snow,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Light snow fell in the mountains of northern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> today and a freeze warning was issued for the entire state for tonight. <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, had a record low temperature of 34 early today, breaking the mark of 35 set in 1981. Emergency overflow shelters were opened in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Thursday, bringing calls from people looking for a warm place to sleep. Most winter volunteer shelters do not open until Nov. 1. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, shelter coordinator for Task Force for the Homeless, said, `` Everywhere I called was at maximum capacity, but everybody was able to get somewhere out of the night, so I felt pretty good.'' The chill penetrated even <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> managed to set two records within 18 hours _ a high of 92 Thursday and a low of 56 this morning. Elsewhere in the state today, <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> bottomed out at 34, <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> chilled to 35, <LOCATION> Apalachicola </LOCATION> was n't far behind at 42, <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> hit 44 and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> dropped to 46 _ all records for the date.

 <ORGANIZATION> Nine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members were arrested and charged in a series of bombings at a mine where a strike has been under way for five years. The miners arrested Thursday were accused in two bombings, an attempted bombing and a fire that did $ 400,000 damage at <LOCATION> Milburn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colliery </LOCATION>, where 45 union members went on strike in October 1984. Authorities planned to seek indictments next week before a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>. One miner, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>, was charged with destroying property involved in interstate commerce, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. He faces 10 years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines if convicted. Eight others were charged with conspiracy to use explosives and faces up to five years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines. All nine were arraigned before a federal magistrate in <LOCATION> Bluefield </LOCATION> and freed on $ 10,000 bond. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>, said the union was unaware of any evidence implicating the nine. `` In any strike situation, there are many allegations and accusations that turn out not to be true,'' he said. In June, not long after the mine's owners hired a new company to operate the mine, a bomb was set off at a bridge entrance, and in July a fire resulted in about $ 400,000 damage, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. Then last month, a bomb caused about $ 35,000 damage to a mine ventilation system, and authorities disarmed a 57-pound time bomb before it exploded, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. No one was injured in the incidents. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said the investigation is continuing, but would not comment on whether further arrests are expected.

 An Irishman cleared by an appeals court of a 14-year-old terrorist bombing was freed on bail today pending his appeal of a separate murder conviction. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s release by a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> court meant all the so-called <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> Four are now free after a long fight for exoneration. The four were serving life sentences for two <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bombings that killed five people in 1974 in <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> judge overturned the convictions Thursday, ruling that police officers probably lied to get the four convictions. The government immediately ordered an inquiry into alleged police misconduct. While three of the four were freed Thursday, 35-year-old <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was also serving a life sentence for the murder of a British soldier, and he was flown to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> to begin an appeal. He was freed today on $ 6,500 bail and emerged from the court to cheers from friends and relatives, including his 14-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Cara </PERSON>. `` I am very happy,'' he replied to a reporter's question. `` How do you think I feel after 14 years of hell?'' Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, the Cabinet member responsible for police, said in a BBC-TV interview Thursday night that the <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> case was `` a blow for the whole system'' of criminal justice in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, deputy chief constable of the <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> police force, whose officers handled the original investigation of the <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> Four, said Thursday that three officers had been suspended from duty pending the inquiry by retired appeals judge Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> identified them as a sergeant and two constables. He said a fourth officer involved, a detective inspector, had died and a fifth, a detective chief inspector, had retired. The ruling ended years of work by relatives, former government officials, church leaders and journalists to overturn the verdict. The sentence had been upheld in 1977 even though <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members made detailed confessions in the case. The appeals court threw out the convictions of <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, 35, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, 39, and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, all of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, in the bombing of two pubs at <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION> on Oct. 5, 1974. The convictions of <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> for a pub bombing in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Woolwich </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 6, 1974, also were reversed. Two people died in that attack.

<TEXT>
 In `` Dangerous Games,'' the collective title of two dance theater pieces created by <PERSON> Graciela </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>, the theme is domination, primarily sexual and political, done to a tango beat. In `` Tango,'' two sinister, working-class brothers violate and then fight over a young prostitute; in `` Orfeo,'' a reworking of the Orpheus legend, the hero seeks to rescue his love from the Argentine secret police who operate out of a place not unlike Hades. All of this, which arrived at Broadway's Nederlander Theater on Thursday, is not as interesting as it might sound, even though the evening contains some haunting tango music by <PERSON> Astor </PERSON> <PERSON> Piazzolla </PERSON>. The dancing is a tad pretentious and a bit silly, particularly when it's trying to be sexy. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>'s choreography is filled with steamy clinches, erotic posturing and a heavy dose of whips and leather. It's light years from the romantic duets that were the main attraction of a different kind of tango entertainment, `` Tango Argentino,'' a mild Broadway success several seasons ago. `` Tango'' is the earthy, simple and more successful of <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>'s two dances The two brothers -LRB- <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineo </PERSON> -RRB- are violent, narcissistic men, stereotypes of the macho Latin tradition. They fight, strut and then take whatever they want, particularly the new woman in the bordello -LRB- <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> -RRB-. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is not only a fine dancer but she's an actress, too, making the woman's brutalization all the more convincing. In the end, she is the most poignant victim, transformed into someone as hard and as uncaring as the men who used her. In `` Orfeo,'' <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> reaches for political significance and falls short. The piece is dedicated to the `` desaparecidos,'' the Spanish word for all those who were arrested and then disappeared during the brutal Argentine military dictatorship. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>'s Orfeo -LRB- <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, again -RRB- is a gaucho who sees his love -LRB- <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Caballos </PERSON> -RRB- spirited away by <PERSON> Pluton </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ard </PERSON> -RRB-, who wears military fatigues and a beret. <PERSON> Ard </PERSON> is an athletic dancer who projects an unnerving menace. But he's also saddled with some of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>'s worst lyrics, particularly when he sings about `` the joys of torture.'' The lyrics seem to be an intrusion on the evening and could have been cut with little harm to both pieces. The choreography ca n't support the weight of <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>'s political message.

<TEXT>
 The voice of <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> thundered through Westminster Abbey today as 2,000 guests, including most of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s greatest actors, paid homage to the late giant of stage and screen. The recorded excerpt of <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s speech to the troops in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> V'' was the highlight of a service honoring <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>. `` There may be imitators, but there is no second <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>. He was unique,'' Sir <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON>, said in the eulogy. Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON>, 85, recited from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donne </PERSON>'s Holy Sonnet, delivering its opening line in a gravelly whisper: `` Death be not proud ...'' <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> recited from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Milton </PERSON>'s `` Lycidas,'' and Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> read passages from the Bible. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, as he was known after his 1970 ennoblement, died on July 11 at age 82 and was buried at a small family funeral in southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. His ashes will be laid finally to rest next year in <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abbey </LOCATION>. Although it marked a death, the nationally televised service was alive with triumphal music swelling through the cavernous abbey, and there were occasional chuckles as Guinness remembered some of the lighter moments of <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s life. Leading the congregation was <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s widow, the actress <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Plowright </PERSON>. Also present was Prince <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s youngest son and an aspiring actor Deputy Prime Minister Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> represented the government. Other actors present included <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>, and Italian film director <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeffirelli </PERSON>. Guinness, 75, said <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> `` stands alongside the acknowledged great ...'' `` Even allowing for violent changes of fashion, I feel that each of those tremendous actors of the past would have recognized his style, applauded him and welcomed him as one of their own.'' `` Great,'' a much-abused word, readily applied to <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Perhaps it consists of a happy combination of imagination, physical magnetism, a commanding and appealing voice, an expressive eye -- and danger.'' He singled out <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s 1946 performance of `` King <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>,'' when `` He spoke with the utmost simplicity, the speech which begins ` I'll pray, and then I'll sleep'. `` He knelt, center-stage, facing the audience, and made no movement. He created an awful stillness ...'' <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> summed up <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> as `` Ambitious, determined, brave and daring. A full life, lived generously and shared with all of us. He has, I am sure, the nation's gratitude.'' He concluded with two famous lines from Hamlet: `` Good night, sweet prince, `` And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.''

 Many hunters get hurt simply by falling out of trees, not by being shot by other hunters, federal health researchers said. The Centers for Disease Control, which studies injuries as well as disease, reported Thursday the results of a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> study showing that 36 percent of hunting injuries involved tree stands _ the perches where deer hunters wait for prey. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> officials studied 594 deer hunting-related injuries in the state over the 1979-89 hunting seasons: 214 involved tree stands, which may be hastily built platforms or store-bought tree chairs. Seventeen people died, fractures were common and several teen-age hunters suffered neck fractures and were paralyzed. `` This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, an epidemiologist with the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. `` The nature of the system is such that the only reports we get are the ones that are fairly serious.'' He added: `` We're sure this is occurring in other states. But no one had systematically looked into it.'' When most people hear of hunting accidents, they picture one person shooting another, said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s state hunter-safety coordinator. But in recent years, he said, more than 50 percent have involved tree stands. `` It's a serious problem,'' he said. Most of the tree stand injuries involved falls; 111 hunters were hurt when they tumbled out of their stands, 49 fell while trying to climb down and 40 fell while trying to climb up. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said the average stand was 16 feet above the ground. Twenty-seven injuries _ and eight of the 17 tree stand fatalities _ occurred when weapons went off accidentally, either while firearms were being carried up and down the tree or on impact from a fall. Sixty-one of the 214 tree stand mishaps involved mechanical failure, as the stand or its steps collapsed under the hunter's weight Eleven hunters reported they had fallen asleep just before falling out. Eight hunters either admitted they were drunk or were suspected of it by game officials. That number, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said, might be low. `` We could not assess the influence of alcohol or other substance abuse. ... Most of these hunters did not have blood-alcohol levels taken,'' he said. While some hunters simply lost their balance, some suffered bizarre accidents. A law enforcement officer chopped down small trees surrounding his stand to improve his view of the deer. He fell from his stand onto the jagged tree stumps and was severely injured, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Another hunter, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, climbed a tree in a pond, not knowing the tree had been killed by beavers. The tree broke in two and the hunter was killed when he tumbled out and the tree fell on top of him. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said a woman was hurt when she shot a deer from her tree perch and the wounded animal charged. The impact from the deer crashing into the tree dislodged her and she broke a leg in the fall. Some of the injured hunters were asked whether they had taken a hunting safety course; two-thirds had n't. And none of the 214 injured hunters was wearing a safety harnesses or seat belt. Many mishaps could have been prevented, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, if hunters had used safety harnesses, unloaded their guns while climbing up and down, used pull-up cords to hoist their weapons into their stands and checked the condition of their stands before climbing in.

<TEXT>
 Parliament, meeting to move <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> closer to democracy, voted today to disband a militia that was created to protect the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after the 1956 revolt. The legislature also approved proposals to rehabilitate victims of political trials during <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s years of Communist oppression. The decision to disband the militia came just three days before the 33rd anniversary of the 1956 revolt, which was crushed by Soviet tanks. The bill had been opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which assumed power after the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was formally dismantled Oct. 7. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which professes democratic ideals but remains in sole possession of power at least until parliamentary elections next year, had suggested disarming the force but keeping it as a civil defense organization. `` The existence of the Workers Militia ... is no longer justified,'' declared <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Borics </PERSON> in introducing legislation to dissolve the 60,000-strong force. Of votes cast on the issue, 274 were in favor of termination, with six against and 30 abstentions. Parliament already rehabilitated revolutionary leader <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and his leading associates earlier in the year. Parliament had already rehabilitated revolutionary leader <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and his leading associates earlier in the year, but the bill passed today was broader, extending to all those convicted of revolutionary activity during the a956 uprising. The bill, which also pledged unspecified compensation to victims, was approved by 278 legislators, with four against 26 abstentions. A similar but separate bill also formally rehabilitated those victimized between 1948 and 1962 _ the period now officially considered <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Stalinist period. Parliament has been meeting in a historic session aimed at removing the vestiges of 41 years of Communist rule. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation permitting opposition parties to compete in the first free national elections since 1948. Lawmakers still must settle a dispute over when to select a new president. A proposal agreed on by the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and most major opposition parties suggested that voters cast ballots on Nov. 26, with subsequent heads of state appointed by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. But some opposition groups fear the ruling party would have too strong an advantage if the president were chosen next month. They have collected nearly 200,000 signatures calling for a referendum on whether the president should be chosen now or only after national elections redistribute political power. Parliament is to try and sort out the issue at its next session, beginning Oct. 31.

 Three Hill <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> security policemen have been arrested in a federal `` sting'' operation that uncovered thefts and illegal sales of military property, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>, 27, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, 21, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, 23, were arrested without incident Wednesday by agents of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> of Special Investigations. They were charged with theft of government property. The arrests were part of Operation Punchout, a three-year undercover investigation that prosecutors say eventually could result in charges against more than 100 people. The three were among nine people charged in sealed indictments that were handed up Oct. 13 by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION>. An additional 12 persons were charged earlier in a separate sealed indictment handed up in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In the undercover operation, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents posed as operators of a mock military surplus store in the town of <LOCATION> Roy </LOCATION>, 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. They netted an assortment of government munitions and equipment, including three F-16 jet engines.

<HEAD>Nuns' Chickens Slaughtered by Government Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAVENTRY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ministry of Agriculture officials Friday began slaughtering 5,000 salmonella-infected chickens owned by a group of nuns who previously had locked themselves in their coop to protect their flock. The 13 nuns offered no resistance when the officials arrived at the Our Lady of Passion Monastery 70 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to carry out a task they tried to start two weeks ago. The ministry officials, accompanied by a government-appointed veterinarian, were led into the hen house by grim-faced nuns. The hens' necks were wrung and the carcasses were put in cardboard boxes that were loaded onto trucks for deliver to a dump site. During the slaughter, about six animal rights protesters demonstrated outside the convent, holding a banner that said: `` 5,000 killed today, 45 million killed every year _ Do n't support factory farming.'' The nuns, led by a Kentucky-born mother superior, Sister <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>, had gone to court seeking to overturn the ministry's ruling that their eggs were a serious health risk, but did not succeed Two weeks ago, they locked themselves in the henhouse for three hours to prevent the slaughter from being carried out. The nuns were to receive some compensation from the government but it was likely to be only a fraction of the $ 95,400 they say they need to finance a new venture, making luxury chocolates. Sister <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> said the order would survive, although it has lost its livelihood. `` The first thing I am going to do is buy a crystal ball,'' she joked. `` At this moment I just do n't know what we are going to do.''

Some parents carried toddlers while other Vietnamese carried huge `` boom box'' cassette players. `` We believe that voluntary repatriation works,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee office in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` The number of people applying has increased substantially.'' She said that since the voluntary repatriation program started in mid-1988, the number of Vietnamese applying to go home has increased from about 30 a month to about 65 each week. But the number of Vietnamese volunteering to go home represents only a fraction of the nearly 44,000 boat people in the colony who have not been granted refugee status, and the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government says other measures are needed. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> officials maintain that boat people who are denied refugee status must be repatriated against their will if necessary, but <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has yet to accept such a program. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also has expressed opposition to forcible repatriation. The returning boat people are taken to their hometowns and monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee organization. `` So far, we have had no indication of any problems'' for the returning Vietnamese, Ms. <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> said on the tarmac of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> international airport. Boat people returning to their impoverished Communist homeland receive $ 50 for adults and $ 25 for children by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> organization. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government earlier accepted all Vietnamese boat people as refugees entitled to resettlement. But under a tough policy adopted in June 1988 to stem the rising tide of asylum-seekers, the government ruled out resettlement for new arrivals unless they could prove they were fleeing political persecution. The vast majority of the more than 44,000 boat people to arrive under the new policy will fail to receive refugee status. Nearly 12,700 Vietnamese still in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> camps arrived before June 1988 and are eligible for resettlement.

 Relatives who insist <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON> is still alive said Friday the search for the Swedish diplomat who vanished decades ago after saving thousands of Jews will continue in a prison next week. `` There is evidence that <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> had been at various periods between 1950 and 1980 in the prison of Vladimir'' about 75 miles from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Dardel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>'s half-brother. Soviet authorities say <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>, who is credited with saving tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> during World War II, died in another prison in 1947, two years after he was arrested in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on spying charges. The Soviet line on <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>'s death has not changed, <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Dardel </PERSON> told a news conference, but officials are cooperating with the relatives' search and suggested a trip to the <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> prison Monday to let them check its archives and cells themselves. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Dardel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>'s half-sister, <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagergren </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Oct. 14 for their officially approved trip. In an initial meeting, Soviet authorities presented them with <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>'s personal effects, including his blue diplomatic passport, which they said had just been found among sacks of such items at <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. They were also shown a copy of a death certificate that backs up the Soviet claim that <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON> died of heart failure in 1947. But <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Dardel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lagergren </PERSON> maintain their belief that <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>, who would be 77, is still alive. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Dardel </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> prison used to have a special section for foreigners and about 20 former prisoners have told Western investigators `` there was a Swede whose name varied'' but resembled <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>. He said he would travel to the prison and investigate its records, which go back to 1953, and the cells themselves, but that he did not expect to find <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON> there because the foreigners' section is gone <PERSON> Lagergren </PERSON> said it was moving just to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Lubyanka </LOCATION> prison, where <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON> was held `` You can imagine what it feels like to pass through the <LOCATION> Lubyanka </LOCATION> prison and think that <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> has been there beginning in 1945,'' she said. `` And that he was there for two years, not far away from the Swedish embassy, without being able to contact anybody outside prison. And we did n't know.'' Soviet authorities investigated the relatives' list of people who believed they had seen <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON> with `` remarkable quickness'' and resolved many points, but not all, <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Dardel </PERSON> said. A Soviet official who met with the <LOCATION> Wallenberg </LOCATION> relatives said Friday they would continue to be welcome to search for his traces, but they could not expect to find him alive. `` The Soviet side has confirmed that the fact of <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>'s death is irrevocable and nothing more can be done here,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Uspensky </PERSON> said

 Farmers mailed 8,400 sugar beets to President <PERSON> Jean-Pascal </PERSON> <PERSON> Delamuraz </PERSON> on Friday to protest the government's refusal to raise minimum prices for their products. <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Thevoz </PERSON>, president of one of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s two main producer associations, said every sugar beet farmer in the nation sent one of the vegetables to the federal building in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, the capital.

On Oct. 2, the government rejected beet farmers' demands for a 10 percent increase in prices to counter a bumper crop this year.

 Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., said Friday there is `` no basis whatsoever'' to a published report that he engaged in sexual misconduct in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gym and predicted that any ethics committee investigation would support his denial The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the ethics committee has evidence of sexual misconduct by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and several other members in the gym, located in the sub-basement of the <ORGANIZATION> Rayburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Office Building. `` The allegations in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times today that I engaged in improper activities in the House gym are completely untrue,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said in a statement issued by his office. `` There is simply no basis whatsoever for any suggestions to the contrary and I am confident that the ethics committee will concur.'' Gym supervisor <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogle </PERSON>, asked if he was aware of any misconduct in the gym, said, `` not to my knowledge.'' He said the gym is for members only and there are no provisions he is aware of for members to bring guests there with them. A source in the speaker's office, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said no allegations of misconduct in the gym have been brought to the attention of the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. One ethics committee source, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the full panel has not held discussions on the subject during its investigation of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> The newspaper, which said it could not ascertain the names of any of the other congressmen, said it learned of the evidence from several members close to the ethics investigation. These sources were not named. The Times quoted a male prostitute, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, as saying he and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> had performed sex acts `` on a couple of occasions'' after hours in the House gym. The newspaper said it had confirmed that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> had brought `` a number of young men'' to the gym, which generally is off-limits to the public and to staff. The paper said the ethics panel had determined that several congressmen had taken male and female guests into the gym `` for illicit sexual activity.'' The ethics committee has been investigating <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s conduct since <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> revealed his 1985-1987 relationship with the congressman to the Times.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today approved impeachment charges against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, ousting him from the federal bench for conspiring to obtain a $ 150,000 payoff. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' fate was sealed on the first of 17 articles of impeachment, when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 69-26 to convict him of conspiracy, more than the two-thirds margin required. In two hours of back-to-back roll calls, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> on eight articles, acquitted him on three and waived votes on the other six counts. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, the first black federal district judge in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, was removed from the bench even though he had been acquitted in 1983 in a criminal trial. Maintaining his innocence after the vote, he said he intends to run for governor of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and resume the practice of law. `` I'm upbeat and can go forward with my life ...,'' he told reporters. `` There are those of you who would say I should be banished in infamy. I know nothing in my life that requires that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also voted to convict <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> on seven subsequent charges that included perjury. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 48-47 and 60-35 in favor of two allegations, but the tallies were short of the two-thirds needed for conviction. In the other acquittal, it voted 95-0 to clear <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of a charge he improperly disclosed wiretap information. The voting over, Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, announced from the presiding officer's chair: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> having tried <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> judge for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> upon 17 of the articles of impeachment exhibited against him by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and two-thirds of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> having found him guilty ... it is therefore ordered that the said <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> be and is hereby removed from office <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was the sixth federal official removed as a result of impeachment. Flanked by his attorneys, the 53-year-old judge watched the proceedings from a table on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as one by one the lawmakers answered the roll call. He left the chamber a few minutes after the first of the articles was voted. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' problems began on Oct. 9, 1981, when his friend, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON> was arrested in an undercover operation of alleged fixing of court cases. Borders was convicted of bribery conspiracy, but <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted in a separate 1983 jury trial. However, a subsequent investigation led to <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' impeachment last year in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which accused him of plotting to obtain a bribe, lying during his trial and an unrelated charge of improperly disclosing federal wiretap information. Borders served a prison term in the case and currently is in jail on contempt charges for refusing to testify in the impeachment trial after being granted immunity from prosecution. `` I have no choice but to accept their judgment,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said after the vote in a statement that criticized the proceedings as unjust. `` In my opinion their judgment is void of the wisdom of the forefathers teachings regarding impeachment,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said. He said the case `` gives new meaning to double jeopardy and renders a severe blow to the cornerstone of justice _ the jury system.'' `` What the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has said is a standard of almost proven, innuendo and inference is good enough to remove a judge or executive officer by way of impeachment,'' he said. `` That is chilling and fraught with potential to do a lot of harm.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial was not a criminal proceeding. Thus, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> stands removed as a judge but remains a free man without any criminal record. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said he was `` hopeful that some book offers will come along.'' `` There are so many wonderful and tragic stories that are born of this saga. They need to be told and tell them I shall,'' he said. Senators sat silently at their desks as the roll was called. When the first tally was announced, defense attorney <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> showed the roll call to <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who then offered his hand and shook hands firmly with the lawyer. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acted after a seven-hour, closed-door session Thursday night that found it divided over the charges. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> has been proclaiming his innocence for eight years, and while he won some converts, it was short of what he needed for acquittal in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., on Thursday became the first senator to reveal his position, saying in a 76-page paper he would vote for acquittal <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said that after `` weighing the incriminating circumstantial inferences against the exonerating factors and giving due weight to his other unblemished lifetime record, I conclude there is insufficient evidence to convict'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of the bribery conspiracy charge. He said it was clear that prosecutors told jurors at the 1983 trial that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> lied in denying his guilt. `` Obviously, the jury did not accept those arguments,'' said <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, who served as district attorney of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> for eight years. He said the allegation that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> improperly disclosed wiretap information, in which <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> was a key witness, `` was neither convincing nor substantial.'' `` While there was direct evidence in the testimony of Mayor <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a number of factors made Mayor <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> a less than wholly credible witness,'' <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said.

 Sports officials from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Friday announced their first breakthrough in months-old talks on the Asian Games: they agreed on a flag to be used by athletes from both nations. Progress also was reported on plans to form a single team for the games next year in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but obstacles remain, such as what to call the team. `` There was a considerable progress on the flag and others, including the selection of athletes for the joint team,'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s chief delegate <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyung </PERSON> <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> said after the four-hour meeting at the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> truce site. `` We will do our best to form the first single team in our history and we in turn expect the South to do so,'' he said. His South Korean counterpart, <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung-sik </PERSON>, also reported progress. `` The northern side was rather active and straightforward and there was some progress. But I would not say the prospect is 100 percent bright,'' <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said after the meeting, which was open to the press. The talks were businesslike, with both sides avoiding political exchanges. Recent talks have bogged down in acrimonious political exchanges. Sports officials of the two Koreas met twice early this year before <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> unilaterally suspended dialogue in April to protest the arrest of South Korean dissident clergyman <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> was arrested for visiting <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> without permission from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been demanding <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s release, but North Korean officials did not raise the issue Friday. Delegates of the two Koreas quickly agreed on a flag to be used by the first inter-Korea joint team at the Asian Games. The flag will have a map of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula in blue on a white background. It is the first time both Koreas have agreed on a joint flag for an international sports event since they first started talks on forming a single team for the 1964 Olympics in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. All efforts to form a joint team for any event so far have failed. Both Koreas also agreed in principle to select athletes for the single team through joint training and open competition. They could not agree on the name of the team. Both sides agreed to use <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as the English name of the team but could not decide what name to use in <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> proposed Nov. 2 as a date of the next meeting but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> suggested Nov. 22. They settled on Nov. 16. The Korean peninsula was divided into communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and capitalist <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1945.

 A security systems owner says he was robbed at knifepoint by a woman who took about $ 200, but gave him $ 20 back and thanked him for being `` most generous.'' `` I got a tip for being robbed,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grubb </PERSON> said Thursday. `` She confronted me with a meat-carving knife,'' said <PERSON> Grubb </PERSON>, 50, who was returning to his car after dinner in downtown Duluth Wednesday. `` It looked like a machete.

 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said today it was pulling out of a group attempting to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, dealing a heavy blow to plans by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company's management and employees to acquire the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Last week, the group's announcement that it was unable to finance its planned $ 6.75 billion buyout triggered a nosedive by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> that roiled markets worldwide. Since then, the group and its advisers have been seeking financial backing for a revised offer at a lower price. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock, which has taken a pounding since the group's Oct. 13 announcement, took another dive in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> was down $ 21.12 -LCB- a share at $ 169 at midday, bringing its decline so far this week to about $ 110. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> as late as last weekend indicated it was confident a revised buyout plan could be arranged. But in recent days company officials have indicated that British Air was not necessarily wedded to a deal. British <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> issued a brief statement today saying it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> in the foreseeable future.'' After banks refused to back the original <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> deal, the buyout group led by management and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots scaled down its original $ 300 a share offer to $ 5.62 billion, or $ 250 a share. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> officials have been in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> this week, trying to win support for the revised offer from big Japanese banks. United is the second-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline after <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The deal, if successful, would be the largest employee-led buyout of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, a spokesman for Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, said the company had no comment on the action by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. Last weekend, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying it was confident a revised financing package would be arranged and the bid would be allowed to proceed. On Monday, the company confirmed it was pursuing the bid with <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the management-led group that also includes <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots. A <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who was not identified, in accordance with British custom, said he could not comment beyond the prepared statement, which gave no indication of why <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> backed out or when the decision was made. Under the original offer, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> would have provided $ 750 million, or about three-quarters of the equity, for the leveraged buyout and would have received a 15 percent stake in the airline.

 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived here Friday on a visit for which the former president reportedly will receive $ 2 million, and the Japanese government said it will award him one of its highest honors. The Reagans arrived on a chartered <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 along with 229 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military dependents they invited to hitch a ride to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will receive the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum for his `` contribution to the maintenance and promotion of friendship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has always been clear in refusing protectionism and tried his best to maintain the free trade system,'' <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said. The only other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to receive the honor was <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. The Reagans are in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> at the invitation of the Japanese government and the <ORGANIZATION> Fujisankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Fujisankei has refused to confirm reports <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will receive about $ 2 million for the visit, which it said will cost a total of about $ 7 million. Fujisankei, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest media group, owns the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoso </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s biggest commercial radio network, among dozens of other companies Like Fujisankei's chairman, <PERSON> Nobutaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Shikanai </PERSON>, many of the company's media outlets espouse conservativism and nationalism. At the time of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death and the controversy it spawned over his role in World War II, the <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> generally carried fewer critical views of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s imperial system. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> descended hand-in-hand from their plane and were met by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> and Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Naoki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>. In short remarks on the tarmac, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was `` delighted'' to be back in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The former president made a state visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1983 and attended the annual summit of industrialized nations in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in 1986. `` I deeply valued the working relationships I had with Japanese leaders during my time in the White House,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I have a special fondness for the Japanese people.'' The Reagans will attend several charity events and meet Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and other government figures during the two-day official part of the visit. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' chartered jet was half-filled with relatives of military personnel. The wives, children and parents on the plane were greeted by uniformed family members with tears, hugs and kisses. `` It's great. I was n't expecting to see them until next February,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, as he tousled the heads of his sons <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, 7, and <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>, 3, after they and their mother, <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON>, arrived from <LOCATION> Oxnard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> were so friendly and down to earth,'' said <PERSON> Cleo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bookwalder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, who traveled with her husband <PERSON> Don </PERSON> to see their son, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>, who is stationed in northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, for the first time in two years. The Bookwalders and others said the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> spent time on the jet shaking hands and talking with them. `` I want to write to someone in charge to thank them for making this possible,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, as she greeted her husband's parents, Violet and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>. The Reagans were whisked by helicopter from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Fujisankei </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hakone </LOCATION> Open-Air Museum in the forested hills near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fuji </LOCATION> where, after a brief welcoming ceremony, they were to spend Friday evening and Saturday resting. It is <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first major excursion since he had surgery Sept. 8 to drain fluid from his brain after suffering a head injury in a horseback riding accident this summer. The Reagans are scheduled to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Oct. 28.

 A cargo plane carrying construction equipment for earthquake-ravaged <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> crashed early Friday, killing all 17 people aboard, a newspaper reported. The crash near the airport in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, was the second air disaster in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region this week and recalled a similar disaster in the same area just after December's quake. The evening newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said an Ilyushin-76 on its way to the <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> airport slammed into a mountain 11 miles away. On board were seven crew members, seven passengers and three pilot-trainees, it said. A government commission was formed to investigate the accident. <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> is in the heart of the area devastated by the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake, which killed 25,000 people. Four days after the quake, an Il-76 carrying Soviet soldiers to help rescue quake victims plunged to the ground near <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>'s airport, killing all 78 people on board. On Wednesday, one of four engines on an Il-76 caught fire after takeoff in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and the plane crashed in the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, killing all 57 people aboard. Among those killed were paratroopers assigned to keep order in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>, which has been wracked by ethnic violence for more than a year.

 Firefighter <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> was visibly shaken after he crawled into an 18-inch-high opening on the collapsed Nimitz Freeway to pull out the bodies of a 6-year-old girl and her mother. `` It kills you. It just kills you. We all have families, you know. ... The adults are no problem. But the kids ...,'' he said Thursday before trailing off, dabbing tears. The carnage on the highway, also known as Interstate 880, upset even the most veteran of rescue workers. Here, on a 1 \ - mile-long section of interstate just south of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, Tuesday's earthquake Using shovels, backhoes, cranes and their hands, workers had recovered 21 bodies and located 52 vehicles between the pancaked decks of the highway by early today. Twenty-three of them were empty, single bodies were removed from nine of them and 20 others were yet to be investigated. In addition, 45 cars and trucks were pulled off the shattered upper deck or from the streets below, authorities said. But 167 people remained on the official missing list today for <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and several other communities. Dozens of vehicles still were sandwiched between tons of concrete. Early estimates put the number of dead at 250 people, but officials said Thursday night that they expected the total would be lower _ possibly much lower. Some rescuers, working around the clock, stubbornly clung to hopes that someone might be found alive in the highway debris. Others, including <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, had no hopes. `` We have n't found a live one yet, and I do n't think we will,'' he said. The even layers of the two-tiered elevated highway lay buckled and twisted like a writhing serpent, their concrete supports sheared off. On the railing of the flattened upper deck, spray paint pointed the way to crushed cars and shattered bodies: 1DOA signified a body, 2MT a pair of empty cars, a circle and arrow with the number 43 stood for a car 43 feet away. `` You could see blood splattered everywhere on the concrete,'' said volunteer <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Losorio </PERSON>, taking a break after a 13-hour shift that included moving concrete chunks by hand. The scene drew hundreds of onlookers on Thursday, including many who feared a relative or friend might be buried. During a live broadcast of <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 48 Hours,'' an angry man who believes his son may be in the wreckage confronted Mayor <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` Mayor, did you know that you are directly responsible for this here mess, this disaster?'' asked <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rubi </PERSON> said he had been turned away on Wednesday when he asked to climb the freeway structure and search for his son, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON>. The mayor replied, `` I'm sorry, I ca n't answer that question.'' Police took <PERSON> Rubi </PERSON> away but did not place him under arrest. Authorities say it could be at least three days before workers reach all the trapped vehicles, thereby getting an accurate count. After that, the highway will be demolished. Rumors of survivors periodically swept through the crowds of rescue workers, reporters and bystanders _ only to be knocked down by officials each time. Wednesday night brought reports that a rescuer had touched a live human hand in the wreckage. It was a false alarm. <PERSON> Losorio </PERSON> said he sneaked in, without permission, between the levels Wednesday night and spotted the forms of four or five people in their mangled vehicles. They may have been unconscious, he said. But he left because of the danger, and he agreed with rescue leaders' caution about sending workers into dangerous sections. `` All that might happen is someone else would get hurt,'' he said. A burly carpenter who declined to give his name said he had seen incredible bravery by his fellow carpenters and ironworkers. `` I saw people crawling in there in places where they were n't sure a branch was holding them up, running torches in places they were n't sure there was gas because they had to ... `` Four carpenters worked'til 2 this morning and went to their regular jobs at 7 and they'll be back tonight,'' he said. `` We're here just because we believe in it.

 The Army charged two soldiers with negligent homicide for using too much powder in an artillery round that strayed and killed three soldiers last month, officials said today. Sgt. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and Spec. <PERSON> Nickoles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, were told Wednesday that they were being charged in military court with negligent homicide and dereliction of duty through negligence, said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Samples </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sill </LOCATION>. The stray round struck near 80 soldiers on a rifle range outside the target area and injured 24 as well as killing three. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, a howitzer battery section chief, and <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>, a No. 2 cannoneer, are accused of using too much powder, which caused the 105mm howitzer round to land outside the designated impact area, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said. Ms. Samples said the two were not in confinement and were still performing their duties with C Battery, 2nd Battalion, 2nd Field Artillery at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sill </LOCATION>. She said, however, that they were not firing cannons. Ms. Samples said that if the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sill </LOCATION> commander, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallada </PERSON>, convenes a general court-martial and the men are convicted of both charges, the maximum sentence would be a bad conduct discharge and 15 months confinement with loss of pay and allowances.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has decided to forbid <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens from having financial dealings with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as well as more than 30 firms in which he has an interest, officials said today. Many of these businesses serve as intermediaries in trade between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which has been illegal since 1960, the sources said. The move serves to tighten the embargo against <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and also to penalize Panamanian firms controlled by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his wife, said the administration officials, who asked not to be identified. Americans who violate the new measure, scheduled to be announced next week, could face fines of up to $ 500,000, according to the officials. The step was first reported by the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Asked about the report, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> refused comment. The administration has been groping for ways to punish <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> without further damaging the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> economy, which has declined steeply over the past 18 months as a result of earlier sanctions imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> today renewed his call for the departure of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but said he opposes any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military move to achieve that goal. Winding up a two-day visit with a news conference, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> praised President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision not to use force in helping rebel officers in their bid to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> two weeks ago. `` Interventionism is never desirable,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said through a translator. `` I'm very pleased to know that it has not happened.'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has offered some ideas for resolving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis but he acknowledged that a solution can not be achieved by third countries. `` It should be a Panamanian solution; otherwise there will be no solution,'' he said. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> spoke to reporters at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after conferring Thursday night with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> situation. Today, he gave few details of the exchange and declined to characterize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position Following an earlier meeting, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> a model for Eastern European nations to follow in their moves toward democratic reforms. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s involvement in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and the 24-nation group that is providing economic assistance to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. He also noted <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s own move from dictatorship to democracy. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s idea for removing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> involves electing a new Panamanian president who would have the power to name a new military commander to replace <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. In contrast to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stated wish, the proposal would not require that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face a drug-trafficking indictment. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and Canadian Affairs, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position has not changed. Asked if the administration was flexible, however, he said, `` Sure.'' Privately, another administration official said the primary <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal is to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power, while the secondary goal is to try him on the drug case. Meanwhile, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Thursday it may speed up the planned withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military dependents from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, the newly appointed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military commander in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, also has recommended shortening soldiers' tour of duty so that fewer bring their families to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and top advisers discussed a range of issues, including economic and political reforms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the upcoming elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, international anti-drug efforts and their roles in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had warm words for <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> despite the rough patch in U.S.-Spanish relations that had occurred until last year when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to reduce its military presence in the southern <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> nation. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> insisted that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remove a group of F-16 fighter planes based in the country. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> agreed to accept them. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still has a military presence in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> that represents `` the maturing of the defense relationship'' between the two countries, <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A computer failure at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> disrupted tower operations for at least 12 hours, leaving controllers with a `` real problem with confidence,'' a union leader said. Air traffic at the nation's second busiest airport was disrupted for the second time in a week Thursday when a computer from the 1950s failed to operate properly, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The failure forced officials to limit the number of planes in and out of the airport each hour and to call in veteran controllers to help. The computer was restored to full service at about 2:30 a.m. today, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrent </PERSON>, assistant air traffic manager. It was the second outage in a week. On Saturday, when air traffic was heavy because of the Texas-Oklahoma football game, a technician mistakenly tried to program a radar computer from the wrong terminal causing an outage that left controllers uncertain for 19 minutes about the location of airplanes in the area, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` There is a real problem with confidence in the system,'' <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherotter </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> airport's controllers union, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegram </ORGANIZATION>. `` You come in here from day to day and you never know when something is going to happen.'' New equipment is not expected for another three to five years, officials said. `` It's not really aggravating but it's frustrating when you ca n't get new equipment in at a timely fashion to deal with the demands the private sector puts on you,'' <PERSON> Parrent </PERSON> said.

 The setting was Westminster Abbey, but the event was pure theater as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s finest actors paid tribute Friday to <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> and listened to `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> V'' spoken by the master himself. The tape-recording of the St. Crispin's Day speech from <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s play highlighted a ceremony of music, poetry and thanksgiving for the awesome talent of <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, who died July 11 at 82. `` There may be imitators but there is no second <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>,'' said Sir <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON>, eulogist at a ceremony brimming with eloquence, affection and a who's who of theatrical greats among the congregation of 2,000. Guinness was joined by fellow acting knights <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> in reciting from <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, the Bible, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donne </PERSON>. <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s widow, actress <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Plowright </PERSON>, sat in the front row, flanked by family members. A theatrical procession to the high altar began with <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, carrying <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s Order of Merit insignia. Next was <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON>, holding his late colleague's honorary Academy Award from 1979. Others in the pageant were <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> McKellen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Finlay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> read from <LOCATION> Ecclesiastes </LOCATION>. `` For 60 years he moved, astonished and teased his public. He could interpret human nature at its noblest, at its most comic and at its most pitiable,'' said the Dean of <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION>, the Very Rev. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayne </PERSON>, who conducted the service. Guinness' address was witty, elegant, anecdotal and moving. Eyes moistened as the 75-year-old actor quoted from `` Hamlet'': `` Good night, sweet prince, `` And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.'' <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> `` stands alongside the acknowledged great: <PERSON> Burbage </PERSON>, <PERSON> Betterton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Garrick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>. `` Even allowing for violent changes of fashion, I feel that each of those tremendous actors of the past would have recognized his style, applauded him and welcomed him as one of their own.'' `` Great,'' a much-abused word, readily applied to <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Perhaps it consists of a happy combination of imagination, physical magnetism, a commanding and appealing voice, an expressive eye _ and danger.'' <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, 81, <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s classmate at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drama </ORGANIZATION>, recited passages from <PERSON> Milton </PERSON>'s poem `` Lycidas'' with piercing grace and beauty. As the Gothic church windows glistened in noon sunshine, <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON>, 85, flooded <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abbey </LOCATION> with his beautiful voice, reading <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donne </PERSON>'s famous sonnet that begins `` Death be not proud.'' Among the guests was Prince <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s youngest son Deputy Prime Minister Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> represented the government. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Hildy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, represented Broadway and the Actors' Fund in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, as he became with his ennoblement in 1970, was cremated at a family funeral in southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. His ashes will be laid to rest in <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abbey </LOCATION> next year. Afterward, actor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> said: `` The service was not too downbeat. I enjoyed it very much.'' <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> would have liked the service. `` He'd have been outside the Abbey around the front counting the takings,'' he chuckled. <PERSON> McKellen </PERSON> said it was `` a solemn, happy occasion ... full of wonderful traditions and music.'' Discussion of potential heirs was quickly dismissed, with <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION>' eulogy setting the tone: `` Sometimes we read in the press of a young actor being hailed as a ` second <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>.' That is nonsense of course. ... He was unique.'' Echoed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>: `` There will never, never be another <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>A New Top Ticket Price for Broadway Musicals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Broadway musicals are getting more upscale _ tickets at a Tony award-winner now cost a tony $ 60. `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' boosted its ticket prices Thursday, jumping $ 5 from a $ 55 top for its best orchestra and choice mezzanine seats. Until February, when `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' opened, the top ticket price, was $ 50. But such long running hits as `` <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miserables </LOCATION>,'' `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' and `` Me and My Girl,'' quietly followed `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway,'' raising their prices from $ 50 to $ 55 over the last few weeks. Many of the big incoming musicals for this season including `` 3 Penny Opera'' with rock singer Sting, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tune </PERSON>'s `` Grand Hotel,'' and `` Annie 2'' will have a $ 55 top. `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' cost an estimated $ 8.7 million to produce. Because of its large cast _ more than 50 dancers and singers _ it operating expenses are $ 420,000 a week, the highest on Broadway. It has been grossing around $ 530,000 each week, but will have to play more than 70 weeks at capacity to earn back that high production cost. A $ 55 top ticket price also has been announced for `` The Merchant of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>,'' starring <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, the highest price ever for a non-musical. It begins a 12-week run in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Dec. 4. `` Orpheus Descending,'' the hit revival of the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> play starring <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>, raises its ticket price from $ 42.50 to $ 45, beginning with performances of Nov. 21. Most other plays on Broadway are charging $ 40 or $ 42.50 for their best seats.

 Will lofty prices for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> real estate tumble along with the roadways, bridges and homes devastated by this week's quake? Do n't bet the house on it, especially in the eternally optimistic Golden State. `` I've been here for over 60 years, and I've been through them all including the 1933 earthquake -LRB- that hit <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> -RRB-, and that was a bummer,'' said <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> <PERSON> Orloff </PERSON> of the Fred Sands brokerage in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, who listed <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' house at $ 6 million and <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s at $ 6.9 million. `` But an earthquake takes, what, 15 seconds? And then it's over for 30 years. And if you're fortunate your foundation is safe and your house is safe,'' she said. `` And if you're taking earthquake insurance and the house is destroyed, then you rebuild.'' Prices, meanwhile, `` just keep going up and up,'' Ms. <PERSON> Orloff </PERSON> said. Experts in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> said some multimillion-dollar deals for office buildings have been put on hold while damage inspections are made and prices of homes may drop briefly because of the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quake. But those effects will be temporary, they suggested, particularly because severe damage is limited to a few older areas, roadways and bridges. Even in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district, devastation was limited to eight square blocks of old homes built on landfill _ perhaps one-tenth of the district itself. `` You hate to say it's not devastated that much, but there's only small pockets that have been substantially damaged in the city,'' <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Makras </PERSON> said Friday `` No one's phone is ringing to buy today. Everyone is working with their present buyers to educate and comfort them,'' <PERSON> Makras </PERSON> said. `` But I think that once the city services are back and up and rolling, we will be back to a similar situation to what we had.'' Prices will intimidate people more than earthquakes in the long run, said <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. In August, just 10 percent of the households in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> could afford the area's median-priced home of $ 272,016, as calculated by a realty board `` affordability index,'' which among other things assumes a 20 percent down payment, average loan rate and a 30-year loan. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, the chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a major national broker for commercial and residential real estate, said deals would be delayed while buyers and lenders assess potential damages. But <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s commercial real estate market had been picking up since spring, buoyed by a general upturn in the area's economy, and he and <PERSON> Makras </PERSON> predict that trend will continue. `` I think memories will be very short,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Pravda Gets New Editor: Gorbachev Aide</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The millions of Soviets who see the world through the gray pages of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda were told Friday their newspaper had a new chief: a reformist philosopher and top aide to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The appointment of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> as Pravda's editor seems to consolidate the Soviet president's grip on the flagship party daily, which has noticeably lagged behind other official newspapers in printing the sort of eye-opening criticism encouraged by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s campaign for `` glasnost,'' or more openness. As Pravda's circulation has sagged to 9.3 million, that of more feisty publications such as <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION> and Arguments and Facts has soared. Thus, the influence on public opinion of the party's most authoritative newspaper was visibly on the wane. A joke shows the current popular view of the newspaper, which was founded by <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> in 1912 as an instrument to overthrow the Russian czar, and whose name means `` truth.'' `` There's no truth in <LOCATION> Izvestia </LOCATION>,'' goes the joke, referring to the Soviet government's evening paper whose name means `` news.'' And, the joke continues, `` there's no news in Pravda.'' <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, 60, erstwhile editor of the party theoretical monthly journal <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON>, replaces <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, a white-haired holdover from the era of <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, Sovie leader from 1964 to 1982. <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, 66, had served as Pravda's editor-in-chief for 13 years. Western sources identify the Russian-born graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Philosophy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s personal adviser on ideological matters. <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> is also reputed to be the country's top biomedical ethicist and in the 1960s criticized <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s henchman, biologist <PERSON> Trofim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lysenko </PERSON>, for waging an ideological witchhunt against colleagues that led to the exile, torture and death of many talented In the 1970s, <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> reportedly fell from favor because of his reformist views. He was rehabilitated after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became Soviet leader in 1985. <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>'s latest appointment was made by the ruling party Politburo and announced by Pravda in a page one report on the Politburo's Thursday meeting. The report was also read on state-run TV Thursday night. A Pravda worker said Friday that <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> had not yet started work. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was expected to go to the paper's headquarters _ on <LOCATION> Pravda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ to present <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> personally to the staff, the worker said. <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, the No. 1 journalist in the Soviet pecking order by virtue of his position as Pravda's chief editor and chairman of the official <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>, had spoken out for glasnost, once complaining there were still `` restricted zones'' where coverage was n't permitted. But he still favored keeping government processes under strong Communist Party control, rejected the notion that there should be competing political parties, and warned against allowing criticism of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> policy to go too far. His clout as Pravda editor was considerable: he once revealed he was allowed to attend Politburo meetings. But under his tutelage, Pravda printed the same terse <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> bulletins on the Politburo's doings that appear in every other Soviet paper, and little more <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> has been working as an assistant to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the party's general secretary, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in a brief biographical note. In that post, Soviet sources say, he helped author a major change in the philosophical underpinnings of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> foreign policy. For decades, the Soviets were ideologically committed to aiding the worldwide class struggle, but in 1987, presumably due to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s impetus, they proclaimed instead their adherence to `` universal human values,'' meaning they would cooperate with regimes once regarded as enemies. <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, a doctor of philosophical sciences, headed the journal <ORGANIZATION> Questions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philosophy </ORGANIZATION> in 1986-77 and has been chairman of the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Philosophical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> since 1987, the same year he became an aide to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He served as chief editor of <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON> in 1986-87, watershed years in the elaboration of party doctrine when the Gorbachev-era policies of `` glasnost'' and `` perestroika,'' or reconstruction, were being hammered out and put to practical use. According to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> also wrote a book along with another top party official fated to become a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> adviser, <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagladin </PERSON>, titled `` Global Problems of Our Times: Scientific and Global Aspects.'' <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> is a member of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Ideological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and a member of the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> department of law and philosophy. He also has a seat in the new Soviet parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. Western references report <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> was a philosophy student at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1953, the same period the future <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was enrolled there to study the same subject. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the son of a southern Russian peasant, was in the university's law school at the time.

 A fire in a 21-story high-rise today shut the local offices of the state's courts and the state attorney general just days after a major earthquake closed those same offices in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The fire was limited to an unoccupied machinery room on top of the building, but other offices were closed while firefighters inspected the building, said city Fire Department spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>. More than 250 firefighters battled the blaze, which broke out about 12:35 a.m. and was doused about 40 minutes later, <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> said. Three helicopters transported crews to the roof of the building where firefighters gained control of the blaze from above, he said. `` The firefighters on the roof obviously played a big role in putting the fire out because the building was tall,'' <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> said. Firefighters were hampered slightly by work in the building to remove asbestos insulation, <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> said. He said no one was inside the structure when the fire started and there were no injuries reported. Firefighters were not sure what caused the fire, <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> said, adding that no damage estimate was available. The <LOCATION> Wilshire </LOCATION> district, which includes several high-rise office buildings, is located a little more than one mile west of downtown. On Tuesday, a 6.9-magnitude quake seriously damaged the historic state office building in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, making unsafe the offices of Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 About 50,000 peasants whose homes were destroyed by earthquakes prepared Friday to spend a second night outdoors on the windy north <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> plain. No new deaths were reported Friday, leaving the toll at 29 dead with more than 150 injured. Many peasants said they survived because the first quake Wednesday night woke them up and sent them outdoors. A stronger quake early Thursday brought their homes down. Two more strong aftershocks were felt Friday morning. `` This was the worst quake we've ever had,'' <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rongzhen </PERSON>, a peasant in <LOCATION> Xicaitian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> province, told a Western reporter. About half the 230 houses in the village, made of mud or sticks and branches, suffered varying degrees of damage. All the homes were destroyed in nearby <LOCATION> Bucun </LOCATION>, a village of 1,280. Two villagers were killed _ a man and the elderly mother he was trying to carry to safety. The survivors rigged tents of quilts and straw and built small fires Thursday night, and prepared to do the same Friday night. Temperatures in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, 135 miles to the east, have been dipping below 40 degrees at night with a chill wind. Weather in the quake-affected area is similar. The Ministry of Civil Affairs, in charge of emergency rescue, refused Friday to answer questions and referred callers to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> and Trade. There, an official who gave his name only as <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> said 11,000 homes had been destroyed in <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> provinces, and 50,000 people were homeless. He had no other information. <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> villagers seemed dazed and unsure about how to begin rebuilding. `` We just hope that the earthquakes stop,'' <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said. He said he lost his home and most of his possessions, worth a total of about $ 800. He and others said it would not be possible to rebuild their homes before winter sets in, but they had no idea what they would do for shelter. Some victims dug with shovels and poles beneath the mounds of mud and stone that were their homes, but found little that could be salvaged. One woman found an unbroken light bulb. Someone else found a black and white television, a prized possession in poor areas such as <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION>, and set it carefully on a pile of straw. National TV broadcast its first report on the quake and said the government had set up a special fund of $ 53,850 for quake aid. The television showed boxes of medicine being unloaded from a pickup truck. An official distributed thick pancakes, a local staple, from a pile heaped high on the ground. The report said more than 1,000 soldiers and medical workers were sent into the area. Footage shot by <PERSON> Shanxi </PERSON> provincial TV but not shown on the national news showed doctors in makeshift clinics treating people with broken bones and badly bloodied heads. The national news focused on local officials arriving to inspect damage, and only briefly showed an adobe home in ruins and doctors treating a victim. The official media has given little attention to the quake, perhaps because of continued popular belief that natural disasters spell out heaven's displeasure with the ruler. `` Although losses were heavy, the morale of the masses is stable,'' the television news said. There has been no announcement of plans to provide temporary shelter for the homeless or rebuild the destroyed homes. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> has said it is unlikely that more strong aftershocks will hit in the near future. The bureau said the Thursday morning quake, which measured 6.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, was the strongest to hit northern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since a 1976 earthquake that leveled most of the northeast city of <LOCATION> Tangshan </LOCATION> and killed 240,000 people. The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Tuesday's earthquake in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was measured at 6.9 on the scale.

It was the beginning of a weekend break from international diplomacy for the prime ministers of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, who are attending a summit with other movers and shakers of the 49-nation Commonwealth. National leaders were bedecked with garlands of seashells on arrival at the plush new resort on <LOCATION> Langkawi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the Straits of <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION>, 210 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, site of the week-long summit.

She got in first and <PERSON> Zardari </PERSON> handed in <LOCATION> Bilawal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asif </LOCATION>, their son. Mother and child posed for photographs before they drove off. Each government leader was assigned one of the two-bedroom chalets, which are grouped in the 25-acre complex to resemble a kampung, or Malay village. The hotel was closed to all but the dignitaries from the organization of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and its former colonies. Buses escorted by police collected them at the airport after the 55-minute flight from <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION> to this island of 33,000 people. The road to the hotel eight miles away, winds past coconut plantations and rice paddies, was guarded by soldiers posted at 500-yard intervals. Friday night's buffet dinner included seven choices of fish, tropical fruit, prawn fritters, seafood paella and steamed yams. A lobby notice board said the movie `` Batman'' and assorted cartoons were the evening's entertainment. Others could contemplate the legend of the lovely Princess <PERSON> Mahsuri </PERSON>, whose tomb is a tourist attraction. Once upon a time, the princess was involved in court intrigue and sentenced to death after unjust accusations that she was unfaithful to her husband. Visitors are told she placed a curse on the island that denied it prosperity for seven generations.

 A former South African government employee said authorities have set up an intelligence operation designed to influence the elections in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported Friday. Officials even told the covert team to find embarrassing informaton on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials as part of an effort to ensure that a black nationalist group does come to power, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the Namibian newspaper. Mrs. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> quit her job in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> and subsequently claimed she had been a spy for the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> while working for the government. She was quoted Friday as saying that her part of her duties with the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> included a campaign to discredit the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> contingent that is coordinating <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, the South African administrator of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, denied covert activities were being conducted by his office. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> was involved in telling the public about election procedures and that the South African government provided additional staff for that purpose. However, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said authorities with the world body believe a covert smear campaign might exist. `` I would have to confess -LRB- the report -RRB- did not take us totally by surprise,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON>, referring to Mrs. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>'s allegations. There was `` a pattern that certainly raised questions in our minds whether there might not be some kind of orchestrated effort'' by the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, he said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> for 74 years, but agreed to grant the territory independence under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervison. Elections for a national assembly are set for Nov. 7-11 and independence is expected early next year. The <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which waged a 23-year bush war against <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African rule, is heavily favored in the polls. Mrs. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> abruptly left her job in the Namibian capital of <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> on Sept. 23 and flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with her South African husband, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>. The Namibian, which supports the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, interviewed the couple there. Mrs. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> said she was part of a seven-member government contingent with a $ 1.3 million budget. The group was to help promote the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy. She said the team was instructed to gather information on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials for the purpose of embarrassing them. The group had an entertainment allowance of $ 38,000 for this purpose, she told the newspaper. Any embarrassing information was to be fed to `` selected journalists'' working for newspapers opposed to the black nationalist group, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> said she also was sent to interview <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON>, commander of the notorious police counterinsurgency unit, <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>. She said she was told to portray the unit as a `` group of ordinary, decent people doing a great job.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> said her group included two members of the South African <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, a police inspector, and intelligence officials. She said she and her husband have worked for the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for 10 years. She said they fled because they believed they had been uncovered. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Steward </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that Mrs. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> `` was a junior official who did not have access to sensitive material.

 Building supply stores, tool rental firms and salvage companies braced Friday for their busiest weekend ever as residents started to repair their earthquake-shattered homes. As damage estimates surpassed $ 4 billion, merchants throughout the area rushed to fill orders for glass, plywood, cement, flashlights, power generators _ and tarpaulins to shield from a rainstorm sweeping in this weekend. `` It seems like the biggest problem now is going to be the rain,'' said <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Santee </PERSON>, the owner of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>'s Central Home Supply. `` All those people who have a chimney down or a hole in their roof need a tarp. What the earthquake missed, the rain should get.'' Of course, many homeowners could do nothing. Their homes were either beyond repair or were condemned as unsafe. <ORGANIZATION> Multiquip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a distributor of light construction equipment, is toiling to ship electrical generators to the area. `` The industry is in extremely bad shape to take care of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> disaster because of hurricane Hugo,'' <PERSON> Irv </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, the firm's president, said from the firm's <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, headquarters. `` We were totally cleaned out of generators. We're scrambling to get as many as we can. More than 25,000 homes were still without power Friday morning. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said his company's reserve stock of 1,000 generators is gone. `` We are renting lots of light towers, hydraulic house jacks, skip loaders and scissor lifts,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Probasco </PERSON>, a manager at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>'s A-1 Rents. `` For things we're out off, we're directing our customers to our competitors.'' Amid the growing demand for repair materials, merchants must combat inoperative telephone lines, jammed or closed freeways and sometimes severe damage to their own headquarters. The main <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> warehouse for auto-glass giant <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> was closed by the quake, with loss of inventory estimated in excess of $ 50,000, said branch manager <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrell </PERSON>. `` We're shipping from other locations,'' <PERSON> Burrell </PERSON> said as the company tried to replace scores of broken windshields. `` We're inoperative here. While the shipping delays almost certainly will result in higher prices for some materials, there have been no reports of price gouging for items in shortest supply. `` I'm not trying to get into a price war,'' said <PERSON> Probasco </PERSON>. `` We're just here to help people.'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, owner of Central Allied Glass with a dozen stores in the earthquake's vicinity, said that many homeowners are waiting for aftershocks to subside before replacing broken windows. `` A lot of people do n't want to put glass in right away,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` They want to relax and wait until there's no more shaking. `` But from our understanding, everybody's glass stock is in great shape. They're not having problems with the distributors.'' Other glass companies are boarding up most broken windows and are planning to complete glass replacements in coming weeks. `` If a store has lost its front, that's our first priority,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobel </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We're just boarding up now and we'll start installing glass this weekend.''

We're expecting quite a busy weekend. We have never had a situation like this before.'' At the same time, retailers are busy with a surge in demand for consumer goods like bottled water, cleaning supplies like brooms, mops, buckets and paper towels. `` Water right now is the No. 1 priority,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> manager for public relations.

In <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, 14 miles north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, more landslides were expected in the mountains where 60 homes already have been destroyed and at least 100 more directly threatened. `` The geologists will see if the cracks are in the bedrock or in the ground,'' said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>'s fire district chief. `` If it was just soil that was loose, that would be easier because we could shore up the houses. `` If there are cracks in the bedrock, the whole mountain could come down.''

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Friday welcomed <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first non-Communist prime minister in 40 years and told him there must be no turning back from political change. <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a longtime Solidarity activist who came to power Aug. 24, thanked the Polish-born <PERSON> pope </PERSON> for his support `` during the difficult years'' _ referring to the suppression of Solidarity after the martial law crackdown in 1981. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> intellectual and an old friend of the pope, made <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> his first foreign visit since his appointment as the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-Communist premier. The pope called the private 20-minute meeting `` historic.'' In an emotional reunion, the men embraced outside the pope's private library <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> told an aide there was no need for introductions. Later, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said the meeting was the `` crowning, the fruit of the dialogue, of which today we see the results.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> turned toward a Polish TV crew and responded in Polish, ` We hope there's no turning back.'' `` This is not possible,'' seconded Foreign Minister <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in June 1979, eight months after his election to the papacy, helped spark demands for democracy that led to the formation of Solidarity, the first non-Communist labor movement in the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> told a news conference that `` Polish-Soviet relations are at their most crucial moment.'' He said there are many problems, but one of the biggest is economic collaboration. `` We want to develop our economy through the East and the West,'' he said, noting that he would discuss these problems when Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> comes to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> next week. During that visit a date for a <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will be set. He also repeated his plea for immediate help from the West, saying his country needs loans, investments and emergency food aid within the next two months to help it through the harsh Polish winter. The church, which has historically played a pivotal role in this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country, took part in the long negotiations that led to elections this year and approval of a 24-member Cabinet that includes 12 Solidarity members and four Communists. As evidence of the change sweeping the Soviet bloc, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> on Friday ordained as bishops the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s first ambassador to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since the Communists broke diplomatic relations after World War II and the first Roman Catholic bishop in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> in 60 years. `` Is n't this a sign of the changes taking place, which are happening for the good of all believers,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said in his homily in the service in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica. Aides said <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> and the pope have met some 20 times during <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s 11-year pontificate, most recently when Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in April. The Polish pope and prime minister also met privately at lunch after the audience.

<HEAD>Hopes Dim for Repatriation of Cambodian Refugees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The failure of recent peace efforts has dimmed prospects for repatriation of the more than 300,000 Cambodians in refugee camps on the Thai side of the border, aid workers said Friday. `` Repatriation is undoubtedly farther away from us than it appeared even three months ago,'' said <PERSON> Urs </PERSON> <PERSON> Boegli </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Many aid officials had felt increased diplomatic efforts put a settlement within reach, but an international conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in June did not resolve the civil war, which began with the Vietnamese invasion of December 1978. About 300,000 of the Cambodians who fled the brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime or the invasion that ended it remain in the U.N.-assisted camps. Fighting nearby has intensified since Vietnamese soldiers left <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> late in September, and <PERSON> Boegli </PERSON> said the camps are exposed to increased danger. `` Do we have to fear a full-fledged attack on the camps?'' he said. `` Of course this possibilty has to remain part of our security planning.'' He said the presence of guerrillas in the camps increased the danger. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> recently reduced food aid to the largest camp, Site 2, on grounds the rebels were diverting supplies to their own use. <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas control the camp, which houses 140,000 refugees. Although repatriation may be delayed, aid agencies still must prepare for it, said S.A.M.S. <PERSON> Kibria </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special representative for Cambodian refugees. `` The time has come to look beyond our established role of providing basic emergency relief and consider greater emphasis on social program to support and rebuild'' Cambodian society, he said. `` There are children as old as 10 or 12 ... who have never known life outside a refugee camp,'' <PERSON> Kibria </PERSON> said, and the longer they remain, `` the more serious becomes the risk that ... we will return to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> whole communities of socially handicapped persons unable to earn a living or readjust to conditions in their own country.'' <PERSON> Kibria </PERSON> said more money was needed to finance reintegration programs. He also expressed concern about reports that guerrillas may move refugees back into <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> without involving international organizations. `` Any movement of the population into <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> which lacks the assurances of safety and freedom of choice can not be supported,'' he said. <PERSON> Toshiyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Niwa </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Border Relief Operation, said the breakdown of peace talks could increase frustration among the refugees in camps already plagued by murder, rape and other crimes.

<HEAD>KGB Plans to Cut Soviet Border Zone, Remove Barbed Wire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> plans to cut the restricted border zones it guards to a 10th of their current size and take down the barbed wire in many areas, top officials of the agency told a Soviet legislative committee Friday. Border-crossing procedures will also be simplified, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in a report on a session of the new committee that oversees the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, told the panel there was no reason to maintain such a large border zone, the news agency said. It did not specify the total area of the zone that the 200,000 border guards protect now, or how it will be reduced in the future. The border plan was typical of recent <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> efforts to show that it is moving away from a Cold War mentality and trying to keep pace with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s push for greater openness and democracy. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> has given several interviews to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media, and he defended the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> before the legislature at his confirmation last summer, saying it stayed strictly within the law at home. About 3,400 people were nabbed for illegally crossing into the border zone since the beginning of last year, <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> deputy chief <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Matrosov </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said the southern Soviet border, particularly where it touches on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, requires extra frontier guards to combat smuggling and armed gangs, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. But in general, <PERSON> Matrosov </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s improving relations with most of its neighbors, including <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, has led to reduced tension on its border. In some places along the Chinese frontier, the forbidden zone is hundreds of miles thick. Even along the border with its <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has strung barbed wire and set armed <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> guards in towers. Foreigners are barred from a 16-mile strip along the Soviet border with <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The country plans to `` remove the barbed-wire entanglement in many areas,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> alone is 3,000 miles, the longest land border between two countries. The Defense and <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was created as part of political reforms aimed at giving more real power to the Supreme Soviet legislature, which was formerly a rubber-stamp for Communist Party decisions.

 The voice of <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> boomed out of the drizzle in the chill air outside the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> entrance to the Capitol. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> had just been convicted on the first of many articles of impeachment, an act that formally removed him from office as a federal district judge for the southern district of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The former judge had a surprise in store. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber, Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s president pro tempore, gravely asked the question yet another time: `` Senators, how say Is the respondent, <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, guilty or not guilty?'' And the voices came: `` Guilty,'' `` guilty,'' `` not guilty,'' `` guilty,'' over and over. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> had left the voices behind after the second vote to convict him, striding from the chamber to receive bearhugs from supporters. In a morning consumed by votes by senators soberly rising from their gleaming mahogany desks, he would be convicted on eight counts, acquitted on three. Outside on the steps, <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who had been the first black federal judge in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> history, looked out over the thrusting cameras and microphones, his commanding voice penetrating through the crowd. His conviction was unjust, he said. The fact that a jury had in 1983 acquitted him on similar charges marked his impeachment before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> with the brand of double jeopardy and dealt a `` severe blow to the cornerstone of justice _ the jury system.'', <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> then took a wholly unexpected tack. Defiant, smiling, appearing supremely self-confident, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said that as far as he is concerned his career was far from over. `` Now that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has forced a career change on me, I must go forward,'' he said. He will go forward, he said, to become a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for governor of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, to become a far from ordinary candidate. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said he had called his mother immediately after the first of the votes, first to tell her the result, then to say, `` we're off and running.'' `` I think I have an excellent chance,'' he said. `` ... I do n't have anything to lose by offering an interest in the issues facing the voters of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> I think I can take the campaign to a level that everybody will be proud of. `` Quite frankly, I think that not only can I be elected, I think I will be ... I'm going to enjoy being governor.'' A reporter asked: `` Why do you think you can be elected after what just happened?'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> responded: `` Because I think that Floridians are tired of ordinariness. And if there's anything else I bring to it, it's this experience, it's not ordinary `` Oh, I will hear signals,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said. `` I will hear, ` Oh, it's shameful that he should do these kinds of things.' `` Let me tell you, my mama had a man; she did not have anybody that was afraid of the system. I think change needs to take place and I'm going to be involved in that change until I die.'' He said there are no legal barriers to his candidacy. `` Banishment is a fiction,'' he insisted, and, pointing upwards in the direction of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber, added: `` And what we just saw was extremely fictional ... There are those of you who will say I should be banished in infamy, I know nothing that I have done that requires that.'' But <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> also made clear that there may be something quixotic in his candidacy. `` I will go forward with my life and I'll let the voters of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> tell me that I'm a terrible person _ and I will go forward with my life,'' he said. Was he at all downcast by the fact of his conviction? `` I feel just fine,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said, crisply emphasizing each word. `` Perhaps better than I did quite some time ago.''

<TEXT>
 Opposition parties trying to unseat Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in elections next month said Friday they would fight corruption, ease poverty and restore `` national dignity.'' A 40-page platform waved at a news conference by <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s chief rival and a senior leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, offers few radical departures from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s current stated policies. In many respects, it recalls pledges <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> made five years ago when his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was re-elected in a landslide after the assassination of his mother, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Elections scheduled for Nov. 22, 24 and 26 will choose a new lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which holds the political power in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The opposition platform reserved its sharpest barbs for corruption, the rallying cry of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s campaign to lead the 880 million people of the world's most populous democracy. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a 58-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member and <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> ally, echoed his platform's call for full investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> arms scandal. The Swedish manufacturer is accused of paying up to $ 50 million in kickbacks to clinch a $ 1.4 billion contract with the <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION> government. `` The funds will be restored to the nation and the guilty punished,'' he declared at the news conference, and pledged to restore <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s `` national dignity.'' When the <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> contract was signed in 1986, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s defense minister He later resigned because of what he called official reluctance to investigate newspaper allegations that powerful Indians took payoffs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> repeatedly has denied profiting from the deal personally or that Indians received payoffs or commissions, but the allegations have dogged him for 2 -LCB- years. The opposition alliance seeks a broad base ranging from communists to right-wing Hindu religious groups. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a secular centrist, has the task of maintaining unity in such a coalition. No reliable poll has been taken in two months, but the consensus of analysts and observers is that <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> face a tough challenge if the opposition hangs together. In its manifesto, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> also says it will streamline a labyrinthine bureaucracy that predates independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. It pledges to establish a national security council under the prime minister to `` help evolve a consensus on our foreign and defense policies,'' which the opposition claims are `` pursued in an irrational and arbitrary manner by the present government.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s armed forces number 1.4 million, fourth largest in the world after the superpowers and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It has tested nuclear devices, has an expanding deep-water navy and is one of only seven nations with demonstrated ability to develop and fire intermediate-range ballistic missiles. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s opposition promised to `` be convincingly peace-oriented'' and take `` a total view of defense rather than a fractured service-by-service approach, which is the case at present.'' Foreign policy essentials are the same as <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s. The opposition platform cited the importance of remaining non-aligned and strenghtening friendly relations with both the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Sources Report Encouraging Response From Syria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> foreign minister returned to this resort town Friday after talks in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> aimed at resolving the Lebanese crisis, and sources said he received encouraging responses that may break the deadlock. Foreign Minister Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Faisal </PERSON> began a series of meetings with Lebanese parliamentarians who for three weeks have been discussing their country's future. The parliamentary talks have been stalemated by Lebanese Christian leaders' demands that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before Lebanese Moslems are given a greater share of political power. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League mandate to end the civil war. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian leader, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, said the Syrians abrogated the mandate by siding with the Moslems in the war, and he has vowed to drive them out. Sources at the Taif conference, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> was carrying `` positive'' replies from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> that may break the deadlock in the search for a plan to end the 14-year-old war. Before leaving the Syrian capital, the foreign minister said: `` Everybody is keen to ensure the success of the Taif meeting.'' He said cooperation with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on the mission was strong, but he would not go into details. A mediating committee of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has visualized a maximum two-year phased withdrawal of the Syrians from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and its environs. According to a draft charter, the Syrian troops would be redeployed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> for an indefinite period until a strong central government was established in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and a security pact signed with <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected the indefinite stay and insisted the Syrian withdrawal start as soon a draft charter for national reconciliation is ratified by a formal parliamentary session in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Among the ideas circulated in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, according to conference sources, is that a token Syrian pullout be completed before the parliamentary session to approve political reforms and elect a president. A `` security zone'' would be set up around the parliament building in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and probably would be policed by Algerian troops, the sources said, to ensure that all arrived safely for the session. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said in newspaper interviews published Friday that the parliamentary deputies should come home. `` I believe that this tough experience -LRB- in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> -RRB- has convinced them once and for all that negotiations should not be conducted under occupation and no reforms can be achieved under occupation,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration appeared Friday to be at a critical point in its drive to open <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks as <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> appealed for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help in drawing Palestinian Arabs into negotiations. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> might soon decide to turn his attention to other foreign policy issues. But diplomatic sources questioned the notion that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was reaching a dead-end. `` You have a dialogue at the very highest level. It is very substantial. They are discussing substantial ideas that might lead to a breakthrough,'' said the sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, in a letter to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> delivered on Wednesday, urged the administration to help overcome `` intimidation'' keeping <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> from participating in the prime minister's proposal for elections, the sources said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also asked <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to try to enlist moderate <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments, such as <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, to join with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in trying to implement the elections proposal, the sources said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> followed up the letter in a telephone coversation with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> Thursday evening and with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> on Friday morning. But the details were not disclosed as <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> took off for a long weekend at his ranch in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Before he left, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was `` not going to pursue this from here to eternity.'' Also, the official told reporters after demanding anonymity, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was giving the problem `` 100 percent but there could be a limit to how long you continue.'' Among the main roadblocks are rejection of the election proposal by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s insistence that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members not participate in talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, after accusing <PERSON> SHamir </PERSON> of hindering the process with unhelpful and disappointing remarks, offered assurances Thursday it was not trying to pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which in its covenant is committed to dismantling the Jewish state. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, meanwhile, thanked <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in the letter for his efforts to implement the election proposal, which is designed to produce limited self-rule for <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and negotiations five years later on an overall settlement. The letter was not made public, but the diplomatic sources dislosed <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> elaborated in it on his refusal to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and on his election proposal and urged <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to saek support for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> from modertate Arab countries. Also, the sources said, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> asked the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to discuss the election plan with Palestinian leaders on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> who are more likely than the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to respond favorably. After all, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> reasoned, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in the territories are the ones who would vote, negotiate and ultimately live under the arrangement worked out with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The prime minister stressed the point local <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> need bolstering so they will not be afraid to stand up to `` intimidation,'' the sources said, adding: `` This is very high-profile, intimate diplomacy. They may come to an agreement.''

<HEAD>Laws Passed to Rehabilitate Victims of Political Trials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> voted Friday to rehabilitate victims of political trials in the Stalinist era and to disband the armed guard created to protect the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after a 1956 revolt. The decision to dissolve the Worker's <ORGANIZATION> Militia </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s private army, came less than two weeks after the party renamed itself the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and committed itself to pluralism and democratic ideals. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose leadership is largely comprised of the same people who led the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, had backed a proposal to disarm the 60,000-member force but keep it as a civil defense organization. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> remains in power at least until parliamentary elections due early next year. They are to be the first freely contested national elections since the Communists consolidated power in 1948. `` The existence of the Worker's Militia ... is no longer justified,'' declared <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Borics </PERSON> in introducing the legislation. On the last day of the session, the house adopted two bills exonerating victims of political trials and other reprisals. One bill rehabilitated all those convicted of revolutionary activity after 1956 and pledged unspecified compensation to victims of reprisals. Earlier this year the government had already rehabilitated <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, the leader of the 1956 uprising, and several of his close associates. A second bill also formally rehabilitated those victimized between 1948 and 1962 _ the period now officially considered <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Stalinist period. The house also overwhelmingly approved a proposal to declare Oct. 23, the day the 1956 anti-Soviet uprising began, as a day of `` national reconciliation.'' However, the house rejected a motion favored by the opposition that it be made a national holiday. Tens of thousands are expected to rally in front of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Monday to mark the 33rd anniversary of the start of the 1956 revolt. It will be the first time such a public rally is permitted. In a statement issued Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> presidium said it `` rejects'' the Soviet invasion that crushed the revolt and opposed all forms of intervention or interference in a country's sovereignty Reforms enacted in the past year have put <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> at the forefront of democratic change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> along with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the only country in the Soviet bloc with a non-Communist-led government. This week's session of parliament was dedicated to enacting legislation designed to create the legal framework for next year's multiparty elections Earlier in the day the body adopted an electoral law envisaging a modified system of proportional representation. It also adopted a bill outlining procedures for electing a national president, but postponed a decision on when he would be chosen. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and most of the major opposition groups had tentatively agreed on Nov. 26 as the date for a direct election, with subsequent presidents appointed by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. But some opposition groups, fearing the short campaign period would give the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate an unfair advantage, have collected nearly 200,000 signatures calling for a referendum on the issue. A minimum of 100,000 signatures is required to force a plebiscite. This issue is to be discussed when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> resumes Oct. 30. On Thursday, the house passed legislation permitting opposition parties to field candidates in the elections. The legislature also voted overhwelmingly to ban parties from the workplace, defeating an alternative proposal backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to allow party activity there. Politicization of the workplace has been a key element of Communist indoctrination.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured the earthquake-ravaged <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area today, saying `` I'm deeply moved'' as he got a first-hand look at a collapsed freeway that trapped rush-hour motorists The president said he would `` do what's needed to be done'' to speed federal aid. Administration officials worked on a program of assistance as the president made his brief trip. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> offered no pricetag but said the federal government would take on `` a very, very major role in helping <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' After stops in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to this coastal community only a few miles from the epicenter of Tuesday night's killer earthquake. `` We've got to get these disaster centers open and take the claims,'' he said as he walked down the main street looking at shattered buildings. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited the work of public and private relief agencies and said, `` God bless those volunteers.'' `` In terms of what it will cost, I do n't know,'' he said. `` But the federal government will work with these other entities, the government entities, the private entities, to see the suffering is alleviated, the restoration begins.'' He added, `` I'm willing to do what's needed to be done.'' `` Jesus,'' muttered the president as he walked next to the two-deck freeway in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, the ground covered with rubble, including massive chunks of concrete and giant fallen pillars. Twisted steel girders protruded from the collapsed structure. Smashed cars were visible at some points between the upper and lower decks. `` I am deeply moved by this, saddened in some ways, yet very stimulated by this team effort,'' the president said. He complimented rescue teams and said, `` I'm very proud'' of the military participation. He also said he admired `` the way this community is pulling together ... we'll see what we can do to be part of the answer.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, tieless and wearing a flight jacket with the presidential seal on the right breast, toured the area on foot and chatted with rescue workers. The president took a two-block motorcade to the site of the Interstate 880 collapse. He was greeted by several <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> congressmen, including Democrats <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fortney </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, who had attended a briefing by local officials with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his arrival at <LOCATION> Moffett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, also accompanied him to the rescue site, staying on the periphery as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chatted with the authorities. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> had complained earlier that he was snubbed by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> toured the area Wednesday. From <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where he met with city officials. The base, on the shore of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, is adjacent to the heavily damaged <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced he was appointing <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> to coordinate federal relief efforts. The president confessed he had had some second thoughts about visiting the quake area, not wanting to get in the way. But, he said he concluded, `` if you do n't go _ why it's neglect.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also taped a television public service announcement here seeking to reassure the quake-weary <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area that help was on the way. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, one of three mayors accompanying the president on his tour, told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` We need fast action. We need checks written on the spot.'' `` We've got to work with each other,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the local officials. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> would not say how much money was in the package but claimed `` it will be substantial.'' `` These first 90 days virtually all of ... emergency expenses would be covered, I assume, by the federal government,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. He said cleanup and repair were `` primarily a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> effort'' but the federal government would help in any way it could. From <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> he flew across the bay to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to tour the heavily damaged <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was greeted at <LOCATION> Moffett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> by Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., Gov <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, a Democrat who represents the southern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. Democrats have pledged at least $ 2.5 billion in federal funds to assist quake victims. But <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think the $ 2.5 billion will have a degree of preciseness attached to it.'' He said, `` I do n't think anybody can tell you at this moment exactly how much is going to be needed.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip, on the heels of the tour by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, is part of swift administration action in the wake of complaints that the federal government responded too slowly after Hurricane Hugo struck the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> following the hurricane to assess damage there. `` I will be going out there tomorrow to take a look and to provide encouragement to people,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday as congressional leaders vowed to increase disaster aid for victims of the quake that has wreaked more than $ 2 billion in damage. House Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> on Thursday estimated at least $ 2.5 billion in federal funds would be needed to pay for the quake assistance. He said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would vote to provide it in a stopgap money bill that comes up Tuesday. He vowed to come up with the funds but said he did not know where the money would come from. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, a Democrat, had complained that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not visit him during his tour of the region on Wednesday. Agnos accused <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of a `` publicity stunt.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> was invited to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s two meetings with local officials and was offered helicopter transportation to attend them, but rejected the offers. The White House said an initial $ 273 million will be available for the area from a pool of $ 1.1 billion that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated after the devastation caused by Hurricane Hugo.

 More than 10,000 pro-democracy supporters staged a rally in an East German city, opposition leaders said Friday, in the latest sign that activists will keep up the pressure on the country's new leader. Members of the outlawed pro-democracy group New Forum said the rally was held in three churches in the city of <LOCATION> Zittau </LOCATION> Thursday night and thousands also gathered on the city's market square. Loudspeakers were set up so the crowd outside could hear a debate on reform going on in one of the churches, said <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenfelder </PERSON>, a New Forum member in <LOCATION> Zittau </LOCATION>. Communist East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> made its first open appeal to the tens of thousands of citizens who have fled <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in recent months to return home. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Wolfang </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s diplomatic missions would help East Germans return as quickly as possible `` We want to help anyone, unless there are reasons to prevent it, to come back home,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. More than 55,000 East Germans have fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since July. State-run media Friday continued to report critically on economic and political problems. The Communist Party daily <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> devoted four pages to the debate on how to solve the nation's problems `` by improving socialism.'' `` Our -LRB- Communist -RRB- Party is proving that it has the courage to face the truth,'' the newspaper said in a commentary. `` The party has renounced window-dressing and its presumptuousness.'' A West German official, meanwhile, rejected conditions set by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new leader, <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, for the possible loosening of travel for East Germans to the West. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday a new law would be drafted to expand travel rights, but he made it clear that substantial economic and political hurdles stood in the way of letting everyone travel West. Many East Germans say lack of travel freedoms is one of the worst hardships of the tightly controlled society. It has been one of the main causes of the exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans this year to the West. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said the government is drafting a new law that could ultimately ease travel abroad, including to the West, and allow all East Germans to possess a passport. But he said the biggest obstacle to freer travel to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s refusal to recognize East German citizenship. East German leaders say economic problems also pose considerable obstacles, because East Germans need West German currency for the visits. East Germans can not now go to a bank and exchange East German marks for West German ones. <PERSON> Dorothee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilms </PERSON>, who heads <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter-German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> will not change its position on the East German citizenship issue, and said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> already receives millions in hard currency from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilms </PERSON>, in an interview with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television, said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> gets the hard currency through compulsory currency exchange from West German tourists and that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> pays more than $ 270 million a year in connection with transit route agreements alone. `` If East German officials really want to allow their citizens free travel to the West, then they should use some of this money,'' <PERSON> Wilms </PERSON> said. Earlier Friday, <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lueder </PERSON>, a member of West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s ruling coalition, said <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> should not allow <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s apparent readiness to expand travel to the West `` to fail because of money.'' <PERSON> Lueder </PERSON> was quoted in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>'s Express newspaper as saying <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> should allow East Germans to change money at a one-to-one ratio. East German currency is not convertible to Western currency. `` East German tourists would be really helped if they could change between 300 and 500 East German marks for the same sum in West German marks -LRB- $ 162 to $ 270 -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Lueder </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The West German mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and other top Communist leaders met to discuss the refugee problem that has seriously strained the nation's economy. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said the discussion centered on whether to simply let all those who are disenchanted with the system to leave the country in order to `` maintain total Communist Party control.'' The newspaper quoted on official as saying: `` That could be 10 million.'' It said another official responded: `` So what, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> is a prosperous land and only has 6 million.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has a population of about 16.6 million. In <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, officials said Friday about 900 East Germans had crossed from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the last 24 hours. Border guards said the crossings brought to 40,600 the number of East Germans who have crossed into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened its border for the East Germans Sept. 11. Also Friday, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported the Soviet monthy magazine Sputnik will be allowed back into the country after being banned for nearly a year. The magazine was banned after it published several articles critical of Soviet leader <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and questioning the actions of German Communists before the outbreak of World War II. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> took over Wednesday from <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for 18 years.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accused <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on Friday of systematically violating <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace agreements by continuing clandestine efforts to send military equipment to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> made the accusation after <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> security forces found large amounts of weapons which she claimed originated in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and were earmarked for the Salvadoran insurgents, known by the Spanish initials <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. The seizure occurred at a border crossing between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and, according to Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, included AK-47s, rifle grenades, explosives, thousands of rounds of ammunition and <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> instruction manuals. Honduran officials are currently evaluating the facts involved in their seizure, she said. `` There is no doubt, however, that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> regularly, systematically and continually aids, arms and trains the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> thereby remains the principal violator of the Central American peace agreement,'' the spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the command and control of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> continues to operate from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in violation of two agreements signed by five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents, including Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. She added that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, in `` direct contradiction'' of its claims, has continued to send large quantities of weapons to the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> in the 20 months that have passed since American aid to the Nicaraguan Contras was suspended. Honduran military officials have said that the weapons found Wednesday morning were hidden behind false walls in a truck that was carrying furniture from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to an undetermined location in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The seizure was said to have been the largest ever involving a Nicaraguan shipment but no dollar figures were available.

<TEXT>
 An Irishman who was exonerated in an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing after spending 14 years in jail was freed on bail Friday pending his appeal of a separate murder conviction. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was the last of the `` <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> Four'' defendants to be released. The four were serving life sentences for two <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombings that killed five people in 1974 in <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> judge overturned the convictions Thursday, ruling that police probably lied to get them. The government immediately ordered an inquiry into police actions. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 35, was also serving a life sentence for the murder of a British soldier. He was freed on $ 6,500 bail and emerged from the court to cheers from friends and relatives, including his 14-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Cara </PERSON>. `` I am very happy,'' he told a reporter. `` How do you think I feel after 14 years of hell?'' He was flown to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> to begin his appeal of the murder conviction. In the ruling Thursday, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, the Lord Chief Justice, said police officers involved in the investigations that led to the bombing convictions `` must have lied.'' The convictions were upheld in 1977 even though <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members made detailed confessions in the case. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, deputy chief constable of the <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> police force, whose officers handled the original investigation of the <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> Four, said three officers had been suspended pending an inquiry. He identified them as a sergeant and two constables. He said a fourth officer involved, a detective inspector, had died and a fifth, a detective chief inspector, had retired. In addition to <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, the appeals court threw out the convictions of <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, in the bombing of two pubs at <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> on Oct. 5, 1974. It also overturned convictions of <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> in a pub bombing in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Woolwich </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 6, 1974. Two people died in that attack. Irish Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> said Thursday he was satisfied `` the system has the capacity to correct its own mistakes'' in the <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> case, but he said he also believes six Irishmen convicted in <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombings in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> were wrongly convicted. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, the Cabinet member responsible for police, rejected calls to reopen the case of the so-called <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> Six, who were convicted of bombing Nov. 21, 1974. The attacks killed 21 people. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> the case of the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> Six had been examined in the same way as the case of the <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> Four, and with no new evidence emerging, the convictions were sound. In court Thursday, prosecutor <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Amlot </PERSON> disclosed evidence that five officers in the <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> case altered documents, withheld evidence and `` seriously misled the court.'' At their 1975 trial, the <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> Four retracted their so-called confessions, which they said police had beaten out of them. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said the inquiry into police misconduct also will examine the conviction of the so-called Maguire Seven on explosives charges. The defendants include the late father of <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, one of the Guildford Four. A cartoon Friday in The Independent showed <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> staggering from a bomb-wrecked building labeled: `` Criminal Justice System.'' The liberal <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper The Guardian called the incident `` A story filled with shame.''

<HEAD>Officials: New Sanctions Would Penalize Americans Who Do Business
with Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans who do business with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> or any of the more than 30 firms in which he has an interest could face jail terms and $ 500,000 fines under new sanctions being imposed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Friday. Many of the firms are used as intermediaries for trade between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which has been illegal since 1960, the officials said. The move is designed as a deterrent to Cuban efforts to circumvent the trade embargo, while damaging <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s business interests, according to the officials, who asked not to be identified. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> had no comment on the measure, which was first reported in Friday's editions of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. A formal announcement is expected next week. The administration has been groping for ways to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power but has been reluctant to utilize extreme measures, such as a trade embargo, out of concern that hundreds of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> firms in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would go bankrupt. In addition, the harm inflicted on the Panamanian economy would take years to overcome. The new sanction is narrowly targeted at <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his business partners and is not expected to do major damage to the economy as a whole. It is not clear how extensive the business dealings are that Americans have with the firms linked to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has found these firms useful, importing through them high technology U.S.-made items which otherwise would be beyond <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s reach because of the trade embargo. The firms also have served as conduits for illegal Cuban exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the officials said. The administration had begun examining ways to bring new pressure to bear on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> well before the abortive coup attempt on Oct. 3. One move being considered is barring Panamanian-flag vessels from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports. Another is the withholding by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies of certain taxes they pay to the Panamanian government on behalf of their Panamanian employees. Spanish Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> ended a two-day visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday with praise for the restraint President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed in not committing Panama-based <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to the assistance of the rebel officers who tried to overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> earlier this month. `` Interventionism is never desirable,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said through a translator. `` I'm very pleased to know that it has not happened.'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has offered some ideas for resolving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis but he acknowledged that a solution can not be achieved by third countries. `` It should be a Panamanian solution; otherwise there will be no solution,'' he said. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has called for new elections in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and for the newly elected leadership to have the authority to name a new <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> commander to replace <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be allowed to remain in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and thus would remain out of the reach of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement authorities. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> believes that a solution to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis would be eased if less attention is devoted to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s personal fate and more toward achieving the democratic rule blocked by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s theft of an election earlier this year

 Typewriters clattered in newsrooms again this week as newspapers around <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> scrambled to publish after the earthquake darkened computer screens and silenced presses. When the quake struck, newspapers from <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> were forced to improvise to publish special editions, at times resorting to writing by longhand in the flickering light of candles. `` The sound of the old manual typewriter was heard in the newsroom for the first time in a million years,'' said <PERSON> Reg </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, editor of The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, without power, was able to publish an earthquake special edition that hit <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> streets Wednesday night by arranging to print at a weekly paper's plant in <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 50 miles to the south. A team was sent to <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to produce the 12-page special edition. Reporters wrote by hand and typewriter with candles burning at their sides. `` I was very proud of what we did,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>. `` It was a very, very trying experience.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> Register-Pajaronian, said Friday that in the first hours following the quake he could n't reach his reporters because phone lines were out in the area, which was close to the epicenter At daybreak, reporters spread across their territory then returned to the powerless office to write on battery-powered laptop computers in sunlight from the front window. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> made arrangements to print at the Register's sister paper, the Telegram-Tribune, 160 miles south in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>. The laptop stories were sent over phone lines to laptops at the <ORGANIZATION> Telegram-Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, then transferred to that paper's main computer and edited. A private plane flew the newspapers to <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, where they reached the streets just after 6 p.m. Wednesday. The `` long, arduous process'' was worth it, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said, because readers were hungry for news. More than 15,000 copies of the eight-page edition, without ads, were quickly snapped up. The Register-Pajaronian was nearly back to normal and produced a 24-page edition Friday, he said. `` We had a hairy day on Wednesday, but rule No. 1 in this business is you always publish,'' said <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> used generators to put out Wednesday morning's eight-page edition, produced on Apple Macintosh computers. The afternoon Examiner also used generators, flashlights and Macintoshes to get out the news. Both published full editions Friday with most of their regular sections. Tossing aside traditional rivalry, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> helped the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sentinel </LOCATION> publish a 12-page special edition by 8 p.m. Wednesday. The Sentinel, a morning paper, sent editors and darkroom and composing workers 25 miles to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> for the editions published Wednesday through Friday evenings. The Sentinel hoped to resume morning editions by Sunday. Editor <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> praised the Mercury News for its cooperation. `` We're impressed. They were really great. They were really helpful,'' said <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>. `` They were a class operation.'' Some newspapers were lucky, such as The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Aarons </PERSON>, senior vice president for news, said the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> survived the quake with its electricity intact. The computers were quickly revived. The morning Tribune was able to put out a complete edition on schedule, said <PERSON> Aarons </PERSON>. The paper printed 206,000 papers, some 60,000 more than normal. The Mercury News also came out on time, printing 100,000 extra copies the morning after the quake.

 <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, removed on Friday from his federal judgeship, can run for governor of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> if he chooses. But he ca n't run for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or the House of Representatives. The Constitution says so. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> announced immediately after his conviction by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on eight articles of impeachment that he would run for governor of his state. The Constitution specifies that conviction by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> includes `` disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' That refers to federal, not state office. The impeachment clause of the Constitution gives the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> `` the sole power of impeachment'' _ to bring charges against a president, vice president and `` all civil officers of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The power to try the individuals on these charges is given to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. It is the only means by which federal judges, who hold their office for life, can be removed from the bench. The word impeach means to accuse. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> votes to impeach, when it adopts articles of impeachment. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> then conducts a trial on these issues and if the accused is convicted, he is said to have been impeached. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was convicted of perjury and conspiracy to obtain a $ 150,000 payoff. He is the sixth official removed from office after trial. Only one president, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, has ever been tried by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and he escaped conviction by one vote. In <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s case, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted three articles of impeachment against <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, but the president resigned before the matter could be brought before the full House. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> stepped down after he was told by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders that his conviction in any trial was certain.

<TEXT>
 Lawyers can use evidence about bus safety to fight the 27 murder charges their client faces from last year's bus-crash disaster, a judge ruled Friday But the prosecution can use results of blood alcohol tests to prove <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was drunk when he rammed his pickup into the bus carrying a church youth group, <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> also ruled that photographs of the victims can be used by the prosecution to illustrate a large bus seating chart, but that the jury can not be shown pictures of the victims' burned bodies. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 36, is charged in the deaths of three adults and 24 children and teen-agers who were killed in the May 14, 1988, crash, one of the nation's worst bus disasters. His trial is to begin Nov. 8 Police said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was driving in the wrong direction on Interstate 71 southwest of <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION> when his truck collided with the bus, which burst into flames. One adult and 39 youths escaped, some with severe injuries. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s attorneys had made clear their intention to base his defense on the condition of the bus _ a school bus bought as surplus by <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of God church. Special Prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> opposed that, but the judge sided with the defense team. He also rejected the defense's attempt to bar the use of multiple blood-alcohol tests conducted on <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> within hours of the crash. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s lawyers had argued that blood samples were illegally obtained and that test results were unreliable. Observers of the case have said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s sole hope at trial may be in trying to show that safety defects, not his wayward driving, were ultimately responsible for the deaths. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the probable cause of the accident was <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s `` alcohol-impaired condition.'' But it added that contributing to the accident's severity was the puncturing of the bus' fuel tank and the resulting fire, as well as its flammable seat cushions and bench seats that partly blocked the rear emergency door The <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> medical examiner found that all 27 deaths were due to smoke inhalation and that no one on board was seriously injured by the crash impact.

 Who needs the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilduff </PERSON> around to keep an eye on woolly worms. The <LOCATION> Beattyville </LOCATION> woman Friday predicted in an annual survey that winter in central <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> will have an early kick and a late bite, because the fuzzy caterpillars were mostly black on the ends and brown in the middle. This is the eighth year Mrs. <PERSON> Kilduff </PERSON> has conducted her woolly worm survey, also taking into account other Appalachian folk signs to make her winter predictions. About 250 people called Mrs. <PERSON> Kilduff </PERSON> during the four-week survey to report 1,423 woolly worms were black on the ends and brown in the middle; 52 were solid black; 82 were light colored; and 11 were white, she said. In addition, there were 25 local foggy mornings in August, three hornets' nests seen very low to the ground and three persimmon seeds with spoon-like structures in the middle. `` So we would predict from the woolly worms that our winters would be cold on each end and mild in the middle and that it will snow but that the snow wo n't lay on because the hornets' nests are close to the ground,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kilduff </PERSON> said. The height of the hornets' nests indicate the height of snow _ the higher the nests the deeper the snow, Mrs. <PERSON> Kilduff </PERSON> said. The shape of the persimmon seeds generally indicate snow, and the color of the woolly worms predicts the severity of winter, she said. August fog tells her how many snowy days winter will have. Mrs. <PERSON> Kilduff </PERSON> said her forecasts are `` remarkably accurate.'' Last year, she predicted a milder than usual winter that proved to be true, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecaster <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. Radio stations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> called Mrs. <PERSON> Kilduff </PERSON> this week to discuss her predictions. National Geographic magazine sent a photographer and writer to cover this weekend's Woolly Worm festival that will include a woolly worm race.

 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday convicted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of perjury and conspiracy to obtain a $ 150,000 payoff, making him the sixth federal official in the naton's history removed from office by impeachment `` I have no choice but to accept their judgment,'' said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, pausing in a drizzle on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> steps as he left the chamber. He maintained his innocence, called the trial unfair, pledged to run for governor of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and said he would resume the practice of law. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, 53, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s first black federal district judge, was acquitted of the bribery-conspiracy charges in a criminal trial six years ago. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sealed his fate when it voted 69-26 to convict him on the first of 17 articles of impeachment, charging him with conspiracy to obtain a bribe. In two hours of back-to-back roll calls, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> found him guilty on eight of the articles, acquitted him on three and waived action on six. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tempore <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, announced the results and declared that `` it is therefore ordered that the said <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> be and is hereby removed'' from the office for which he was paid $ His ouster followed by three years a similar action against Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, the fifth official ever removed in an impeachment case. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is nearing final action on impeachment charges against Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a free man, facing no prison sentence and with no criminal acquitted on his record. The impeachment trial was not designed to reverse the verdict of the jury that acquitted him in 1983 but to remove him from the bench. For that reason, his accusers scoffed at <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' frequent complaint that he was a victim of `` double jeopardy'' because he had already been acquitted n court of the same charges. `` Do you then not take the matter up and then let a judge serve who you know is guilty of bribery?'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told a news conference following the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s action. The articles of impeachment had been prepared by the House. `` This is n't a case of double jeopardy,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. He said that was so because `` we are sitting in a separate forum with separate standards of proof.'' But he voted to acquit <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> on all articles of impeachment. `` The evidence presented was not clear and convincing,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> watched at a table on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor throughout the first roll call while defense attorney <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> kept a tally. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> showed the results to <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> before they were announced and they shook hands. A moment later, defense attorney <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> friend, left the chamber. She was soon followed by <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` I'm upbeat and can go forward with my life ...,'' he told reporters. `` There are those of you who would say I should be banished in infamy. I know nothing in my life that requires that.'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was accused of plotting with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON>, once a prominent <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney, to obtain a bribe from two brothers, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, who each were facing three-year fraud sentences imposed by <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. Borders was arrested Oct. 9, 1981, while driving from a suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> motel with an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent posing as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> and a garment bag containing $ 125,000 in cash. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a testimonial dinner in honor of Borders that night, was told that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> wanted to question him but instead quickly returned to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> by an indirect route without checking out of his hotel. Borders later served a prison sentence in the matter and was to be released Friday from jail, where he had been held for contempt of court for refusing to testify in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted Friday of one count of perjury, which he had been chraged with in telling the jury he had not expected Borders to appear in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel room Sept. 12, 1981. His accusers said the hotel room meeting was part of the conspircay. In an anticlimax, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acquitted him, 95-0, of a charge that in an unrelated case he improperly disclosed information obtained from a court-authorized wiretap under his supervision. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also acquitted him of an omnibus or `` catchall'' charge that he had acted improperly or given `` the appearance of impropriety.'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said that what `` the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has said is a standard of almost proven, innuendo and inference is good enough to remove a judge or executive officer by way of impeachment. That is chilling and fraught with potential to do a lot of harm.'' He said he was `` hopeful that some book offers will come along.'' `` There are so many wonderful and tragic stories that are born of this saga. They need to be told and tell them I shall.''

 <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>, among the hardest-hit neighborhoods in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s gigantic 1906 earthquake, appeared to be one of the luckier ones this time. `` I was absolutely surprised that <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> did n't have serious damage Tuesday,'' city Supervisor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsieh </PERSON> said Friday. `` But the damage could be hidden from the surface.'' The teeming neighborhood of narrow streets crowded with restaurants, food markets and souvenir shops covers about a mile-square area near <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and the Financial District. It is home to about 40,000 people. <PERSON> Hsieh </PERSON> said that he plans to introduce legislation at the board of supervisors meeting Monday which would require thorough inspection of unreinforced masonry buildings in the city. He estimates there are at least 1,000 such buildings, mostly in <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> and the Tenderloin, housing about 10,000 people. `` They were built with bricks in the old days with no reinforcement bars inside. The bricks were put together with sand and some kind of plaster mixture which has no structure capacity. `` The buildings somehow survived. But between the bricks, the mortar might be totally deteriorated, and if there are additional shakes, we may see major collapses of these unreinforced buildings.'' <PERSON> Hsieh </PERSON>, of Chinese ancestry, is the city's first supervisor of Asian background. He also is a former architect. Some of the older buildings in <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> predate the 1906 quake. The district is one of the most densely populated in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It was badly damaged in 1906 but not flattened altogether,'' <PERSON> Hsieh </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, some bricks were shaken off buildings and onto the streets and some windows were broken. Most of the damage was inside shops and restaurants, whose employees loaded trashcans with the remains of glassware, <LOCATION> china </LOCATION> vases and other items. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, who served <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> crispy chicken and butterfly prawns during last fall's presidential campaign, was still out of business Friday because of an empty refrigerator at his Empress of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> restaurant. `` We had to throw -LRB- food -RRB- out and reorder,'' <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> said. The Empress of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> opened for dinner at 5 o'clock on Tuesday and the first two customers had just been seated when the earthquake hit. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> and his employees spent the next day cleaning up broken liquor bottles, dishes and glasses. `` All the bottles at the bar fell and a lot in our storeroom were broken. But the food -LRB- lost -RRB- was more expensive than than the liquor,'' <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> said. `` I do n't have any damage estimate yet.'' <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON>, proprietor of a coffee shop and bakery down the street, stayed open with the help of candlelight for several hours and sold out his supply of pastry. `` People were buying everything. They did n't know if they'd be able to get anything to eat the next day. I heard that some places charged higher prices after the earthquake. We did n't do that,'' <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> said. `` I did n't do that. `` I was just happy that we were all right, and I wanted to help people.'' <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> did not lose gas service, so was able to continue cooking pastry Wednesday and Thursday. Most of <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> did not get electic power restored until Thursday afternoon.

<TEXT>
 A couple who lured consumers to visit time-share resorts with false promises of expensive prizes pleaded guilty Friday to charges of defrauding creditors of more than $ 1 million. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFusco </PERSON>, 34, and his 28-year-old wife, <PERSON> Annette </PERSON>, admitted to a bankruptcy fraud conspiracy in guilty pleas that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said `` ends the story of a very charmed life led by those two individuals.'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said the couple used phantom corporations and aliases to hide money frozen in bankruptcy proceedings from creditors who claim unpaid debts of $ 2.5 million from the DeFusco's and their companies. The couple had `` every kind of luxury item you could imagine,'' including eight mink coats, a Rolls <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> and two <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> automobiles, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. After the trustee ordered liquidation of their assets last spring, the DeFuscos sold two cars and moved $ 250,000 worth of personal possessions to <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and opened another business under assumed names, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who raided their <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> home on July 5 found jewelry, furs, a Persian rug worth $ 15,000, and art work valued at more than $ 10,000, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. The search also uncovered a well-worn copy of a book entitled `` How to Create a New Identity'' that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said was `` the Bible'' of the DeFusco's business operations. `` They became masters of deceit.'' DeFusco, who pleaded guilty Oct. 6 in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to fraud charges stemming from the operation of the couple's direct-mail advertising company, admitted diverting $ 1 million worth of corporate and personal assets that had been frozen by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy trustee. Mrs. <PERSON> DeFusco </PERSON>, who was sobbing as she appeared before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>, admitted diverting $ 290,000 worth of assets as part of the scheme with her husband. Each could be sentenced to 25 years in prison and fined up to $ 750,000 for guilty pleas to conspiracy to conceal assets from a bankruptcy trustee and money laundering. <PERSON> DeFusco </PERSON> also faces a possible 10-year term for his fraud convictions in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> told reporters the DeFusco's had lived in a $ 1 million house in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, with a gardner, maid and a nanny. They often dined twice a week a an expensive <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> restaurant where the bill was $ 250. Their creditors claim $ 2.5 million in unpaid bills, including $ 60,000 for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> credit-card charges to buy jewelry, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. The couple mailed millions of pieces of advertising that promised prizes ranging from televisions to imported cars to people if they drove hundreds of miles to visit time-share condominium resorts, prosecutors have said. In earlier guilty plea, <PERSON> DeFusco </PERSON> admitted conspiring with <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to lure residents from <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> states to visit time-share resorts in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has filed suit to seek an injunction barring the DeFuscos from continuing the mailings. Defense attorney <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> disagreed with <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s description of his cleints `` This is n't a situation where two people set to out see how much theycould steal,'' he said. `` They are people who have been successful in business for a time,'' he said. `` In 1986, they started to have problems of money owed to the postal authorities.'' `` They got on a treadmill'' trying to pay off the $ 240,000 owed to the Postal Service for mailing costs, <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> said. He accused <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wortham </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, of competing `` to see who is going to get the first press conference'' about the case. As part of the plea agreement, federal prosecutors in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> agreed not to press fraud charges stemming from the DeFusco's operation of another marketing company The couple also agreed to help investigators trace assets that are still missing.

<HEAD>Children of Pennsylvania Impressionist Lose Family Treasures</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BERWYN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Art thieves who knew what they wanted picked their way through the home of a collector who lost in excess of $ 500,000 in <LOCATION> china </LOCATION>, a crystal chandelier and 19 impressionist paintings by his late father. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, called in after the theft last month, termed the initial half-million dollar loss figure extremely conservative. Among the items lost in the heist was the masterpiece `` Meet at White Horse,'' an impressionist view of horses and hounds gathering for the hunt, by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who left his best works to his children. The art was stolen from the home of <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Brinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Coxe </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, in the nearby community of <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> sometime between Sept. 7 and Sept. 14. The thieves also packed up 20 paintings by other artists, a rare Waterford crystal chandelier worth as much as $ 100,000, family jewelry and silver, <LOCATION> china </LOCATION>, antique furniture and Oriental rugs, police said. Among the family treasures reported missing was a gold sealing ring that once belonged to <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON>, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and an ancestor of <PERSON> Brinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> on his mother's side. The thieves were well-informed, police said. They knew what they wanted and were aware that the family was not expected home for some time. For example, the burglars searched through a large china cabinet but took only a set of original blue-and-white <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> plates, leaving behind some <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> copies, according to <LOCATION> Tredyffrin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> police detective <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>. `` This is n't like stealing a car or a stereo,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said this week. `` It's a narrow market and art thieves are a narrow and esoteric group. They are not your normal smash-and-grabbers.'' The elder <PERSON> Young </PERSON> was a student and award-winning artist at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, which owns four of his paintings. He also studied at <ORGANIZATION> Colarossi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and enjoyed some international acclaim. His paintings won medals and were exhibited in shows and gallleries across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and also in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s reputation is not widespread, it is only because so many of his paintings have been lost, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, director of development for the <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Griswold </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lyme </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, which owns some of Young's work. A fire in 1962 at the elder Young's home in <LOCATION> Radnor </LOCATION>, a posh <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb known for its fox hunt, destroyed 185 of his paintings. He was able to repaint a few of his best pieces before he died two years later at the age of 95. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, an authority on <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s paintings, said that the artist `` was a very skeptical person'' who did not like to give his work to anyone but those closest to him. `` There's no reason in the world he could not have had a national audience were he more widely exhibited,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kundts </PERSON> said the original $ 500,000 estimate of the loss was `` an extremely conservative figure.'' An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Friday that there were no new developments in the case. `` The money does n't matter,'' said <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Osterhout </PERSON>, wife of <PERSON> Brinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and close friend and biographer of her late father-in-law. `` It's the fact that the beauty is gone.'' She is contacting art galleries, publications and organizations to alert members of the art community that the paintings have been stolen. `` We're going to get them back,'' <PERSON> Osterhout </PERSON> said. `` We've got to get them back.'' Most of the stolen paintings were 20 inches by 24 inches, or 30 inches by 40 inches, as is `` Meet at White Horse.'' The smallest, called `` Rose Tree Hunt,'' is six inches by eight inches.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that <PERSON> Lamia </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sausage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, is voluntarily recalling all of its meat products because they may contain high levels of sulfites. The company sells some products across the counter in its <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> retail store, but most products are distributed to restaurants in nearby areas in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said no illnesses have been reported but that consumers and other purchasers should `` immediately return any products produced by the company.'' The recalled products include: <PERSON> Lamia </PERSON>'s Spedini's, bratwurst, Italian sausage with cheese, Italian sausage with beef and tomato sauce, Italian sausage -LRB- pork -RRB-, ground beef patties, ground beef, and Italia Brand Beef Patty Mix. Products can be identified further by the establishment code `` Est. 13000'' inside the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> inspection seal. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said that because of the high levels of sulfites found during testing, sulfite-sensitive consumers could become seriously ill or even die. `` Sulfites are not permitted as direct additives in meat or poultry because the chemical can mask spoilage,'' he said. But sulfites may enter processed meat and poultry products if vegetables used as ingredients have been treated with the chemical at safe levels, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. To alert consumers, the word `` sulfites'' must be included in the ingredients statement on the package. However, he said, the levels of sulfites detected in <PERSON> Lamia </PERSON>'s meat samples greatly exceeded levels considered to be safe

Further, the placement of new cattle and calves on feed during the third quarter of the year totaled 5.69 million head, down 5 percent from last year and 14 percent from two years ago. Cattle feeders indicated they expect to market 5.37 million head in October, November and December, down 2 percent from last year's fourth quarter and 4 percent below 1987, the report said State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the 13 states, which account for about 85 percent of the nation's beef. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Oct. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

 A visit from the archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> is the highlight of bicentennial festivities this weekend for the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> branch of the world's second-largest Christian denomination. The itinerary for the Most Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A.K </PERSON>. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, spiritual head of the world's 70 million Anglicans, included celebration of the Eucharist at the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the Saviour on Friday night, followed by a banquet at Memorial Hall in the city's <LOCATION> Fairmount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> will also speak at a Sunday service at <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> attended services. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> was invited to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, sponsor of a conference held since Wednesday on the founding of the Domestic and <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1789. During two sessions that summer and fall in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, American church leaders adopted a prayer book and a constitution that gave shape to doctrine, discipline and worship. According to the Diocese of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s remarks at Friday's banquet were expected to touch on the founding of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the first free and independent Anglican church outside the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isles </LOCATION>. Today the Anglican Communion includes 28 national or regional churches in 164 countries. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s visit follows by three weeks his first official visit to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, where he and Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> signed a document committing the Anglican and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches to heal their 450-year-old split. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and Anglican officials have been holding talks since 1966 on unifying their churches. The estrangement began when King <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON> formed his own church after the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> refused to grant him an annulment of his marriage to <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> of <PERSON> Aragon </PERSON>. Among major points separating the churches are the ordination of women, which the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and some other Anglican churches permit, and the doctrine of papal infallibility, which applies to Roman Catholic beliefs such as the Immaculate Conception of the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and her assumption to heaven after death. The <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, during a recent meeting in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, affirmed the ordained ministry of women while calling for sensitivity toward those who believe women should not be ordained. The bishops' statement welcomed Suffragan Bishop <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the first female bishop in the Anglican Communion, but said those within Anglicanism who oppose the ordination of women `` hold a recognized theological position.'' <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s visit coincides with the Diocese of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s annual diocesan convention Friday through Sunday The 73,000-member diocese includes 169 parishes and missions in the five-county <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area.

 Legislation enabling <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to receive extra emergency highway funds for repairing the collapsed Bay Bridge and other federal highways was introduced Friday with one senator saying he wanted to know why a section of Interstate 880 gave way in Tuesday's earthquake. Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, introduced the bill, which would waive the $ 100 million cap on emergency highway funds for a single disaster and allow the money to be used on the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, which would normally be ineligible for such emergency relief because it is a toll facility. The emergency highway-aid fund currently has $ 219 million, consisting of this year's $ 100 million authorization and a $ 119 million carryover from previous years. Highway money also exists in a $ 10 billion highway trust fund financed by user fees and fuel and tire taxes, but that money is not available for emergency highway aid. <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> is the ranking member and former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on water resources, transportation and infrastructure. The subcommittee is chaired by Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, D-N.Y. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said he would like to hold hearings `` to ask the necessary question, ` Why was it that a 60-story skyscraper survived this event event in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> without any damage of any kind, and two-story highways collapsed?'' `` The interstate system is now in effect completed. ... but we also observe that there are portions that fall down more readily than they ought, that do not withstand the shocks that we can obviously provide for,'' he said. `` If we do it in a 60-story building, we can do it a two-story concrete highway. We want to know about that.'' Engineers and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials have said the two-level highway, which had been strengthened, should have been able to withstand the quake.

 Patrolman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fappiana </PERSON>'s job these days is tracking down reports of people missing and feared dead in the rubble of the collapsed Cypress overpass on Interstate 880. In the first 2 -LCB- hours after the quake hit Tuesday at 5:04 p.m., he learned first-hand what it's like to fear that a loved-one may have been killed in an earthquake. `` My wife does travel on that section of the freeway, and she gets off at 5,'' <PERSON> Fappiana </PERSON> said Friday. `` She was two blocks away when it came down. I was watching a station that did n't have verbal communication with the helicopter showing the pictures, but I knew that was the Cyrpess structure that had come down. `` I waited 2 -LCB- hours in front of the TV'til she came home.'' Ten police officers make telephone calls every four hours around the clock to those who have made missing persons reports to find out if people have turned up. By Friday afternoon, a total of 242 people had been reported missing in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> at some point in connection with the earthquake, said Sgt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, who heads the missing persons office. Of those, 145 were later located, including seven dead whose next of kin have been notified. He said that left 97 missing, all of whom had a chance of driving on Interstate 880 when a mile-long section of the double-decker freeway collapsed, trapping cars in the rubble. Other police reports have put the number missing as high as 167. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said about 80 of those were reported from the beginning and 15 or 20 represent more recent reports. One of the missing is <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, a deputy district attorney for <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. She left her office, located next to the freeway, on Tuesday afternoon for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> airport to pick up some relatives, and has n't been heard from since, said Senior Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` They found some cars and one of them looked like hers,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` We're hoping for the best, but who knows?'' <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Zambetti </PERSON>, 27, a sales manager for <ORGANIZATION> Stella </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D'Oro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biscuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leandro </LOCATION>, is also missing. `` He left work at 12 minutes to five on the earthquake day heading for the city,'' plant manager <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarco </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. `` Two hours later, I started hearing about the Cypress overpass collapsing. `` Right now, I am on pins and needles waiting to hear,'' he said. `` We've just hired somebody who is going to sit in his apartment for the next 24 or 48 hours in case someone calls, in case he calls.'' <PERSON> Fappiana </PERSON> said that as many as a dozen wrecked cars towed away from the freeway had no bodies in them. `` It's totally amazing,'' said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. `` I ca n't understand it, unless some people had some pre-warning and were able to abandon their cars. `` We have not had anybody calling us back to say, ` I made it out of my car,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. He added that the count has been complicated by the fact that some of the dead who have been identified were never reported missing. That's why police are regularly calling everyone who has made a report. `` It's not like an air crash, where people are international,'' said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. `` You have people, working stiffs, living in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> or the ity -LRB- <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> -RRB-. `` There's a lot of people close to home,'' he said. <PERSON> Danna </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabella </PERSON>, division director of children's placement services for <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, has been running a volunteer hotline for people asking about loved ones. She was so busy after the earthquake, she never called her husband, who was on a business trip in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, to let him know she was safe. `` He called me at 3 in the morning and absolutely cried,'' she said. `` I said I was sorry, but I knew I was OK. I just did n't think he would be worried.

 Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> joined gray-haired alumni and fifth-graders in Pilgrim outfits Friday to mark the 350th anniversary of the nation's oldest free school _ made new for its birthday by an infusion of renovation funds. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said the refurbishing of <ORGANIZATION> Mather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where morale had sagged as graffiti and other scars multiplied in the past decade, `` speaks to the way our nation is getting together to address our education deficit.'' The school was founded in 1639 as a one-room boys' school with a grass roof. It flourished, moving five times to accommodate its growing enrollment. But in 1974, federal orders to desegregate <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> schools through busing contributed to a middle-class exodus to the suburbs, and the school's condition deteriorated. It took a new principal and the looming anniversary to get the $ 1.2 million renovation under way. Friday, the new <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> was polished and humming, equipped with a set of gleaming windows, a new playground out front to greet the visitors and a refurbished auditorium. `` I think this shows that when we put the resources there, the system can work,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, who said he hoped to do the same for every school in the city. Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who over the past year has struggled with a state budget shortfall that has forced him to cut back state school aid, reminded the audience that improvements in schools have a price. `` Taxes, tuitions, those funds for this school did n't come out of the air,'' the governor said. `` We've got to decide just how important schools are. And the real work has just begun.'' To many 600 alumni and others on hand, however, taxes and renovation seemed beside the point as they greeted old friends and students they had not seen in decades. `` I would n't miss this for the world,'' said <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassinari </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrail </PERSON>, who taught French at Mather from 1941 to 1953. `` Many of my students are here now.'' Nearby, a group of gray-haired men and women in tweed exclaimed over a yellowed picture of the class of 1932, pointing out their younger selves. The photographs, where white faces stare out in sepia tones, portrayed another facet of the major changes at Mather. Fifteen years after the school was ordered to integrate, 80 percent of the student body is black and Hispanic. `` We are now truly a worldwide school,'' said Principal <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. `` This diversity makes us vibrant and strong, but it also puts us on the front lines of what's happening in the community.'' On stage, the students showed the audience how much <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> had altered. Four classes of fifth - and sixth-graders sat on chairs wearing placards with flags from such countries as <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to proclaim the lands their ancestors inhabited 350 years ago One of those attending was <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>, 81, who graduated from <LOCATION> Mather </LOCATION> in 1921, and whose daughter, <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON>, teaches remedial math there. <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON> said she came to the school because it had an opening, but she considered her mother's attendance there a bonus. `` It's exciting that I'm in the same school -LRB- my mother -RRB- was,'' said <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON>, 44. `` A few weeks ago, I was in a room where all the old records were, for attendance and such, and I looked up her records. It made me really happy.''

<HEAD>State Department Praises Warsaw Pact Inspection Proposal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday praised a proposal by the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> on military inspections in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and said it was close to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s approach. However, at least two major differences over reducing troops and weapons surfaced. The Soviets and their six allies called for limits on military budgets and a freeze on modernizing military airfields and bases, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, they said it was practically impossible to make accurate comparisons between military spending on the two sides. And, the officials said, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> needs to be able to improve its installations. A current example is altering a base in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in order to deploy F-16 jet fighters being transferred from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` You do n't want to find yourself down the road with your physical plants run down,'' an official told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's acceptance of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> idea of permanent inspections of military installations, including key transit points, could also cause friction within the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Two key members, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, are opposed to the concept promoted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and now the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which made its presentation Thursday at negotiations in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The negotiations, involving 23 countries, are designed to reduce troops, tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear weapons across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. A priority issue is how to verify current levels of troops and weapons and then reductions under a treaty President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has predicted will be completed by May. The president has called for a ceiling of 275,000 on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops in the area. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposed last summer that the two alliances be limited to 20,000 tanks, 16,500 artillery pieces and 3,800 aircraft. The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> has not offered a formal response, but Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has indicated on several occasions he favored across-the-board reductions in the non-nuclear armaments deployed on the two sides of the East-West divide. The pact called for permanent inspection of military facilities, including transit points; short-notice, random checks that could not be blocked; and restraints on military exercises. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, reacting to the overall <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> position, said, `` The East proposals on verification appear to be based on the concepts that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> presented. We are pleased that the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact approach to verification appears to parallel that of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>.''

<TEXT>
 An international conference on endangered species Friday rejected a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to limit export of elephant tusks classified as hunting trophies. The 91-nation conference ended its meeting after adding 60 types of orchids, the salmon-crested cockatoo and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> flying fox to the list of species threatened with extinction. But while the Convention on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in Endangered Species considered proposals to mark as threatened more than 200 animals and plants during its meeting, its main concern was the world's rapidly declining elephant population. On Monday, the convention put the elephant on the endangered species list and with that approved a ban on trade in ivory. On Friday, it rejected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to set quotas for the tusks, a move that would have allowed a maximum 750 elephants to be killed every year for sport as opposed to commercial trade purposes. Such a quota would have allowed big-game hunters to take the prized tusks home. In the absence of international rules, federal legislation in several countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, will outlaw hunting trophies under the conference's ban on ivory trade. A member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation said the proposal was designed to help wildlife management. The delegate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said many countries still will permit the import of hunting trophies and that the proposal would have limited the number of elephants killed for sport. <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Mushanana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nchunga </PERSON>, calling for rejection of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal, said: `` It's strange that the same people who have pushed for an ivory ban are saying it's OK to hunt elephants for sport ... OK to decorate the house with tusks but not for a woman to wear ivory earrings.'' The ban on ivory sales goes into effect Jan. 18. It covers trade in elephant tusks, skins and meat and all existing stocks of ivory, most of them in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, where Asians in particular covet ivory. However, countries can get around the convention rulings by filing for exemptions and several southern <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries _ including <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> _ have indicated they will do so because they consider their elephant management programs a success. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> already has formally requested one and South African chief delegate <PERSON> Pieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> was `` swaying toward'' asking for an exemption. Under convention rules, this would allow them to sell ivory to member countries that also have exemptions and to more than 60 countries outside the convention. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the world's biggest market for ivory, has not said whether it will request an exemption. The conference decided Friday to hold its 1992 conference in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Military Command Rejects Rebel Purge Demand as `Ridiculous'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The entire military command met with journalists Friday and declared that a demand by leftist rebels for a purge of the armed forces was `` ridiculous and impossible.'' Rebel leaders contend the commanders are corrupt and implicated in human rights abuses. The unusual gathering of the defense minister, air force commander, chief of the joint chiefs of staff and commanders of all brigades and battalions _ two generals and 35 colonels in all _ reaffirmed a rejection of the idea Thursday by President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. `` We feel it appropriate to provide a strong, clear, united response to the proposal made by the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Larios </PERSON>, the defense minister. He described the rebel demand that he and 16 other top commanders be remoed as `` absurd, ridiculous and impossible.'' Representatives of the rightist government and the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla alliance, ended three days of peace talks Wednesday in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. No substantive accord was reached, but they agreed to another meeting next month. An estimated 70,000 people have been killed, most of them civilians, since the civil war began 10 years ago. In a nationally broadcast address Thursday, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> also called the purge demand `` ridiculous.'' He accused the rebels of using the talks `` tactically'' in an effort to isolate the government and divide the armed forces. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> has not demonstrated the political will to want to achieve peace,'' said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. `` It refuses to talk about a cessation of hostilities. Its entire attitude is one of provocation.'' He said it was `` totally absurd'' for the guerrillas to demand that any cease-fire agreement recognize their control of territory and stipulate that <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges be replaced. `` We recognize the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> is a reality, that it exists, but it is a small reality and can not oblige the government to change the republic's constitutional system,'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said. Guerrilla forces control a swath of northern and eastern <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and are present to some degree in all 14 provinces. The rebels say the government's insistence on an immediate cessation of hostilities without agreement on eventual reforms is a disguised call for surrender.

 Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> celebrated the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s vote Friday to oust <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> from the bench by sipping champagne and eating pizza. `` The rewarding feeling I have is that a complicated and controversial case ended with justice being done,'' said <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as the chief prosecutor in <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial. `` I feel 100 percent certain that he was guilty and clearly should not be serving as a federal judge.'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said he expects the former federal judge to campaign against him as he seeks the Democratic nomination for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> attorney general. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, the first black <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court judge in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said he would do so during a recent meeting in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> with a coalition of black Democratic leaders, where he also complained he was being unfairly prosecuted by <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> congressman said in an interview. But <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, said black voters should not hold <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>'s role in the case against him. Hooks said that since all but three members of the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> voted to impeach <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, `` it's difficult to say that because a white man took part, he should be singled out ...'' Hooks said one of those congressmen supporting <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' impeachment was Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Democrat who `` no one can say is soft on positions affecting black people. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, meanwhile, said he feels vindicated by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s vote to convict <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of perjury and conspiracy to obtain a $ 150,000 payoff, making the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> judge the sixth federal official removed as a result of impeachment. `` I was not certain what the verdict would be at any stage, because of the fact that it was a case that involved a previous acquital of the judge on one of the central charges,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. `` Of course it also involved a conviction of his co-conspirator for conspiring with the judge to extort a bribe. `` So you had contradictory jury verdicts, making the matter legally complicated. And then you had a very complex set of facts ... requiring the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to make a decision based on strong but circumstantial evidence,'' said <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, 53, was acquitted of the bribery-conspiracy charges in a criminal trial six years ago. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said he feels good about having fulfilled his responsibility. `` I was asked to take this role -LRB- by Judiciary Chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- and I knew it would be extremely controversial and time consuming,'' he said.

 The estimated cost of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s deadly earthquake rose to $ 5.5 billion Friday as state officials received new reports of damage to businesses, public buildings, homes and state highways and bridges The pricetag of the disaster continues to grow and does n't include losses on many county roads left cracked from Tuesday's quake that measured 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> `` The damage estimate is going up constantly as we get new reports,'' <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON> said. `` We wo n't know the total damage for quite a while.'' So far, <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is estimating at least $ 1.3 billion in losses in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> alone, while figures for the other parts of the county which escaped with far less damage were n't immediately calculated.

 Scientists converged on the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> on Friday to look for the origins of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s killer earthquake as mountain residents resumed life in the fault zone. Geologists were investigating whether a fissure hundreds of yards long and as wide as 20 inches in some spots was in fact the result of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION> rupturing to the surface. `` The question we're trying to answer is whether that break is the primary fault or something else,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Fumal </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. Seismologists believe the infamous fault's southern <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> segment was responsible for Tuesday's disastrous 6.9-magnitude quake. But doubts have been raised by their difficulty finding where the fault broke through to the surface of the ground. Finding the surface trace of the fault is important because it would confirm the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> indeed caused the quake. A 1988 <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> report said the fault's <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> segment had a 30 percent chance of causing a strong quake within 30 years. If it turns out that Tuesday's quake was caused by some fault other than the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION>, that risk likely would remain unchanged. If the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> did cause the quake, severe quakes on that segment of the fault would be less likely in coming decades. By Friday afternoon, state geologists found fissures caused by seismic ground settling. But they failed to turn up evidence that the underground rupture of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> had broken to the surface of the ground, said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanery </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Division of Mines and Geology in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. Tuesday's major quake should have caused ground on one side of the fault to slip past the ground on the other side by at least several inches to a few feet. But such `` offset'' was found only on two cracked roads near the epicenter, and it totaled only a couple of inches, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Streitz </PERSON>, a geologist with the state. The aftershock zone from Tuesday's quake stretches from the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> reservoir south of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION> southward some 25 miles to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bautista </LOCATION>, so the fault could have broken through to the surface along that line, <PERSON> Streitz </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said the actual fault rupture causing the quake probably occurred as deep as 12 miles underground. He said it is possible the breakage might not migrate upward, or might take weeks to reach the surface. Some say rupture of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> deep underground might cause several smaller surface ruptures instead of a single crack in the soft soils at surface level. The search for fissures has been complicated by the remote region's thick brush and trees, mountainous terrain and difficult access. The crack on which scientists focused Friday is about five miles from the quake's epicenter. The fissure is nearly 17 feet deep at one point, runs across a two-lane mountain road, and up <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolleson </PERSON>'s gravel driveway, which they jokingly dubbed `` Allstate -LRB- insurance -RRB- Alley.'' The Wollesons were not in their secluded home at the time of the 5:04 p.m earthquake. The temblor knocked their home off its foundations and flipped their water bed mattress out of its frame. `` Most of the people up here are pretty sturdy and we'll try to rebuild, but to know so many people who have to glue their lives together is pretty impressive,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wolleson </PERSON> said. The Wollesons, who have been living in their home shrouded by redwoods for 16 years, were unaware of any fault beneath their property. `` You know it's very beautiful here,'' <PERSON> Wolleson </PERSON> said, explaining their decision to remain. `` We're just hoping the worst part is over.'' But <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, a longtime resident, said, `` My husband is absolutely ready to leave this area. I've never seen my husband shaking like he was and it was n't because of the problems yesterday. He was just so mad and he just wanted out.''

 Sir <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the actor-director who built <LOCATION> Stratford-upon-Avon </LOCATION> into a center of British theater, died Friday at his home. He was 76. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had been suffering from cancer, said his agent, <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. A versatile classical actor who created a memorable `` Falstaff'' at <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> in 1951, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had been in the theater nearly 40 years before tasting box office success with his role in `` Sleuth'' in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1970. His distinguished film credits included <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s `` The Wrong Man,'' `` The Guns of Navarone,'' `` Lawrence of Arabia'' and `` Anne of a Thousand Days,'' which brought him an Academy Award nomination for his role as Cardinal <PERSON> Wolsey </PERSON>. In 1985, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joined the distinguished company of actor-knights that has included <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> and, most recently, <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>. On Friday, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s finest actors gathered at <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abbey </LOCATION> for a memorial service in honor of <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, who died July 11 at 82. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was due to return to the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stage this fall in `` Never the Sinner,'' a courtroom drama by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> playwright <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>. He bowed out prior to rehearsals due to poor health and the West End run was indefinitely postponed. He had stepped down in July as director of Compass, a touring company he founded in 1984, and was succeeded by <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pigott-Smith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as `` very fair, very unbitchy, very uninterested in gossip and always in a good humor, amusing and understanding.'' `` He was a dear fellow,'' <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> said Friday night in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made his first appearance on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stage in 1931, and was a stalwart of the Old <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> company for several seasons. He made his American debut in 1936 in `` The Country Wife,'' which starred <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. He made his debut as a director in 1946 in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> production of `` Crime and Punishment'' starring <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. He became director of the Shakespeare Memorial Theater in <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> in 1948, appearing that first season as <PERSON> Petruchio </PERSON> in `` The Taming of the Shrew.'' He played Falstaff in both parts of `` Henry IV'' in 1951 and in `` The Merry Wives of Windsor'' in 1955. He secured the theater's reputation by luring <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> and other top names to <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>, where they were paid minimum wages. `` You have to set an example _ a merry example, I hope,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said of his time at <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>, which continued until 1956. `` In the war there was a thing called man management. It only amounted to a mixture of firmness and sympathy. If you treat people as if they are doing their best for you, then they will do their best for you,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in an interview this summer with The Independent newspaper. Yet as a manager or director, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> admitted, he sometimes believed he had been `` pouring creativity into others at the expense of my own.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said after the stage success of `` Sleuth'' that he had always had to supplement his stage income with work in television and films. `` I was in the Tarzan films, and `` Fall of the Roman Empire,' and one dreary thing after another,'' he said. Other Broadway appearances included <PERSON> Bertolt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brecht </PERSON>'s `` Galileo,'' <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON>'s `` Up the Tree'' in 1967 and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlowe </PERSON>'s `` Tamburlaine the Great'' in 1956 During World War II, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> served in the Royal Artillery and spent six months organizing partisan guerrilla forces behind German lines in <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. He is survived by his second wife, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, an American actress he married in 1947, two daughters and a son. His first marriage ended in divorce. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, one of the producers of `` Sleuth,'' which ran for 1,222 performances in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, recalled <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as `` a wonderful actor.'' `` There are some actors who have a certain personality and no matter what the role is, that personality takes over the stage,'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said. `` But <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would fit into whatever the role and characterization was rather than imposing a certain persona on the play and the audience. Sometimes with big stars that does n't happen.

 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Amotz </PERSON>, a bohemian author who was a cultural symbol for a generation of modern Israelis, died Friday of liver cancer at the age of 66. In April, <PERSON> Ben-Amotz </PERSON> threw a gala party at a nightclub after doctors diagnosed his cancer as incurable. He read a farewell letter to 300 friends and socialites who gathered to give their final regards. To many Israelis, the husky, bearded <PERSON> Ben-Amotz </PERSON> was a cultural icon who set the style for sabras, as native-born Israelis are called. The term comes from the prickly cactus fruit that is tough on the outside and sweet on the inside. `` He helped create the sabra personality,'' said <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafetz </PERSON>, an author. `` He was brash, direct, unpretentious, idealistic in some ways, and naive in other ways.'' But <PERSON> Ben-Amotz </PERSON>, a Jewish refugee who was born <PERSON> Moishe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tehilimzunger </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and lost his parents in the Holocaust, also symbolized modern Israeli Jews trying to reject their tragic European past. <PERSON> Ben-Amotz </PERSON> published `` To Remember and To Forget,'' his first full-scale novel, in 1968. In the book he tried to confront such questions as his European past and German guilt over the Holocaust. As did many immigrants who came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> between the 1930s and 1950s, doubling the state's Jewish population, <PERSON> Ben-Amotz </PERSON> adopted a new name. He made his impact on Israeli society through his radio talk show in the 1950s called `` Three Men in a Boat.'' The popular show was one of the first Israeli broadcasts to reject the formal Hebrew of the state's founders and use the common language of the streets. <PERSON> Ben-Amotz </PERSON> was widely considered one of the pioneers in the revival of modern Hebrew from a dormant language of prayer and study. He authored a dictionary of Hebrew slang, wrote articles and novels that shocked many Israelis with their frankness _ even their titles contained obscenities. He also was instrumental in developing modern Israeli theater. <PERSON> Ben-Amotz </PERSON> immigrated in 1933 and studied agriculture on a collective farm before joining the Palyam, a naval detatchment of the Jewish underground Palmach militia. He was active after World War II in smuggling Jewish refugees and weapons to the infant state. In his later years he worked as a columnist for Israeli newspapers and was a fixture on the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> social scene. <PERSON> Ben-Amotz </PERSON> is survived by four children; three live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and one lives in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The army command forced the retirement Friday of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rico </PERSON>, who led two insurrections that endangered the government of former President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. Gen. <PERSON> Isidro </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, appointed army commander earlier this year, issued the order affecting <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> and four other leaders of a January 1988 revolt, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> reported. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> must approve the action, but he said Thursday: `` It does n't matter to me what names are included. I'll sign it. Rico, 44, led soldiers who took over part of the <LOCATION> Campo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION> army base on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> in April 1987, and another rebellion nine months later at the <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caseros </ORGANIZATION> base in northeastern <LOCATION> Corrientes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>. He demanded an end to trials in civilian courts of officers accused of violating human rights during the `` dirty war'' conducted against leftists while the military ruled <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 1976-83. Rico, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Naya </PERSON> and the other three were cashiered after the revolts, but their ranks were restored later so military courts could try them. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> pardoned them Oct. 7 in a group of 39 colonels, generals and vice admirals accused of kidnapping, torture and murder under military rule. He also pardoned 64 alleged leftist guerrillas, 174 officers accused in the rebellions and three _ including former President Gen. <PERSON> Leopoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> _ convicted of misconduct in the disastrous <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> war with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1982. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> intended the sweeping amnesty to cool passions that led to the rebellions, street demonstrations, bitter debates in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and scattered violence. <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> of the Mothers of the <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION>, relatives whose children disappeared during the `` dirty war,'' said 1 million people had signed anti-amnesty petitions that would be presented to <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>. Rico has wide support among junior officers in the 85,000-man military, who feel the campaign against leftists was a kind of civil war and deserves gratitude, not censure. An investigation conducted by <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s government found that about 9,000 people disappeared and were presumed dead. Rights groups say 30,000 is more accurate.

<HEAD>Long Process To Sue The State, Which Has Design Defect Immunity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If victims of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area earthquake decide to sue the state for injuries, losses or relatives' deaths caused by the collapse of state-built structures, they face a long and complex process. State law gives the state design defect immunity. That means the state can not be sued because of a basic defect in the design of a public works project, such as a highway. `` That will be an issue'' in any lawsuits filed relating to the collapses of sections of Interstate 880 freeway or the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON>, spokesman fir the state attorney general. Victims who believe the state was to blame for their losses ca n't go into court as quickly as if they were suing a private person or business. `` Before you can sue the state, you have to file a claim,'' said <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonderland </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Nobody has yet filed a claim with the state relating to the earthquake. The Board of Control staff looks at the claim, solicits a response from the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> allegedly at fault, and makes a recommendation to the board. The board has three members, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the controller and a governor's appointee. The board then decides whether to pay the claim. The payment must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Sonderland </PERSON> said that the board routinely rejects a claim, such as one that might arise from the bridge or I-880 collapse, if it is `` a complex issue of fact and-or law.'' `` This enables the individual to sue the state and go directly to court,'' he said. He said it normally takes the board 45 to 60 days to process a claim. He said the board was never intended to determine complex legal liability questions and its members are not judges. Civil lawsuit settlements or judgments would also have to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, which has rejected both claims and lawsuit judgments in the past. The plaintiff has little recourse if the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> rejects the payment, said <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON>. The largest judgment the state has had to pay was about $ 4 million for damages in the 1965 <LOCATION> Crescent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> floods, he said. Lawsuits relating to the 1986 floods are still pending, he said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> inspected the ravages of the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake Friday, breathing a single word _ `` Jesus'' _ when he got his first look at the collapsed freeway still covering uncounted bodies. He promised all-out federal help with `` no red tape.'' `` It's been a very moving day,'' the president said at the end of a four-hour tour of the region that gave him first-hand look at some of the areas that were hardest hit by the quake. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` willing to do what's needed to be done,'' as he faced repeated questions from local officials about how much recovery money the government would provide _ and when. He offered no details on the size of the federal contribution to relief efforts. Commenting `` there's no ceiling on the compassion of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined on several occasions to rule out the possibility of of tax increases to pay for recovery costs. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, one of three mayors accompanying the president on his tour, told him: `` We need fast action. We need checks written on the spot.'' `` We will do what is necessary to fulfill our responsibility,'' said the president, flanked by state and federal officials. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that government officials on all levels needed to cooperate, that `` we've got to work with each other.'' `` In terms of what it will cost, I do n't know,'' he said. But he added that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will work with local and state governments `` to see the suffering is alleviated, the restoration begins.'' Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, newly designated to head federal quake-recovery efforts, promised the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was prepared to play `` a very very major role in helping <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' Accompanied by state officials as well as the mayors of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew over some of the hardest-hit areas by helicopter and visited the collapsed double-decker expressway in <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> in which an unknown number of rush-hour motorists are feared still entombed. He also visited <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and inspected damage in the coastal city of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, near the epicenter of Tuesday's powerful earthquake The president said `` the most touching moment'' of his visit was when he talked to the doctor who rescued young <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON> from a crushed car. The doctor had to amputate the boy's leg to get him free. `` I had the opportunity to talk to the dad who was at the bedside of this 6-year-old boy and I had a chance to tell him that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people were rooting for him, to tell his dad that we all care,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In his first stop, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> walked tieless and wearing a flight jacket with the presidential seal slowly alongside the collapsed freeway where workers with heavy machinery are trying to extricate the bodies from cars crushed between the two decks. The ground was covered with rubble, including massive chunks of concrete and giant fallen pillars. Twisted steel girders protruded from the structure. Smashed cars were visible between the upper and lower decks. `` I am deeply moved by this, saddened in some ways, yet very stimulated by this team effort,'' the president said. He complimented rescue teams and added that he admired `` the way this community is pulling together. ... We'll see what we can do to be part of the answer.'' He questioned the propriety of his own visit, saying, `` I had a doubt, is it proper for me to come here? If you do, they say you're getting in the way of the lifting or the building or the fire-fighting or whatever. But he added, `` If you do n't go _ why it's neglect.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also taped a public service television announcement offering encouragement to <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area residents and urging Americans around the nation to contribute to volunteer organizations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who won office on a firm pledge of no new taxes, said, `` I'm going to do what is necessary to have the federal government fulfill its obligation,'' and repeated substantially the same phrase when asked if that meant new taxes. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> has said he is willing to face a state tax increase, if necessary, and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would vote relief funds regardless of what it did to the federal deficit In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats are working on a $ 2.5 billion relief package. But <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, talking with reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One on the flight west, said, `` I do n't know where they got'' that figure, and local officials had raised damage estimates to $ 5.5 billion on Friday. Administration officials, speaking only on the condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> request to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would likely far surpass the $ 1.1 billion voted to help Hurricane Hugo victims. In a meeting with local officials at <ORGANIZATION> Moffett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised the relief effort would not become bogged down in red tape. `` You ca n't have every ` t' crossed and every ` i' dotted,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Agnos </LOCATION>, a Democrat who had criticized Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for not visiting him on his trip Wednesday, told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that his city was `` 90 percent back to normal.'' Still, he said, referring to the obvious damage, `` when you walk this ground, you feel it in your gut.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwaitkowski </PERSON>, assistant associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> would likely need close to $ 1 billion alone for its relief efforts here _ and that does n't include major construction repairs. <PERSON> Kwaitkowski </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> plans to open 10 disaster centers in the area on Sunday _ and eventually planned to have a total of 20 open, including three mobile units. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> called the federal response so far `` tremendous'' but said the state's $ 1 billion reserve fund would be soon depleted. `` We're probably looking at $ 3 billion or so'' in total damage, he told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, D-Calif., told reporters here that the total damage costs will run between $ 8 billion and $ 10 billion _ of which he said the federal government should pay between $ 5 billion and $ 6 billion He said he did not foresee a clash between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over the amount of the aid package. `` The fact that the president responded so quickly means that any kind of partisanship is out of the question.''

 Millions of dollars and offers of everything from clothing to chiropractors flowed into <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Friday as thousands of refugees from quake-buckled homes waited anxiously in makeshift shelters. Relief officials worried that the aid, though widespread, was n't enough to fill the needs of what by some estimates could be the most expensive natural disaster in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history `` What we need is cash,'' said <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, spokesperson for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> chapter in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which was routing donations of food, clothing, blankets and other goods to the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and other aid groups. Red Cross officials said most donations were welcome but some were ill-considered in the immediate wake of the disaster. One company, for example, volunteered caseloads of rarely used D-size batteries. In <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiropractic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> offered its services. `` At least in the first seven days we have to be handling people's absolute basic life needs: food, clothing and shelter,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, public information director for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` We need toilet paper, plastic spoons and paper plates and those kinds of things,'' she said. Computers and fax machines were also being sought to enable the agency to compile lists of the dead, injured and homeless, Ms. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said. `` Every country in the world is calling for information,'' she said. But the most urgent requirement was for money to help relocate homeless families from shelters to temporary living quarters such as hotels, Ms. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. As of Friday morning, 5,000 people were housed in 30 shelters in the region affected by Tuesday's quake, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said. Overall, an estimated 12,550 people were displaced, according to the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Offers of money came from several multinational corporations, some with long-term ties to the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, as well as smaller pockets. In <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, two radio stations raised $ 40,120 in an all-day pledge-a-thon. A <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>, hairstylist announced she would hold a cut-a-thon Sunday and donate the $ 5-a-head proceeds. Perhaps the biggest private donation came Friday from the Los Angeles-based <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> foundation, funded by the estate of the late engineer, which gave $ 1 million _ $ 750,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and $ 250,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. As of Friday, about $ 7 million had been pledged to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> alone, Ms. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, offered $ 1 million in aid. `` We share the shock and grief of those who have suffered as a a result of the earthquake,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dussen </PERSON>, president of the Park Ridge, N.J.-based subsidiary. Another Japanese giant, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, said it would give $ 300,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and $ 100,000 each to the police and fire departments of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>. San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 1 million grant program to help communities rebuild. The bank also planned to give a $ 250,000 grant to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it was donating $ 300,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and $ 200,000 to the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 500,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> announced it had donated food and other products valued at more than $ 300,000. Many people, however, simply loaned a hand. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has been deluged with 5,000 volunteers, Ms. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said. Indeed, for a time there were more volunteers than homeless. `` The ironic thing is that yesterday we had more people coming in to volunteer than we had a need for'' she said, adding that officials were concerned that `` as soon as the thrill is gone, the volunteers will disappear.'' `` For a month, we'll have a huge need for volunteers,'' she said. The Soviet government, offering a return favor for the millions of dollars and thousands of foreign rescuers and doctors that poured into <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> after December's earthquake, volunteered to send doctors, geologists and rescue workers to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. Red Cross officials, noting that Thursday was the one-month anniversary of Hurricane Hugo's assault on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, said the quake would be a crushing burden to what what was already the highest-ever relief bill in the organization's 108-year history. `` In 1906, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 9 million on earthquake relief in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. There's 50 times more population now and a wider area affected. Just with inflation alone you can begin to conjure up astronomical figures,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>. With damage estimates already at more than $ 5.5 billion, the earthquake was the most expensive natural disaster in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history with the possible exception of the 1906 quake, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The 1906 devastation cost up to $ 5.8 billion in current dollars, said <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the group. A private economist, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said damage from Tuesday's quake is likely to reach $ 10 billion.

<TEXT>
 Riot troops fired on striking government workers on Friday, wounding 10 people, including a local television reporter, police said. The shooting broke out after someone in the crowd of strikers threw a stick of dynamite that exploded near a line of policemen. Police said the dynamite was thrown by a leftist rebel who had infiltrated the march in downtown <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, seven blocks from Government Palace. A police spokesman initially said it was unknown who fired the shots that wounded the 10. He said police had been ordered not to shoot at strikers. But police investigators who inspected the site later said they found shell casings that matched the type of arms used by riot police. Government workers are demanding higher pay, and Friday's protest was a rejection of a 50 percent wage increase announced by the government Wednesday Strikers said the increase would amount to less than 10 percent when measured against rising inflation. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Guimarey </PERSON>, a reporter covering the strike for Channel 9 Television, was shot in the arm and slightly wounded by the gunfire. A spokesman for the <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> station said <PERSON> Guimarey </PERSON> told colleagues he did not see who shot him.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the world's leading buyer of ivory, is studying whether it will join a ban on ivory trade approved this week at a conference of 91 nations, a government spokesman said Friday. The head of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> urged <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members at a meeting to support the ban to avoid `` international isolation'' on the issue. The government <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is still studying the issue, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> later told reporters. `` We have not yet reached a conclusion, but we are aware of the consensus in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Lausanne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species voted Monday to put the elephant on the endangered species list, thereby banning ivory trade. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a convention member, abstained from the vote.

 The heroic rescue of 6-year-old <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON>, who could be saved from a mangled car only by amputating his leg and sawing in half the body of his dead mother, has sent waves of sympathy rippling across the nation. The hospital where the boy and his sister are recovering is tallying toys and phone calls, and a fund has been set up for <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>. `` The story just brought us back to reality about how important life is,'' said <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Palkowitz </PERSON>, who brought stuffed animals for <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> and his 8-year-old sister, <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON>, who was also pulled from the family's crushed car. `` You never know if that was going to be one of your family,'' Ms. <PERSON> Palkowitz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> was reported to be conscious Friday. <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> was in fair condition with head injuries. The boy was one of the last survivors pulled from the debris of two-tiered Interstate 880 after it buckled and tumbled during Tuesday's earthquake. The story of the four-hour, flood-lit rescue, including a doctor's skill and courage, brought calls from throughout the country to a bank, where a trust fund has been established. `` The phone has been ringing off the hook,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Summit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>. Rescuers who reached <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON>'s car Tuesday were able to remove <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> was pinned in by his mother's seat. Doctors decided they had to saw through the seat and Mrs. <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON>'s body to get to <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>, and then found that <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>'s right leg was pinned under a highway pillar that had fallen on the car. Dr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>, lying on a board pushed into a narrow opening carved in the debris, performed the operation in about 10 minutes. The doctors used local anesthetic and pumped morphine and Valium intravenously into the boy's system. After more than four hours, <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> was finally freed from the mangled car and taken to the hospital. He had surgery Wednesday, but surgeons did not have to amputate his other leg. `` This was your worst nightmare,'' <PERSON> Betts </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I'd do it again. I know if I was up there or one of my family members was up there, I'd want them to do it.'' Children's <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>'s father, Pastor <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON>, and several friends and relatives waited, was deluged with similar calls of support and sympathy. Hospital officials said <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, was aware of the attention his son had attracted, but wanted to stay out of the public spotlight. `` He's very much in touch with this, but in his grief, he has asked everyone to leave,'' said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met <PERSON> Betts </PERSON> on his tour of the earthquake-ravaged area and talked with <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON> by telephone at his son's bedside. `` The most touching moment was ... when this doctor, this marvelously heroic doctor and his associate told me of pulling a kid out and having to amputate his leg to get him out of this crushed car,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON> had been at the hospital almost constantly since the accident and was being supported by relatives, friends and hospital counselors. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>'s classmates at the year-round <ORGANIZATION> Downer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pablo </LOCATION> are on a vacation break, but officials said they were already making plans to help the family. <PERSON> Noraleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowell </PERSON>, a school secretary, said <PERSON> Downer </PERSON>'s parent club was going to hold a benefit raffle on Nov. 15, with proceeds going to a fund for the family.

 When federal judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' eight-year legal battle over a bribery charge ended Friday with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote to remove him from the bench, he immediately announced he would run for governor. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> _ outspoken, witty and a dynamic speaker _ almost never evokes a neutral reaction from those around him, and the latest events were no exception. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' ouster 10 years after President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> made him <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s first black <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District judge sparked an angry reaction from blacks, and his political announcement surprised <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> politicians. The ouster `` sends a shocking and chilling message to black folks all over the country that we have not overcome yet,'' said <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> physician and longtime <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> supporter. `` It's a definite travesty to our justice system,'' said <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` We have to wonder who is next? Who will be singled out?'' `` We must question whether justice was truly served by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action,'' <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Hooks said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s action, `` in my view, constitutes double jeopardy and this flies in the face of the foundation that buttress our legal system.'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, 53, was removed for allegedly conspiring to take a $ 150,000 payoff to fix a court case. A federal jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> acquitted him in 1983. But a subsequent investigation led to his impeachment last year in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which accused him of plotting to obtain a bribe, lying during his trial and an unrelated charge of improperly disclosing federal wiretap information. Sen. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., voted for impeachment last year while still a representative, but did not vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s other senator, Democrat <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, voted in <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' favor, saying there was no clear and convincing evidence of his guilt <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> had said he would have announcement that could blunt angry reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote, but his gubernatorial bid was unexpected. `` This ranks up there as one of the most bizarre'' political events in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, a spokesman for Republican Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who is up for re-election next year. `` Based on that track record, he's going to run for governor?'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> asked. `` Anybody who wants to is welcome to run for governor. They'll have to take on an incumbent who is going to get re-elected.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who was on a glass-bottom boat off Key Largo with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, laughed when told of <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' announcement `` You'll have to ask <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> about that,'' he said, referring to the Democrats in the race. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> had not heard of the announcement Friday morning when asked to comment on <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' plan to run for governor. `` Of what?'' <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> asked. `` I would certainly like to sit down with him to assess his opportunities and his chances and how they might affect the race,'' <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said. `` That's about as much as I can tell you at this point.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> faces a challenge from within his own party from state Sen. <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodson-Howard </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> are running as Democrats. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' ouster did not seem like an opportune time to announce for governor. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> was out of town and could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said he believes <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> has `` a small following'' and will get some votes, `` but I do not think he will be a serious contender.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s action saddened those who had worked with the judge, whose outspoken style has won over many people and alienated others. `` I am personally very sorry,'' said Acting Chief Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON>. `` We will miss him.''

<TEXT>
 Two dissident members partly lifted the veil of secrecy on the Swedish Academy Friday and said they had lobbied for years to give the Nobel Prize for literature to Spanish writer <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kerstin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyllensten </PERSON> boycotted the vote of the 18-member Academy because of a dispute over its refusal to condemn death threats against British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his book `` The Satanic Verses.'' The Academy's deliberations are protected by Swedish secrecy laws for 50 years and members are bound by an even stricter code of silence forbidding comments on decisons. <PERSON> Ekman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gyllensten </PERSON> and a third dissident member, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspenstrom </PERSON>, handed in letters of resignation, but the academy rejected the move because members are elected for life. There was no immediate comment from the Academy on the comments by <PERSON> Ekman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gyllensten </PERSON>, who said they welcomed the choice of <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>, 73, announced Thursday. `` He has been one of my main candidates for some years back. He is a very original writer with a very broad range,'' <PERSON> Gyllensten </PERSON> said on Swedish Radio. `` I think he will be regarded as one of the finer choices of Nobel laureates the Academy has made.'' `` I have been one of those working for this prize and I'm very glad that it came about,'' <PERSON> Ekman </PERSON> told the radio. <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagercrantz </PERSON>, author and a former editor-in-chief of the influential <ORGANIZATION> Dagens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nyheter </ORGANIZATION> daily, said the Nobel Prize is `` a lottery unworthy of the world of the spirit'' and should be discontinued. Asked his view of <PERSON> Cela </PERSON>, he said, `` I have no view at all. I have not read a single line by him. It is so silly this prize that you can not have a view on it.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it will add three high-speed express Metroliner trains between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to compete with the airlines. Some members of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> congressional delegation immediately protested to <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> their state was being neglected because none of the new trains will stop there. Starting Oct. 30, the new trains, one northbound and two southbound, will make the 225-mile run in 2 hours, 35 minutes to 2 hours, 40 minutes. One will run non-stop and the other two will make only one stop, at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburbs. The only existing express Metroliner stops only at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION> on its 2-hour, 40-minute northbound trip. The expresses will give out free newspapers like the shuttle. Northbound expresses will sell <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> subway tokens; southbound expresses will sell <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> subway fare cards. With a fare of $ 74 one-way vs. the shuttle's $ 99 at rush hour, <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> is hoping to attract more passengers. The new expresses are 15 to 20 minutes faster than regular Metroliners, 55 minutes faster than regular trains, and are close to the time needed by air when airport-to-city center segments are included. `` We feel we need to remain competitive with the airlines,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. `` We feel it will improve our revenues,'' and the current number of Metroliner stops in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is not being reduced. Still, Rep. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> on the transportation subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` They're trying to compete with <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> by blazing through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. But the few minutes it takes to pick up passengers in <LOCATION> Metropark </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> would hardly matter.'' He said adding a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> stop would add less than 10 minutes to the journey time. `` This decision by your office is a short-sighted effort that disserves the <LOCATION> Newark-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area,'' <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON> said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> that was signed by five other members of the state's 14-member House delegation.

<TEXT>
 An artillery accident that killed three soldiers has been blamed on the use of too much powder, and two solidiers have been charged with negligent homicide and dereliction of duty, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The howitzer round strayed off target, and exploded behind a group of about 80 soldiers, who were standing in formation to leave a rifle range Sept. 27. Four of the 24 injured soldiers remained hospitalized Friday. Sgt. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and Spec. <PERSON> Nickoles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, were charged in military court, said <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sill </LOCATION> spokeswoman Sheil Samples. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, a howitzer battery section chief, and <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>, a No. 2 cannoneer, are accused of using too much powder, which the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said caused the 105mm howitzer round to land outside the designated impact area. Ms. Samples said the amount of powder was not being released. The stray round created a 2-foot wide, 1-foot deep crater behind the soldiers, who were in the seventh week of an eight-week training program at the sprawling Field Artillery Center in southwest <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> were not in confinement Friday and were performing their duties, but they were not firing cannons, Ms. Samples said. The charges were read to the men by their battery commander Wednesday. The case will be referred to Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallada </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sill </LOCATION> commander, who will determine the disposition of charges. If a general court-martial is convened, the maximum sentence the men could receive if convicted of dereliction of duty through negligence would be three months confinement and loss of three-fourths of their pay and allowances for three months, Ms. Samples said. If convicted of negligent homicide, the maximum sentence would be a bad-conduct discharge, one year of confinement and total loss of pay and allowance for that year, she said. If convicted of both charges, the maximum sentence would be a bad conduct discharge, 15 months confinement and total loss of pay and allowances, she said.

 An early morning quake shook the hill country south of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, creating panic and minor structural damage to buildings but authorities said no injuries were reported. Local police and fire departments said hundreds of residents of the <LOCATION> Alban </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> called in to say they were frightened by the temblor, which lasted about 10 seconds. `` The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> effect and the fact it happened during the night caused the worry,'' the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> quoted an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as saying, referring to the quake that struck the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area this week. The temblor, which shook an area about 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, registered 6 to 7 on the 12-point Mercalli scale. An earthquake of that magnitude can cause serious damage. The Mercalli and <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scales are not convertible. Firemen said the walls of hospitals in <LOCATION> Rocca </LOCATION> di Papa and <PERSON> Albano </PERSON> sustained minor cracks but no major structural damage.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the `` most touching moment'' during his Friday tour of quake devastation was talking to the father of a 6-year-old boy pulled from a crushed car and to the doctors who had to amputate his leg to free him. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after a visit to collapsed Interstate Highway 880 here, talked with Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>, the surgeon who performed the operation, and by phone with the boy's father, <PERSON> Pastor </PERSON> <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON>, who was at his son's bedside. `` So this human dimension is brought home much more clearly by coming here,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in remarks at nearby <LOCATION> Moffett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in Mountain View. `` The most touching moment was ... when this doctor, this marvelously heroic doctor and his associate told me of pulling a kid out and having to amputate his leg to get him out of this crushed car,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he then talked to the father at the boy's bedside `` and I had a chance to tell him that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people were rooting for him, to tell his dad that we all care.'' <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Berumen </PERSON> and his 8-year-old sister, <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON>, were trapped in a car that had been crushed when the two-tier elevated expressway collpased when the earthquake struck. The children's mother and a friend had been killed instantly by the crash. Although <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> was freed within an hour, rescuers had to cut the mother's body in half to get to <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>. Doctors then had to amputate the boy's right leg below the knee to free him from pieces of concrete. <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>, a trauma surgeon from <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, performed the surgery at the scene on the night of the quake, working in a tight crawl space between the layers of the pancaked highway. After a walking tour of a section of the collapsed expressway, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went into a trailor to meet <PERSON> Betts </PERSON> and a medical associate and to call the boy's father. `` How are things going?'' he said to the boy's father. `` I'm proud of your courage, proud of the doctors You be strong. Have your faith.'' The boy is in critical condition at a local hospital; his sister is in fair condition. `` There 1,000 of these kinds of incidents, I'm sure, that I'm not even aware of,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said later

 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> on Friday bailed out of a group trying to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a defection that sent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock into another tailspin and dealt the buyout plan its second stunning blow in a week. The pilots union at <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which along with management is leading the buyout attempt, quickly announced it was developing a new plan that would include for the first time <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants as partners. But some analysts and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which has opposed the buyout plan, said British Airway's departure may doom the proposal. In a brief statement Friday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> in the foreseeable future.'' It did n't give reasons, but said its marketing agreement with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> would remain in effect. `` We're obviously disappointed. However, we do plan to move ahead with our new partners, the flight attendants, who joined with us yesterday,'' said <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> represents 7,000 of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 70,000 workers. The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 14,000 workers at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement saying it would participate with <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management in discussions about any new proposal. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, a spokesman for Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, said the company had no comment on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' withdrawal. The original pilot-management buyout proposal approved by <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors called for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> workers to own 75 percent of the company, management 10 percent and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> 15 percent It would have been the largest employee-led buyout of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' announcement came one week after the pilot-management group said it had failed to secure financing for its original $ 6.75 billion, $ 300-a-share offer, contributing to a Friday the 13th selloff on Wall Street that resurrected fears of the 1987 stock market crash. While the stock market overall has rebounded since last week, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> shares have continued spiraling lower, reflecting growing pessimism among investors that any debt-financed takeover proposal of the airline will succeed. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> tumbled $ 21.62 -LCB- to finish at $ 168.50 a share Friday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, bringing its decline for the week to about $ 110. Airline analysts in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> were pessimistic about the remaining partners' chances for success. `` For the time being, I think it's dead, to be honest,'' said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, of the investment firm <PERSON> Laing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cruickshank </PERSON>. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> agreed. `` It was not a viable proposal that would have done the employees any good,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters of the union, which represents 25,000 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> workers. `` We're hoping that'll be the end of it,'' said <PERSON> Conley </PERSON>, whose union has maintained the pilot-management proposal would saddle <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> with a dangerous debt load. But airline analyst <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> may not necessarily have pulled out for good. He said <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, which prides itself on being a first-class carrier, is unaccustomed to the indignity of whipsawing takeover efforts. But `` they have invested very, very heavily in their relationship with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> said.

 A protest by conscientious objectors outside the federal <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building Friday led to a brief fight between protesters and bodyguards for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Momper </PERSON>. The anti-military service group called `` Action for Total Refusal'' was protesting federal efforts to force a convicted draft dodger to serve jail time in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Federal officials are trying to extradite <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to begin serving a five-month sentence for refusing both mandatory military service and the alternative <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> option for those opposed to violence. About 10 demonstrators, protesting illegally on the Parliament grounds, startled <PERSON> Momper </PERSON>'s security detachment when they unfurled a banner that had been hidden in a bouquet of flowers the protesters tried to press on <PERSON> Momper </PERSON>. One of the protesters wore a rubber mask of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on the back of his head and had his coat on backwards as well, creating the impression he had his back to <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> when he leaped forward to unfurl the banner. Security men quickled wrestled the masked protester to the ground, and others engaged in brief battles with demonstrators to separate them from Momper's party. <PERSON> Momper </PERSON>, a member of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, had been asked by the anti-military service group to reject the extradition request. He was at the federal <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building on Friday to be inaugurated as president of the Bundesrat, the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Demonstrations are forbidden on the West German Parliament grounds, but no arrests were made following the incident Friday. West German residents of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> are not subject to the compulsory service law because of the city's status under Allied control. But <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> was a resident of <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION> state when he reached the military service age. He is in hiding in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, where authorities have been asked to find him and return him to <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION> to serve his term.

<TEXT>
 A car bomb exploded Friday in front of a hotel in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION>, seriously injuring six people, the city's fire chief said. <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION> is well known in drug-trafficking circles as the jumping-off point for much of the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> cocaine that is smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The army headquarters in <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION> said in a communique broadcast by the radio network <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> that five hotel employees and a guest were injured in the blast. A suspect reportedly was arrested, <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting police sources. In other developments, two more mid-level drug trafficking suspects were arrested and being held for extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s federal police said, and judges demanding more protection from traffickers ended a strike. The national radio network <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported that authorities took about 2,000 <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> emerald dealers in for questioning following last week's slayings of seven dealers in <LOCATION> Quipama </LOCATION>, a town 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Authorities arrested several detained dealers and confiscated some small arms, <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the detentions were intended to prevent more violence among dealers vying for control of emerald mines in <LOCATION> Boyaca </LOCATION> state. A <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> police spokeswoman said she could not confirm the detentions. In the last two months, 22 people have died as a result of battles for control of the mines. The drug suspects were identified by Colombian national police as <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. Both were arrested Thursday, <PERSON> Sokolowski </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cerrejon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Sokolowski </PERSON> was actually <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokol </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 29, who is wanted on a 1984 federal indictment in <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, on conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Colombian police said <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, 55, is wanted by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> federal court on charges of possession of cocaine and conspiracy to distribute the drug. Four drug traffickers already have been extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face trial. The latest arrest brings to six the number of Colombians awaiting extradition on drug-related charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. None of the leaders of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine cartels however have been arrested since President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> announced his crackdown Aug. 18 on traffickers following the assassination of a leading presidential candidate. Although judges ended a three-day strike for protection from drug barons, they said their demands were not met and they have not received any of the $ 19 million in security aid promised by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The judges threatened to strike again if the government does not provide bulletproof vests, bulletproof cars and bodyguards. The government has promised for next week 25 motorcycles for guards, 72 bulletproof vests and 14 metal detectors, a lawyer with the union told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. On Nov. 30, 50 bulletproof cars will be turned over to judges who face the most danger from the traffickers, said the lawyer, <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Oviedo </PERSON>. All of the promised equipment is Colombian, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Oviedo </ORGANIZATION> said, however, the equipment will cover just 2 percent of the judges who have received death threats from drug traffickers. The only protection given the country's 5,000 judges so far were 40 bulletproof vests delivered as part of a $ 65 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid package for fighting traffickers, <ORGANIZATION> Oviedo </ORGANIZATION> said. But the vests weighed 45 pounds and were returned because they were so heavy and many of the lighter-framed judges were barely able to walk around with them on, the lawyer said. The bomb in <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION>, placed in a <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> sedan, broke almost all the windows in the front of the 16-story Royal Hotel, fire chief <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> radio network. Several cars also were damaged, he said. A bomb Sept. 25 in the Hilton Hotel in another <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> city, <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>, killed two people. As in the <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> bombing, no one claimed responsibility for the <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION> explosion. Since the crackdown began, 165 bomb blasts have killed 16 people and injured 201. The federal and municipal judges and 12,000 other court workers went on strike Tuesday, hours after a federal judge was murdered in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. Drug traffickers claimed responsibility and said the judge was killed in retaliation for the extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of drug trafficking suspects. In the last 12 years, 221 Colombian court workers, including 42 judges, have been killed, many by traffickers. The daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that a lawyer representing the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel contacted the country's leading leftist presidential candidate two weeks ago. The candidate, <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaramillo </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, and the lawyer met at <PERSON> Jaramillo </PERSON>'s house, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said. The lawyer, who was not identified, made a plea for contacts between <PERSON> Jaramillo </PERSON>'s party and the traffickers, the daily quoted <PERSON> Jaramillo </PERSON> as saying. Former President <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelsen </PERSON> said Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should give $ 500 million a year to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to fight drug traffickers, noting <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> spends millions `` to stop the advance of communism'' in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Mine Officials Believe Torch Sparked Explosion, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEATCROFT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Top officials of a coal mine where 10 men died in an explosion last month believe an acetylene torch sparked the blast, a newspaper reported Friday. Federal and state investigators have not determined what ignited methane gas that exploded Sept. 13 in the western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> mine, but The <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION> -LRB- Ind. -RRB- Press said a cutting torch is <ORGANIZATION> Pyro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s official theory. Investigators recovered two cutting torches from the mine soon after the explosion. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Childers </PERSON>, chief investigator for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said Oct. 3 that the valves on the torches were closed, but did not rule them out as a possible source of ignition. The Press said Pyro officials have told about 25 workers about the company's theory. The newspaper said two of those workers talked to the Press on condition of anonymity. `` They're leaning toward the torches,'' the newspaper quoted one of the Pyro employees as saying. `` They believe there might have been a small pocket of -LRB- methane -RRB- gas -LRB- to -RRB- ignite, and it carried into a bigger pocket of gas that exploded.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulties </PERSON>, president of Pyro parent <ORGANIZATION> Costain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Costain </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenlee </PERSON> said Wednesday they have reached a conclusion about what caused the explosion but would not discuss it publicly until all mine employees were notified. <PERSON> Greenlee </PERSON> would neither confirm nor deny the cutting-torch theory, The Press said. Costain officials did not return telephone calls Friday from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Officials of the federal mine safety agency have theorized that shortly before the explosion, company workers removed a cinderblock partition which helps direct air within the mine. That could have pushed a pocket of methane gas into the area where the victims were working, causing in an explosion, the agency has said. <ORGANIZATION> Costain </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they believe the barrier was removed after the explosion and that it could not have been a factor even if it had been removed before the accident. The <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> mine has been closed since the blast, but <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> will allow it to reopen as soon as three ventilation problems are corrected, a spokesman said Friday. The problems are among some 280 citations the government has issued since the explosion. All but 14 of the citations have been taken care of, and none appears related to the cause of the accident, <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>.

 The space shuttle's astronauts were told to conserve power Friday for a possible one - or two-day extension of their mission due to the threat of high winds at Atlantis' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> landing site Monday Mission Control directed shuttle commander <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to shut down a high-power heater on a cooling system. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> suggested also turning off one of three computer displays on the flight deck. Mission control commentator <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> was trying to trim about 600 watts of power usage to enable the shuttle to stay in orbit longer. Without conservation, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> has enough fuel, oxygen, power and other supplies to remain aloft two days beyond the planned five-day mission, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. Atlantis is scheduled to land at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> at 3:38 p.m. EDT. The possibility of a longer mission arose when a weather front moved across the shuttle landing site. High winds following the front could be a problem for <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> on Monday, forecasters said. Flight Director <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittemore </PERSON> told reporters that forecasters hope the winds will be calm by Monday, or at least calm enough to permit landing one orbit early _ about 90 minutes before originally scheduled _ when afternoon gusts would be less severe. If a Monday landing is impossible at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dittemore </PERSON> said, Atlantis would be kept in orbit at least an extra day. Should the winds persist for a couple days, controllers would consider an alternate landing site, he said. The <PERSON> Northrup </PERSON> <PERSON> Strip </PERSON> at White Sands Missile Range, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, would be the first choice and the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> would be second. The astronauts spent part of the third day of their experiment-filled space flight demonstrating simple medical procedures that can be done aboard the shuttle. In the medical demonstration, astronaut <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON>, playing `` patient,'' floated upside down while <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a physician, took her temperature and examined her throat and ears. The session was taped earlier in the day by the astronauts and later aired on <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> satellite television. The shuttle's first-aid kit `` carries pretty much what any doctor's black bag would carry,'' Ms. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. It includes a stethoscope, bandages, adhesive, aspirin and other common medications. The astronauts also photographed the beauties and blemishes of Earth for a documentary film. `` We just got some great shots of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, right over the border between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>; the city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> was completely clear,'' said astronaut <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, and who has been a hero in that country since his first space shuttle mission in 1986. He plans on Saturday to speak from orbit with Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. But the 70mm motion pictures are n't for home movies. The crews of several shuttle flights have been snapping thousands of feet of film of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s features for a documentary called `` Exploring the Blue Planet.'' The large-screen film, which will debut next September at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, not only will show the grandeur of the planet but also will exhibit how it is being environmentally damaged by both man and nature. The <ORGANIZATION> IMAX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is producing the film, said it wants to show how such things as pollution dumps into waterways, deforestation of rain forests, storms and other phenomena have an impact on the globe. The astronauts were instructed by the ground Friday to photograph a dust storm over the African nation of <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and volcanoes in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. `` We also got some good shots of the Straits of <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> said. Other targets Friday included <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the islands of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area, northwest <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The astronauts also beamed to <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> brilliant television pictures of the aurora australis, or southern lights, a luminous show created by solar radiation interacting with the Earth's magnetic field near the South Pole. `` Spectacular,'' commented <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON>. The fifth crew member is pilot <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON>. As the astronauts worked through a heavy schedule of medical and science experiments, the nuclear-powered <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe they deployed about six hours after blastoff Wednesday was hurtling across the solar system at 9,000 mph relative to the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and was in `` perfect shape,'' officials reported. The $ 1.5 billion probe's course for its six-year, 2.4 billion-mile trip to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION> had covered nearly 500,000 miles Friday. Once it reaches Jupiter, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> is to orbit the planet and give the best look yet of another planet and find clues to the universe's origin. `` The flight team is quite exulted. ... The overall assessment is that the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft is in really fine shape,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON>. He said that on Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>'s computer memory could be disrupted by radiation from a solar flare that erupted on the sun Thursday. If so, the computer should correct itself as it is designed to do. If not, the ground will do it. The radiation dose should be greater than the spacecraft will encounter at <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> said, and thus will be a good test of the vehicle. `` This will give <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> the smart robot a chance to prove how smart it is,'' he said. `` We've got a full day planned for you,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> told the astronauts, and even before they had breakfast, they were asked to take pictures of the Straits of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> for the IMAX film. The wakeup songs were from colleges attended by the three mission specialists on board, `` <ORGANIZATION> Boomer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sooners </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> UConn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huskies </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` Victory March.'' <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON> attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. The crew continued experiments that measure Earth's damaged ozone layer and study the effects of weightlessness on the human body, the processing of polymers and the growth of corn and ice crystals.

 A hospital is n't normally the ideal spot for celebrating a second birthday, but <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> and her son, <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON>, did just that Friday because she credits two liver transplants for saving her son's life. `` I'm very, very happy. I think my son's life, and my life, were saved by the operations,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, no relation to the professional golfer of the same name, said at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` I tell you, if he was n't alive, I would n't be either, because you go through so much in something like this.'' <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> was found in the first month of his life to have a potentially fatal disease called biliary atresia, characterized by the absence or degeneration of the liver's bile ducts and failure of the liver. Surgeons at Children's Hospital performed two operations on <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> in November 1988, surgically paring down larger livers to place in his body. The first liver was rejected. Doctors transplanted the second liver, then removed <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON>'s spleen a day later to prevent his body from rejecting the organ Doctors and Mrs. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said Friday they are pleased with the boy's progress, even though he suffered from the flu. He will remain on medication for life that helps keep his body from rejecting the transplanted liver. Today, he is an active, normal child, his mother said.

 Like storm-tossed captains plotting a course around rocks and shoals, a million <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area workers _ their normal commute routes ruined by an earthquake _ are devising new strategies for getting to and from work. `` I really do n't see how there can not be gridlock on Monday,'' said a harried <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvey </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Franchise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> worker now assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Monday is considered the region's transportation equivalent of D-day along 70 miles from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. It includes a plan for using <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> landing craft to ferry commuters between <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where four freeways and high-speed connectors are closed. For much of the work force, commute times are expected to stretch into an extra hour or more each way. The <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION>, the railroad that travels under <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to connect the city with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> communities, is running extra cars and expanding to 24-hour operation. Daily <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> business is expected to double to at least 300,000 person-trips. Morning comute tolls have been eliminated on all transbay bridges except the Golden Gate, where commuters will be excused from tolls on Friday mornings only. By far the most serious disruption is to the traffic _ 243,000 vehicles each working day _ normally carried by the key eight-mile-long <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. It a major <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lifeline for food, industrial and other goods, vehicular traffic from the east, and some half-million people a day. Tuesday's quake dumped a 50-foot section of the bridge's top deck onto the bottom deck of the 52-year-old span, and engineers estimated repairs might take as long as two months. A driver who normally takes the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> must now either go 20 miles south and then cross the bay on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, or take the <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> and drive 18 miles north in <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to cross the bay on the <LOCATION> Richmond-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. The southern route costs an extra 60 miles, the northern detour an additional 40 miles. In <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, the upper deck of a 1 \ - mile portion of Interstate 880 collapsed onto the lower deck in a deadly vise of concrete The roadway, a conduit to and from the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, bay-side cities and points south, will be out of commission for at least two years. In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, 70 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the 20,000 people who cross the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> daily on State Highway 17 to work in <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> must seek alternate routes because landslides have closed that route. The recommended alternates from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>: South on 101 to Highway 152 west, then north to Highway 1 _ 40 miles extra; or, west from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> on Highway 9 _ 20 miles extra. <ORGANIZATION> Greyhound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday it had suspended bus service to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cupertino </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> because of the closure of Highway 17. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, central-city motorists used to zipping down the hills to the <PERSON> Gough </PERSON> and Oak street connectors to Highway 101 found the on-ramps closed because of structural damage to roadway underpinnings. They must now travel city streets for a mile or so to find southbound on-ramps. In addition, the city's Embarcadero Freeway, which runs on the edge of the bay, is closed because of structural failure. And the I-280 extension from downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to 101 near <LOCATION> Candlestick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> sustained structural failure and will be closed for several months. Those are the only two other double-deck freeways in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> besides I-880.

 Winning a court judgment does n't mean you'll get your money, because in real life things are n't necessarily as easy as they appear on the television show `` The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>,'' judge said. The show's popularity has made the public more aware of small-claims court, but also has contributed to some unfortunate misconceptions, judges said recently. In some metropolitan counties, the number of small claims has more than tripled during the 1980s. However, the legal process is not as simple as Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wapner </PERSON>, the black-robed hero of the TV show, sometimes makes it look. Although the show may be bogging down his court with claims, <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Chief Magistrate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodiford </PERSON> said it's providing him with better informed litigants. `` The public is getting much more intelligent about small claims, and ` The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>' has helped,'' he said. Except in collection of judgments. On TV, <PERSON> Wapner </PERSON> tells the winner how much money he'll collect, and the show's producers pay him. Not so in real life, where the individual must collect the judgment, sometimes by again going to court to get wages garnisheed. `` I remember one lady who walked up to me and said, ` Judge, which office do I go to to collect my money?''' <PERSON> Bodiford </PERSON> recalled. `` I said, ` Ma'am, you have to collect the money.' She was just incensed.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courts </ORGANIZATION> says the small-claims caseload has nearly doubled this decade. <PERSON> Wapner </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last summer to film a week's worth of shows with local litigants, acknowledged that his program has influenced Americans to flock to small-claims court in record numbers. `` But before our show, people did n't know that there was a small-claims court that they can go to, and now they do,'' <PERSON> Wapner </PERSON>, 69, said from his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> office. `` Now they can go to court and have their dispute settled by a judge and not through fisticuffs.'' In suburban <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Chief Magistrate <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is getting tired of hearing about <PERSON> Wapner </PERSON>. So, he now issues a standard warning at the start of each session in his small-claims court: `` Television is not real life.'' `` I ca n't tell you how many times I've been quoted Judge <PERSON> Wapner </PERSON> in court,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said.

 Police officers investigating reports that a teacher had sex with a 17-year-old student interrupted a school staff meeting, thumbing through hundreds of files and even examining trash. The search Oct. 3 at school district headquarters, and another one three days later at <ORGANIZATION> Bartlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> to sue the police and touched off a furor over privacy rights, police use of search warrants and the responsibility of school officials to deal with allegations of misconduct among staff members. Heightening interest in the dispute is the fact that onetime English and journalism teacher <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Satch </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, who resigned in August after school officials confronted him with the allegations of misconduct, was also a columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The 44-year-old <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, who won a national <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> parody contest in 1988, quit writing the column, which commented humorously on local politics and other topics, in late August. The newspaper did n't say why he left. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> has said only that he committed no crime and that `` some of the personalities involved are in hot pursuit simply because of who I am.'' `` There have been no charges filed, and I do n't know if charges will be filed,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. `` I'm not aware that there have been any allegations made that constitute violations of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> law.'' The dispute surrounding <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> did not become public until Oct. 3, when police, led by Chief <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>, interrupted a meeting at school district headquarters and searched through files and garbage for evidence of sexual misconduct. With another warrant, officers entered <ORGANIZATION> Bartlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 6 to look for samples of semen and hair in a music room. School administrators say the wide-ranging search violated the privacy of personnel, students and parents, and went beyond what was authorized by the court. An angry Superintendent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> said officers could have gotten the information they wanted simply by asking. The girl at the center of the investigation _ court transcripts made public this week suggest a second may have been involved _ was older than 16, the age of consent in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. But a separate state law cited in the search warrants bans sexual contact between adults in a position of trust and children under the age of 18. The law, however, does n't specify whether teaching is such a position of trust. For the public, questions about <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s activities appear to have been outdistanced by questions of school district and police ethics. School officials acknowledge that they first heard of the allegations last May, when a student claimed that another student had an affair with <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. Both he and the girl denied it, school officials say, and the matter was not pursued until the girl's family repeated the allegation this summer and <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> was confronted and resigned School district spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said appropriate reports were filed through the state youth services agency. The agency contacted police after learning of the allegations from the school district in September. But prosecutors suggest school officials were slow to report the allegations, and should not have tried to deal with them internally instead of going to the police early on. The school's former principal and the acting principal, in affidavits this week, denied that they were pressured by school officials not to report the allegations. They said a police investigators mispresented their statements during a hearing for search warrants. In a letter to the editor of both local newspapers, <PERSON> Oren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> argued that the school district `` is a well-oiled machine when it comes to protecting its employees even to the detriment of our students. I have no doubt whatsoever that the -LRB- police department -RRB- could not have gotten the evidence it sought by asking for it.'' Another school district critic, <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, said in a letter that the district was `` wasting our money'' suing the police, adding, `` This appears to me to be an attempt to discredit what may come to light.'' But to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, the school raid suggests a pathway for `` such action on any of our homes or businesses.'' `` If we do not protest this, we are essentially allowing the development of a police state,'' he said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The schools' suit assailing the actions of prosecutors and police may be just the the first legal maneuver in the <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> case. `` We are opposed to the search and we are exploring every legal option,'' said <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bollenbach </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which once counted <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> among its members, is prepared to join the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> in legal action, President <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, the district attorney's office and the police are saying little. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Branchflower </PERSON> on Tuesday declined to comment on the case. Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Udland </PERSON> would say only that police stand by their actions. `` Of course we believe we did the right thing,'' Udland said.

<HEAD>Premier Ozal Fails in Bid to Win First Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, running for president in defiance of growing protests, failed to receive the necessary majority for election Friday in a first ballot held at a parliament session boycotted by the opposition. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> received 247 votes from the 285 deputies of his <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the 450-member parliament. This would be enough to put him over on a third ballot Oct. 31, when a simple majority is sufficient but it fell short of the two-thirds majority of 300 required in the first two ballots. <PERSON> Fethi </PERSON> <PERSON> Celikbas </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> deputy who is the only candidate running against <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, garnered 18 votes, and the rest cast empty ballots. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> criticized the opposition boycott, saying it went against their constitutional duty. `` They should have named their own candidate and participated in the election,'' he told a news conference after the balloting. He said he planned to designate a new premier from his party within days after he takes over as president Nov. 9. That is when the seven-year term of President <PERSON> Kenan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evren </PERSON> expires. Four Motherland deputies have resigned from the party to protest <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s decision to run for president. <PERSON> Tinaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Titiz </PERSON>, a former tourism minister in the <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> government, said in his resignation statement Friday that he could not condone an election carried out without the participation of the opposition. Also empty were the seats reserved in the galleries for outgoing President <PERSON> Evren </PERSON>, leader of the 1980 military coup, and top military officials. The military, always a power behind presidential elections, has made clear it will stay out this time. Opposition parties and newspaper commentators claim <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> lacks a popular mandate since the <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> suffered a major defeat in local elections in March. The party came in third after the Social Democrats and the centrist <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of former Premier <PERSON> Suleyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Demirel </PERSON>, winning 21.75 percent of the votes. They also say <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, the first premier attempting to ascend to the presidency in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, can not be the nonpartisan head of state required by the constitution. <PERSON> Erdal </PERSON> <PERSON> Inonu </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, said they would consider resigning from the parliament en masse if this could stop <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>. If elected, <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> will be <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s eight president and the second who is not a former military man. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> was elected premier six years ago when his newly founded <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won the 1983 elections that restored civilian rule.

 A weekend of rain loomed as a threat in the mountains north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> where 60 houses, some of them the dream homes of <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> commuters, have tumbled off stilts or foundations in this hillside town and a score of others suffered severe damage. On Friday, a team of geologists advised occupants of 100 other houses that they could safely return. Fears of massive landslides had earlier prompted official urgings to evacuate, although many residents brushed them off. `` It's a dangerous area, but all my stuff is here. My dogs are here. I figured you go down with the ship. Where do you go?'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Viele </PERSON>, 27. The geologists determined that a jagged fissure which streaked through yards had caused only six of the 60 ruined houses near the top of <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> to tumble; the bedrock did not split, they said. The other damaged houses were shaken off their foundations by ground motion. Residents of more than 100 houses at the bottom of the road were told Friday evening the fissure seemed unlikely to cause the landslides that only hours before had seemed to threaten to sweep them away. `` They are calling it a slight fissure where the ground opened and shifted in a localized area,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Robustelli </PERSON>, assistant chief of the <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire district. `` They are not concerned about the mountain coming down at this point.'' The 6,800 people around <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> appear to be among the hardest hit by the earthquake and among the least willing to leave their homes, many of them built of redwood and glass and carrying pricetags in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. In recent years, the town was transformed from a mountain enclave of summer homes to a year-round community, with many residents working in the nearby technology corridor called <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. As experts made the rounds inspecting structures Friday, they counted 82 houses that suffered moderate structural damage to total loss, including the 60 at the top of the road. `` When you start to figure percentages of people and percentages of homes in the area compared to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, we have a greater percentage loss here, except for loss of life,'' said Fire Chief <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON>. `` We were very fortunate. We did n't have any deaths or serious injuries.'' With rain starting early Saturday morning and expected to last through the weekend, jittery residents remained concerned about the uncertain earth beneath their feet. State transit crews patched deep cracks in roads to try to prevent rain from washing away more soil and houses. The 100 houses at the lower end of narrow, twisting <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> were at the greatest risk because of deep cracks several inches wide in the pavement. About 60 homes at the upper end of the road have already shifted up to 4 feet off their foundations or have fallen off stilts that propped them on the mountainside. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellairs </PERSON>, whose home is built on a concrete slab, nevertheless was staying at a friend's trailer that officials considered out of danger of landslides. But she was contemplating going home, where officials warned it might not be safe. `` There is n't any doubt in my mind that if the mountain comes down, we'll lose our home,'' said Bottoms. `` I feel safer out of it, but it's more stressful being gone,'' she said. `` We're staying in a 25-foot trailer with four adults and four kids. It would be better to be stressed at home.''

 <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> farmers brushed snow off the pumpkins Friday, salt trucks made the rounds in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> utility crews cleared branches and repaired power lines downed in a freak storm a day earlier. The storm dumped more than 8 inches of snow in north-central <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> by Friday morning and 2 to 6 inches over much of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and southeast <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Farther south, cities in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> logged record lows and officials there fretted over finding shelters for the homeless. The snow was a mixed blessing for <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> farmers, whose crops had been damaged by previous frosts. `` It has pretty much stopped harvest,'' said <LOCATION> Greensburg </LOCATION> farmer <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Smiley </PERSON>. However, a <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> pathologist said the cold weather will suppress the growth of damaging molds. A tourist official for the <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> bemoaned the snow's abrupt intrusion on the foliage display that annually attracts thousands of leaf-peepers to the area 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. `` We just had a travel writer come in from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and he was disappointed there was no sunshine,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fredericksen </PERSON>, sales manager for the convention bureau. The winter preview appeared likely to leave as fast as it came. Highs in the mid-50s to low 70s were forecast for Saturday and Sunday for most of the Midwest. About 10,000 Cincinnati-area utility customers were still without power Friday afternoon. <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoecklin </PERSON> said about 350 workers were on the job, including tree-trimming contractors who were removing fallen limbs from power lines. <PERSON> Power </PERSON> was restored Friday to about 14,000 electricity customers in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>. About 17,000 people were without power in southern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, mostly in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area. Four to 6 inches of snow was reported in <LOCATION> Gaylord </LOCATION>, in the northern <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. Twenty trucks were out salting <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> roadways, said <PERSON> Kirstin </PERSON> <PERSON> Svare </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the city's Streets and Sanitation department, but warmth from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> kept the sleet from turning to snow. A freeze warning was in effect Friday night for all of northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, with temperatures across the region expected to drop overnight into the upper 20s to lower 30s. Plants that normally withstand cold temperatures may be damaged because the cold spell comes right after unseasonably warm weather, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Guy </PERSON>, a plant physiologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>. But frost is expected to extend only to <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, causing little impact on the citrus industry farther south, he said. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> broke a 34-year-old record low with a 58-degree reading. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> managed to set two records within 18 hours, a high of 92 Thursday and a low of 56 Friday. <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> bottomed out at 34, <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> chilled to 35, Apalachicola registered 42, <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> 44, and <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION> 46 _ all records for the day. An overnight freeze warning also was in effect for all of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The early cold weather sparked concern for shelter for the estimated 100,000 homeless in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area. Shelters normally do not open until Nov. 1, but emergency overflow shelters were opened Thursday. `` In the next couple of days we really have no provisions. Our shelters are packed and have been all summer,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Brockwell-Carey </PERSON>, housing manager at <ORGANIZATION> Cobb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

 After decades of soaring rates of skin cancer _ largely because of suntanning _ Americans finally may be wising up to the dangers of the bronzed look, a medical researcher says.

 When tragedy tore apart <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Link </PERSON>'s life, she struggled with anguish. Then anger. Finally, she turned her emotions into something else _ activism. She took up the fight for worker safety. It's little solace for the loss of her son, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON>, who died in an on-the-job accident, but she's devoted to the cause. So are her comrades who share her sorrow. There's <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeze </PERSON>. Her son, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, died trying to save <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hensinger </PERSON>. His son, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>, also was killed in the rescue attempt. And Sue Irish. Her son, <PERSON> Barney </PERSON>, died, too, rushing to help the others. And <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogle </PERSON>. Her son, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, the last man to come to his co-workers' aid, died last. After two days in a coma, his respirator was turned off. Five families buried sons, their futures unfulfilled, their fate bound in tragedy. Now, more than a year after the young men _ ages 19 to 29 _ died in a toxic fume accident at <ORGANIZATION> Bastian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, their parents are writing letters, calling lawmakers, rallying _ and pleading, `` Never again.'' `` If we can do any good, it gives us the satisfaction to know that the boys did n't die in vain,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Link </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't bring them back, but in their name, we can maybe help make it so these things do n't happen ever again And it gives us something to think about other than the tragedy.'' `` You're hoping you'll change things ... you'll get people to listen,'' <PERSON> Hensinger </PERSON> said. `` It's always worth a try. Only a fool sits back and does nothing.'' The families' goals are modest. No sweeping changes. Just a little more caution and a lot more accountability from employers. `` Even if one factory would be really safe, that would make us feel good,'' Mrs. Freeze said. The campaigners were brought together by the June 28, 1988, tragedy at <PERSON> Bastian </PERSON> when <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> was overcome by hydrogen cyanide fumes while cleaning a holding tank. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, a plant worker just four weeks, and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>, climbed in to help, investigators were told. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON>, once <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>'s schoolmate, valiantly tried to save them, according to reports. Then <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, the last rescuer, slid down the side of the tank, hitting his head, his mother said. The workers did n't know zinc cyanide residue was in the 5-by-4-by-5 tank, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bear </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Muriatic acid, a dilute form of hydrochloric acid, was used for the cleaning, he said, and the mixture produced the toxic gas. <ORGANIZATION> IOSHA </ORGANIZATION> fined <PERSON> Bastian </PERSON> $ 41,700, claiming it had n't provided adequate training, respirators or rescue equipment _ such as a lifeline to pull workers out _ nor conducted air tests in the tank before anyone entered. <PERSON> Bastian </PERSON> has contested the `` knowing'' violations and paid the remainder, totaling $ 1,700. It has declined further comment since releasing a statement shortly after the accident saying: `` We are sorry that it took a tragedy of these proportions to focus attention on the issue of industrial safety.'' The parents say they knew the job could be hazardous; their sons came home with arm or leg burns. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> even told his ex-wife `` ` If I do n't get out, the job's going to kill me,''' his father said. `` I took it as a figure of speech.'' After the accident, the families say <PERSON> Bastian </PERSON> made a terrible situation worse by not telling them what happened. `` We need answers,'' Miss Irish said. `` A lot of them.'' <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has been asked by a worker safety watchdog group to convene a grand jury probe of the accident, but has declined comment pending a report from the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. `` Five guys went to work and expected to return home,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Groth </PERSON>, the watchdog group's co-founder. `` They did n't. Something went drastically wrong.'' The families are frustrated, he added. `` They want to know why there was a delay in calling the ambulances. ... They ca n't find out what happened to their sons.'' With <PERSON> Groth </PERSON>'s guidance, the families have become activists, meeting with consumer groups, holding news conferences and lobbying for stronger <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> enforcement, changes in workers compensation laws and measures to allow injured employees to sue in cases where employers remove warnings or safety devices from machines. `` It's a good catharsis for them,'' said <PERSON> Groth </PERSON>. `` We've encouraged them to channel emotions in a positive way, through political action ...'' They're also consulting with a lawyer, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>, about the possibility of legal action, though with few exceptions, workers compensation is the exclusive remedy for on-the-job accidents. <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> says the families have been `` radicalized by the experience.'' At the same time, they've learned a hard civics lesson, discovering that government moves slowly, its agencies hamstrung by rules, laws and dollars. `` I always thought <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> inspected every place every year,'' Mrs. Freeze said. `` They do n't have the money or the inspectors to do everything. ... It's going to have to be the employer that's going to have to look out for his employees.'' `` You get so many slaps in the face, all the things you find out,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Link </PERSON> said. Workers compensation, for one. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> `` being a single person, all we got was $ 2,000 for funeral expenses. They do n't give you any compensation ... for the love you lost,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Link </PERSON> said. `` Not that any amount of money can bring him back.'' Together, the families took flowers to the graves on the first anniversary of the accident. It helps, but anger remains. `` They had their whole lives ahead of them. None of them were married,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fogle </PERSON> said. `` You have so many hopes and dreams for your children. You never think you're going to have to bury your children.'' Now five families live with memories. Of <PERSON> Barney </PERSON>, who stopped by each morning to tell his mother he loved her. Of <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, who had a twinkle in his eye and a passion for music. Of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, who tinkered with cars and hoped to become a diesel mechanic. Of <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON>, who loved the mountains. His parents plan to etch scenes of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> on his gravestone. And of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>, whose tombstone reads: `` He gave his life for a comrade.'' `` You've got to go on,'' his father said, `` or it will eat you up.'' The families are trying to do that, confident their sons would be proud of their crusade. `` <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> would say, ` All right, Mom!,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fogle </PERSON> said. `` I can just hear him say, ` Go for it!'''

 Imagine working in a factory where dense smoke and gases make it hard to see or breathe, toxic dusts coat the floor and the heat in some spots approaches 250 degrees _ beyond boiling water. This is n't a 19th-century sweatshop but, prosecutors claim, a modern-day plant, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magnet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a place so hazardous that the people who ran it were nothing short of criminal. Five current and former <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magnet </ORGANIZATION> executives await trial on charges that they knowingly allowed conditions that gave more than 40 workers nerve and lung disorders and other ailments. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused this month to hear their appeal, challenging local prosecutors' jurisdiction. This case is among a small but growing number of criminal charges filed against company officials for workplace deaths and injuries. There have been others in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the latter the site of the nation's first corporate murder convictions for an employee's cyanide poisoning `` We're likely to see more criminal prosecutions in this area,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzhauer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> law school lecturer. Some prosecutors argue that monetary penalties imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> are often too small to deter employers. `` Some people do n't care if they're fined. They pass that along to the consumer,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkerson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Magnet case. `` People do care about going to jail for 25 years.'' `` This is not applying a different standard to employers than we apply to every other citizen,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Oden </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Travis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` You ca n't drive 120 miles an hour out of a school zone, run over a child and say you ca n't be criminally responsible because you did n't intend the results.'' But opponents say this approach could lead to a patchwork of local and state safety standards and undercuts <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, which has referred 55 cases to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for criminal prosecution since its formation in 1970. About a quarter were settled in pleas or trials, and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> declined prosecution in the rest, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said. Workplace prosecutions are `` basically unfair to business and I do n't think it advances workers' safety and health,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bokat </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> general counsel. `` Corporate executives have no warning of what's expected of them,'' added <PERSON> Bokat </PERSON>, who filed a brief in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Magnet case. `` It's really an after-the-fact determination by a prosecutor that something's not safe.'' A key contention in this debate _ that <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> pre-empts local prosecutions _ reached the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after being rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which said `` state criminal law can provide a valuable and forceful supplement'' for worker protection. Attorneys for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Magnet argued that local prosecutors and juries, who may be `` uninformed and ... unconcerned,'' are less qualified to ensure safety than experienced federal officials who set uniform standards. `` Whether criminal laws should be applied is a legislative decision,'' added attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>. `` If -LRB- you -RRB- want to do something, change the law.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> let stand the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> ruling. The pre-emption issue did n't stop the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office, which has a special unit for such cases. Four people convicted of involuntary manslaughter have served jail terms and nearly 30 misdemeanors have been prosecuted, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Macksoud </PERSON>, deputy district attorney. `` These are cases where the employers were just cutting corners more than anything,'' he said. `` They thought they could get away with it. ... -LRB- But -RRB- they kill people by cutting corners.'' The average fine ranges from $ 11,000 to $ 30,000, <PERSON> Macksoud </PERSON> added, about five times higher than <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s civil penalties. Despite some successes, prosecutors filing criminal charges in workplace accident cases are trying `` to put new wine in an old bottle,'' in the view of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Maakestead </PERSON>, associate professor of business law and management at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who does not expect a proliferation of prosecutions. `` These cases tend to be the more expensive, the more time consuming'' and require investigative expertise often lacking in prosecutors' offices, he said, terming effective <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> standards a better way to ensure safety. Even so, he added, `` in egregious cases, you need that kind of symbolic legal mechanism to send a strong signal.'' Experts say that message was sent in the 1985 landmark murder conviction of three officials of <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> in the cyanide poisoning of <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Golab </PERSON>, a Polish immigrant working in the silver recovery plant. <PERSON> Golab </PERSON> had to work over open vats of cyanide solution but was n't informed of the risks or given adequate protective gear _ prosecutors said paper masks were provided He also was refused a transfer after showing cyanide exposure symptoms. Workers testified they suffered headaches, dizziness and vomiting. One said the only time respirators were provided was when an inspector visited. Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> called <PERSON> Golab </PERSON>'s death `` not accidental, but in fact murder.'' The convictions are being appealed. In the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Magnet case, the company and five officials are accused of aggravated battery, reckless conduct and conspiracy. Prosecutors said the plant was comparable to `` the ` sweat shops' of the mid-19th century.'' `` Abominable'' was prosecutor <PERSON> Parkerson </PERSON>'s description of conditions at the plant where wire was coated with polyvinyl chloride and other chemicals. Court papers claim temperatures on the catwalks approached 250 degrees, the air was smoky, workers were n't given adequate masks, gloves or boots, they were exposed to the kinds of gases used as weapons during World War I and were hit in the chest, face, head and neck with broken wire fragments. Prosecutors claim 43 workers suffered nerve disorders, impotence, kidney failure, toxic hepatitis or other injuries. One doctor said the combination of aluminum dust on the floor and another chemical used at the hot plant causes brain damage and is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Until 1982, <PERSON> Parkerson </PERSON> said, the plant averaged more than four times as many injuries as employees. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said it last inspected <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Magnet in August 1988 and no citations were issued. Four citations in the previous 12 years, alleging noise violations, failure to inspect respirators and other infractions, were settled for minimal amounts. The defense has thus far addressed only pre-emption. But <PERSON> Bokat </PERSON>'s brief says the state `` has never contested the defendants' claim that working conditions were in compliance with <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> standards. <PERSON> Parkerson </PERSON> said the opportunity has n't arisen yet. `` <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> just ca n't deal with people who have no intention of following the law at all,'' he said. `` The basic problem is the whole mentality of the business, which deals only in money, profits and losses and accepts the idea implicitly that human health, safety and life is expendable to some degree. We've got to change that kind of attitude.''

 Criminal prosecutions have been initiated in a wide variety of work-related deaths and injuries.

Prosecutors want to try a company foreman on involuntary manslaughter charges, claiming he knew the van the man died in had a faulty exhaust system. Two lower courts have ruled opposite ways on the evidence issue. <LOCATION> WISCONSIN </LOCATION> _ A jury convicted a company of reckless homicide in the death of a man who drove a front-end loader off a 60-foot cliff. The company, the prosecutor said, knew the man had a history of epilepsy, provided less than 40 hours of training and had no on-site supervisor. Another company pleaded no contest to an endangerment charge and was fined in the death of a worker killed in a crane collapse. <LOCATION> TEXAS </LOCATION> _ Two construction companies and one executive were convicted of criminally negligent homicide in the deaths of three workers in separate trench cave-ins. The three convictions were overturned on the ground that state law was pre-empted by federal occupational safety regulations. They are being appealed. A third company has been charged in a similar case. <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION> _ An appeal is pending in the assault convictions of two executives of <ORGANIZATION> Pymm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thermometer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for exposing workers to toxic mercury. A judge dismissed the verdict on pre-emption grounds.

<HEAD>Estefan's Return to Roots Turns Nice Gesture Into Smart Business</HEAD>

 With the recording of two of the Miaimi Sound Machine's latest songs in Spanish as well as English, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON>'s return to her roots is not only a nice gesture, but smart business. <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON>, a Cuban immigrant, recorded and released her hit song `` Do n't Want to Lose You'' in English and Spanish this summer. Another song, `` Oye Mi Canto'' -LRB- `` Hear My Voice'' -RRB-, was just released in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with the bilingual touch. Even the music videos were done in both languages. `` I just thought it was a little plus,'' <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON> said prior to leaving on a European concert tour. `` I do n't want to alienate my <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> fans because they have been good to me for a long time.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> is one of the first major rock groups to put both a Spanish and English version of the same song on one LP. `` Cuts Both Ways'' has hit the top of the charts, and the compact discs and cassettes have the two different versions. `` What is happening for the Spanish-speaking people is they feel proud about it because you did n't forget them, so you identify with them,'' said <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON>'s husband and music producer who also is a Cuban immigrant. `` For the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, it's something new And they like it.'' That tested true when <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON> and the group recorded and released `` Anything for You'' in both English and Spanish a couple of years ago. `` ` Anything for You,' in English was a hit, and the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> version gave it that final kick,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stessel </PERSON>, vice president of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> operations in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for CBS records, the label that distributes the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Sound Machine. That `` final kick,'' perhaps, is coming from the growing audience of Hispanics in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> estimates the country's Hispanic popluation will have grown by 34.5 in the last 10 years. Yet, the total population is expected to have grown only 9.9 percent. And that Hispanic population is younger than the overall population, which translates into more sales and more exposure. Irish rocker <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Branigan </PERSON> said she hopes to capture a bigger Hispanic market by making two separate albums. <PERSON> Branigan </PERSON>, who recorded `` Gloria'' in 1982, is working on two albums that will have the same music but English lyrics on one and Spanish on the other. Other artists also have cashed in on the growing market. Most artists have taken their hit English songs and then translated them into Spanish, such as <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> who did her Top 10 hit `` Luka,'' and Sting who did the same with `` Fragile.'' But few if any have put the Spanish-version songs on a new album and released the songs to radio listeners in both languages at the same time, <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON> said. `` We do n't do it because it's more commercial or because we want to sell more albums. We do it because it's very natural for us,'' <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON> said. `` People feel proud about it, and we feel very lucky that we've been able to do something for our people.'' And it's that sensitivity that makes <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Sound Machine unique, <PERSON> Stessel </PERSON> said. If <PERSON> Bon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovi </PERSON> wanted to record and release a song in both English and Spanish, <PERSON> Stessel </PERSON> said it might not work as well. `` I do n't think that it's necessarily where rock' n' roll is going. I think if gets back to what comes naturally,'' <PERSON> Stessel </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Gloria </LOCATION> does it because she's Cuban. This is something she does naturally.''

<HEAD>In Its Second Decade, Face of AIDS Will Change</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The frightening scourge of the'80s, AIDS, is not likely to be defeated in the'90s. But new weapons may give its victims a fighting chance. This is one of a periodic series of articles, `` The'90s,'' looking ahead to the promise and peril of the upcoming decade, in the environment, medicine, technology and society.

<TEXT>
 In the 1980s, AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was largely an untreatable disease of middle-class white homosexuals. In the 1990s, it is likely to be a treatable disease of poor black and Hispanic heterosexuals. And worldwide, by the end of the'90s, six million people may be ill with AIDS, the specialists project. In the second decade of this epidemic upon the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, the face of AIDS will change: _ It will be increasingly linked with poverty, passed through the nation's slums via needles and sex _ The number of people with AIDS will grow dramatically as those who were infected throughout the 1980s fall sick _ Medical science will develop more tools to control HIV, the AIDS virus, perhaps slowing the lethal course of the infection As acquired immune deficiency syndrome spreads, the burden upon society will grow with it. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government estimates the cost of taking care of AIDS patients in 1992 will range from $ 5 billion to $ 13 billion. Big-city hospitals, especially those in poor neighborhoods, will be hit hardest. Experts believe <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> will need 1,000 to 1,500 more beds by 1991 just to deal with AIDS patients. The seeds of the epidemic's next decade have already been sown. An estimated 1 million to 1.5 million Americans are now infected. Most, perhaps all, will eventually become ill. `` Even if not another single person gets infected, which of course wo n't happen, there will be a steady increase in the number of people who get sick and die from AIDS over the next 10 years,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> By the end of 1992, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> projects, 365,000 Americans will have gotten AIDS, and 263,000 of them will have died. In 1992 alone, there will be 80,000 new cases of AIDS and 65,000 deaths. The virus typically lingers quietly for a decade after the initial infection until it eventually destroys the immune system, causing AIDS. The victims of the early 1990s will be the legacy of the epidemic's silent but explosive start in the early 1980s. Most early victims were homosexual men. Because of safer sex habits, the rate of new infections has slowed to a trickle among this group. But the virus continues to spread through shared needles among drug addicts, largely poor black and Hispanic males in the big cities, and from them to their sex partners, mostly women. The future of AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will depend, in part, on whether those who catch AIDS through sex with drug abusers will pass it on sexually to others. If this happens _ there is no evidence of it yet _ AIDS could become a sexually transmitted disease of the urban poor. `` That's the big question mark that hangs over the next decade,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The heterosexual transmission of AIDS is already a major problem in other parts of the world, especially <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where 10 percent to 15 percent of the people in some cities are thought to be infected. `` We expect that the decade of the 1990s will be worse _ and perhaps much worse _ than the 1980s,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS program. The WHO has put together the educated guesses of many experts and projects that nine times more people around the world will get AIDS during the 1990s than during the 1980s. By the year 2000, there could be 6 million AIDS cases, and 18 million people could be infected. Just how many people will have AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a decade from now is impossible to predict with any certainty. `` What happens 10 years from now will reflect transmission that has n't yet occurred,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are a lot of unknowns, but to me the biggest _ because it's likely to have the most radical change _ is the impact of preventive therapy in infected people to prevent the onset of AIDS.'' Recently, researchers showed that the drug AZT can forestall the development of AIDS in infected people who are not yet sick. If all goes as scientists hope, other drugs under development will attack the virus at various stages in its life cycle. The goal is to hold the virus in check. `` HIV infection would become a chronic disease, a lifelong disease, something for which you would need to take medication for a long time, like hypertension or diabetes,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases. `` Some people will still do poorly, but hopefully the majority will be able to do much better.'' Instead of succumbing to AIDS 10 years after infection, people might live with the virus in relatively good health for 20 or 30 years. Many experts are less optimistic about finding a vaccine that will protect people from the initial AIDS infection. The difficulty is in priming the body to put up impenetrable barriers that will prevent every single invading virus from taking root in vulnerable blood cells. `` We know it's going to be exceedingly difficult, based on all the immune information that has been generated,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cedars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` It looks harder, rather than easier, as we learn more and more.''

 Party flags, T-shirts and posters, paraphernalia of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence-election campaign, abound in this remote outpost of the diminutive Bushmen, the territory's earliest inhabitants But the crucial issue among them is not independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>; it's survival. Bushman farmers, limited to a fraction of their traditional territory, hope to retain enough land to raise themselves just to subsistence levels when <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> becomes independent after the voting Nov. 7-11. Those Bushmen who fought for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> during a 23-year war against pro-independence guerrillas in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, are living off their last military paychecks and waiting to hear the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for their future. Others languish in the slums of <PERSON> Bushmanland </PERSON>'s only town, <LOCATION> Tshumkwe </LOCATION>. The third smallest of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s 11 ethnic groups, the 33,000 Bushmen have never been united politically. They are scattered across an arid territory and speak a half-dozen languages, including Afrikaans, the language of the majority of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s whites Thirty years ago, some Namibian Bushmen survived solely by hunting and gathering, as did their ancestors. Today, even the Ju @ wa in eastern Bushmanland, the only group still in possession of its traditional hunting grounds, must raise cattle and vegetables to survive. <PERSON> Toma </PERSON>, a young <PERSON> Bushman </PERSON> who speaks Afrikaans as well as Ju @ wa's clicking language, said the elections mark the first time his people have been wooed by political parties He hopes independence will bring a high school and more shops in <LOCATION> Tshumkwe </LOCATION>, a job for him, and a better house for his family in the tiny, grass-hut village of <LOCATION> Gautcha </LOCATION>. The United Nations-supervised elections will determine the make-up of a constitution-writing assembly. Independence, after 74 years of South African rule, will come once the constitution and new government are in place. Although elections are new to the Bushmen, they know the rural development policies of the new government could affect them dramatically. They have been invited to community meetings by officials of the <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> People's Organization -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, the guerrilla movement that is the front-runner in the campaign. They have received free food and T-shirts from supporters of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s main rival, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> says it plans to redistribute unused or foreign-owned land to those without property, but <PERSON> Theo-Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> official, said the party wants to get away from ethnic stereotypes. He added that he believes Bushmen have become the focus of what he calls disproportionate and misguided concern, particularly abroad, over what might happen to the Bushmen, their traditions and cultures. `` We do not want to lock them in a zoo for foreigners to come and experiment on how they used to live,'' <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON> said. `` We're going to look at them as citizens of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> whose needs should be attended to. <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON> condemned as `` sinister'' suggestions by South African officials to move to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bushmen </LOCATION> soldiers worried about their future in independent <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Erno </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauerke </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, said Bushmen were struggling through a difficult transition from traditional to modern society. He said his party, a multiracial, pro-capitalist coalition, would try to promote rural agricultural development and a shift from communal to private land use. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ju </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> @ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> wa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bushman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said the Bushmen now are <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s equivalent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s `` untouchables. But he said increasing numbers of other Namibians could face similar hardship unless economic trends are reversed. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, an American filmmaker and anthropolgist whose organization seeks to promote small-scale farming projects in <LOCATION> Bushmanland </LOCATION>, said the Bushmen are trapped between outsiders' sentimental views that they should be protected from the modern world and the reality of their poverty They face `` death by myth,'' he said, when what they want is a chance to achieve self-sufficiency. The Namibian Bushman population has declined at a rate of about 5 percent every 10 years, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Ferdie </PERSON> <PERSON> Weich </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, who has done missionary work in several Bushmen communities, said illiteracy is widespread. `` At school, there's a certain amount of unidentifiable discrimination against the Bushmen,'' he said. Because of the scarcity of teachers who speak their languages, <PERSON> Bushman </PERSON> children are taught in <LOCATION> Afrikaans </LOCATION>. The Bushmen will be dependent for several generations on outside financial help and on the perserverance of those who try to assist them, <PERSON> Weich </PERSON> said. The Ju @ wa foundation has helped establish 20 new villages in <LOCATION> Bushmanland </LOCATION> where residents tend gardens and raise cattle as well as hunt and gather. Project director <PERSON> Megan </PERSON> <PERSON> Biesele </PERSON> said the farming cooperative they have formed is an attempt to translate their ancient system of land use into modern terms to gain leasehold over the area. The foundation hopes to establish 15 more villages of 30 to 35 people each and to improve education and health services.

<HEAD>Bulldozers Chance Upon Ancient Buried City on Egyptian Coast</HEAD>

 Construction workers carving out a road for an elite <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> resort bulldozed their way into an ancient world under a blanket of seaside sand. They had stumbled upon a city more than 2,000 years old and stretching for more than a mile along <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s coastline 125 miles west of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>. `` It's unbelievable,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, who controls <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> operations in the region. `` Other countries get excited about finding an ancient house. We have a whole city. It's without equal in all of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.'' The bulldozers were stopped a month after the ruins were discovered in 1985. By that time, a road had been sliced through what appears to have been an ancient temple, but much more remained. A few months later, Egyptian and Polish archaeologists began excavating the ruins, without letting word out, and what they've found over the last three years is in remarkable condition `` What we have in hand is a golden egg, undisturbed, a complete city that changed with time,'' said <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, director general of Pharaonic monuments. `` It's not only a city of the dead, but also a city of the living, side by side. It's something very rare and very important.'' The city, believed to have been founded in the second century B.C., lasted more than 500 years. As excavators intruded on its serenity since 1986, antiquities officials have worked quietly in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to save the site from further destruction. The still-unidentified city now peeks in and out of its sandy grave. To one side stands a row of ultramodern apartments built along the coastline by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION>. A new apartment complex was to have been erected on top of what turned out to be the ruins. `` The site is under our protection,'' said <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON>, chairman of the antiquities organization. `` Nothing can happen to it now.'' Only a small area has been excavated, but archaeologists already have discovered well-preserved houses, vast cemeteries with decorated and undecorated tombs, catacombs, a bath, a basilica and many artifacts, imported and local, including statues and frescoes. Egyptian excavators are now at work. In February they'll be rejoined by 10 Polish archaeologists and restorers to make detailed surveys of the site and its needs. They already have restored critical pieces that had begun to disintegrate since the bulldozing of the road. Walking through the excavations, <PERSON> Feisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashmy </PERSON>, the antiquities inspector in charge of the ancient city, pointed toward mounds of toppled marble columns. They lay at the crest of a man-made ditch 35 feet wide and 10 feet deep _ an ancient road. `` Before the bulldozers got here, this was a temple, I think. It's terrible, but we now have to focus on saving what's left,'' he said. `` There's so much. All you have to do is to look down, and history says, ` Take me.''' Early historians recorded a number of small coastal cities along <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coastline. Villages of white houses, fishing boats and nets, and later the domes of early Christian churches, dotted the landscape. Vineyards, olive groves, fruit trees and almonds were plentiful. Families on outings sailed to outlying islands to drink wine. W.A. <PERSON> Daszewski </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institite </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and an expert in the Greco-Roman period, said he's delighted with the find. `` This is a great opportunity for us to see how it was. It's a unique chance to understand the quality of housing during this period,'' he said in an interview. `` This was a landowners' city. ... They probably had farms inland, but residents preferred to have their houses along the coast because of the cooler climate.'' Excavated houses are large, with complex systems that carried rainwater from the roof to basement cisterns. Some are elaborately decorated with pillars, niches, statues and delicate frescoes. `` The architectural decoration in the city is first class and well-preserved,'' <PERSON> Daszewski </PERSON> said. Designs on tombs range from simple pits through small step pyramids to magnificent, multistoried funerary complexes. <PERSON> Daszewski </PERSON> said burials date from the second century B.C. to the end of the third century A.D., but he believes the city existed in some form until the early seventh century. <PERSON> Daszewski </PERSON> said he knows of two possible names for the city: <LOCATION> Leucaspis </LOCATION> _ white shield _ which would refer to a sandspit that protected the harbor; and Antiphre or <LOCATION> Antiphra </LOCATION>, a city mentioned as late as the fourth century A.D. because of a bishop who hailed from there. `` Both are possibilities, but we have a basilica here, so the city existed during early Christian times,'' <PERSON> Daszewski </PERSON> said. `` I rather think it's Antiphre, but it's possible the city was called one thing, the harbor area another. We do n't know.'' The Polish and Egyptian archaeologists predict it'll be years before excavation and restoration is completed. `` Maybe 10, maybe 15, maybe more,'' said antiquities official <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, still a fledgling event its third time around, is making its mark by awarding the largest cash prize at any film festival to young and first-time filmmakers from around the world. This year, <PERSON> Idrissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouedraogo </PERSON> of <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION> Sakura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> prize of $ 143,000 for `` Yaaba'' -LRB- `` Old Woman'' -RRB-. The Sakura Silver prize of $ 71,000 went to <PERSON> Shunichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagasaki </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for `` The Enchantment.'' The 30 million yen -LRB- $ 214,000 -RRB- prize represents a significant amount of freedom, said director <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> -LRB- `` Witches of Eastwick,'' `` Mad Max'' -RRB-, a member of the jury that also included actor <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>. `` I do n't know any young filmmaker who would n't regard that amount of money as something very useful to their career,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` I think the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> festival may become known as a major attraction for young directors because of the money as well as the recognition.'' The 10-day festival ended Oct. 8 with `` Dead Poets Society,'' starring <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. It presented 133 movies, including <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON>'s `` Breaking In,'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s `` Parenthood'' and <ORGANIZATION> Yahoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serious </ORGANIZATION>' `` Young <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>.'' The grand prize went to `` That Summer of White Roses'' by <PERSON> Rajko </PERSON> <PERSON> Grlic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. A Special Jury Prize was given to `` Intergirl'' by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Pyotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Todorovsky </PERSON>. Other winners included: <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovleva </PERSON>, `` Intergirl'' -LRB- best actress -RRB-; and <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>, `` A Dry White Season'' -LRB- best actor -RRB-. The Young Cinema Competition was established at the first <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> festival in 1985 to encourage young directors with cash prizes of $ 1.5 million. But the cash prize shrunk after festival organizers discovered that some of the winners were constrained at home in using the money solely for new film projects, and others subsequently produced less-than-commercial movies with the money. Still, the competition is an attraction to young directors. Some 327 movies were entered in this year's festival, and the field was narrowed to 17 films from 14 countries. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Festival, held every other year, is still trying to find its place among the more glamorous and prestigious film festivals of the world, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> event is neither a center of behind-the-scenes dealmaking nor a site of many important world premieres. `` The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> festival is purely a matter of international prestige,'' said <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolentino </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> correspondent for the French entertainment magazine <PERSON> Telerama </PERSON>. `` No one makes deals here, and most of the films have been seen before at other festivals. Producers and film distributors might touch base, but it's all public relations,'' he said. But festival organizers saw an opportunity to boost the film projects of fledgling directors using one thing of which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has plenty: money. `` We're certainly not the first film festival, so we started the young cinema competition because we wanted to be known for something special,'' said <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morioka </PERSON>, director of the festival's `` Young Cinema Competition.'' `` We regard it as very important to aid the abilities and talents of young filmmakers,'' said <LOCATION> Morioka </LOCATION>, a former producer with <ORGANIZATION> Toho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s major movie companies. The fesitval costs about $ 5 million and about 10 percent comes from the government. Because of the high costs, it is n't an annual event such as most international film gatherings. The world's biggest and most publicity-prone film fesitval, at <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION>, now gives $ 39,000 to the winner of its young director's award, and the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, festival awards 50,000 Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 42,700 -RRB- to the best first film Another feature of the young cinema competition is that directors, and often actors, attend public showings of their films and appear onstage afterwards to discuss the movie with the audience. During one such discussion, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochant </PERSON>, the 28-year-old director of `` Tough Life,'' was told by a young man that in the Japanese studio system, an aspiring film director must labor as long as 15 or 20 years before getting the chance to make his own feature-length film. <PERSON> Rochant </PERSON> said he, too, had to fight the odds, and to circumvent the usual way of making a film in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to create `` Tough Life,'' the story of a young Parisian's alienation from life and love. `` In cinema, you must take risks like in everything else. The only way to do it is to do it,'' he said.

 After 6 -LCB- years with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, more than two of those with the now-extinct `` West 57th'' series, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> quit. Her star was rising then. But her patience with the gypsy life had fallen. `` I'd had it with traveling 250,000 miles a year,'' she said. The pay was good. She got to cover a small war, among other things, and was a summer-substitute anchor in 1984 on the `` CBS Evening News.'' But she was always on the go. It seemed altogether checkout time, she says, when she realized that `` my close personal friends were taxi drivers and car rental people.'' Now, having moved to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and served as host for two `` People'' magazine TV specials since leaving <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, she is starting life anew in cable, in her own one-hour weekday talk show on the Lifetime network. `` The <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> Show'' is the new job. Premiering today, it's taped with a studio audience in <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> One audience member at her first taping: <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> <PERSON> Vieira </PERSON>, now with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 60 Minutes. A class act, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said of her old `` West 57th'' colleague and pal. She spoke by phone last week while changing her clothes for the second show of the day. `` I'm trying to get my shirt over my head, hang on,'' she said, laughing. Her new network says it serves nearly 44 million of the nation's 50.9 million homes with cable Its programming seeks a female audience. But she says her show _ which she eventually hopes to do live _ wo n't do issues `` that you would stereotypically define as women's issues all the time We just finished taping one about mothers on crack. `` And we're about to do a show on <PERSON> Phoebe </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, who has spent the last eight years raising a handicapped child. Which is why she dropped out of music. The show's not exclusively aimed at women.'' Sure, Lifetime, partly owned by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` is a woman's network,'' she says. `` But it's not as if a man tunes in, he's going to get a ... rash. We're looking to broaden what women's issues are considered to be.'' Perhaps the only talk show host around nowadays with a degree in political science from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, has paid her journalistic dues. She worked as a general assignment reporter at stations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and here before joining <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in 1981. She has a breezy, no-nonsense manner and a sense of humor that at times can be, well, salty. A few million viewers noticed this one day in 1984 when, while subanchoring `` The CBS Morning News,'' she emitted an opinion that became a highlight on a much-copied tape of Great Moments in Broadcasting. She had been discussing a sci-fi movie with the show's other fill-in anchor, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Plante </PERSON>. Props from the film were put on their desk. She and <PERSON> Plante </PERSON> were told they had four minutes to fill and to discuss the props. They did, but it was n't easy. Finally, when she thought the show had cut to a commercial, she turned to <PERSON> Plante </PERSON>, she recalls, and said, `` I could n't booshwah about this another minute if my life depended on it.'' -LRB- She used a naughtier word than booshwah. We have changed the word to protect the innocent. -RRB- The studio became `` hush-quiet,'' she said. `` I had to say to a technician, ` Excuse me, did that go out on the air? Because I sure did n't mean for it to.''' It sure went out on the air, the technician said. After the commercials, a chastened <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> apologized on the air. A few industry observers and inmates subsequently thought she had been knocking the show. Not so, she says. `` In fact, I was just saying that I could n't keep babbling about nothing.'' In some TV circles, such heresy would prompt demands she be impaled on a Nielsen point. Be that as it may, would she ever want to return to life as a network correspondent? `` I have missed some of the people and some of the work,'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> replied. `` I have to say that to be honest ... and there are times I miss investigative reporting the most. `` At the same time, do I want to come back to that life? Uh, no.''

<HEAD>Wariness About The Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The world's first mass-consumption society emerged in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 20th century, greatly raised the material standard of living and reinforced the people's innate optimism. Studying the phenomenon, some behavioral scientists found that Americans could be distinguished from their European cousins simply by their level of optimism. Americans expected things to get better; others were n't sure. Into the 1970s, studies showed Americans usually expected to be better off financially in the future and to have more material comforts. They expected to do better than their parents, and their children to do better than them. Why not? In the years after World War II many millions of jobs were created, real incomes rose, people could afford cars and houses and invest in stocks and bonds. They earned pension rights. They had medical insurance. But something also may have happened to that optimism. In a survey whose intent was to examine hopes and fears for the 1990s, hundreds of Americans revealed a persistent strain of wariness or realism that has become mixed with the traditional high hopes and confidence. `` The 1990s will be a decade in which the American public is not without optimism, but neither are they without pessimism,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennack </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, in announcing the results. `` We have discovered that, overall, people have what I believe must be characterized as a somber view of the 1990s,'' he said. <PERSON> Bennack </PERSON> is president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, which for the past six years has commissioned studies of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> attitudes on major issues. By its nature, this one looked into the future, a gray one. The largest percentage of those surveyed, some 38 percent, expressed the opinion that the American standard of living will stay the same; 29 percent said it would decline. A minority, 31 percent, said it would improve. The same doubts appeared elsewhere in the survey. Forty-one percent said their personal life would be better than now in the year 2000, but 31 percent said it would be about the same and 23 percent expected it to be worse. Thirty-eight percent said they felt the financial standard of living for all Americans would stay about the same in the 1990s, 29 percent said it would decline and only 31 percent said they expected improvement. The survey itself revealed some of the economic reasons for apprehension. The national deficit was cited by 30 percent as the single greatest threat to the economy. Others named the trade imbalance. Few named recession. Forty-six percent of the respondents held the view that prices of single-family houses will be much higher 10 years from now, a fear that contrasts with professional opinion that housing demand will ease after the mid-1990s. Asked their opinion of the emerging <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, scheduled to become effective in 1992, about three in five said it would create trade and economic problems for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Problems? Not opportunities? Other areas of the survey suggested more reasons for the mixed views about the future. Based on the survey, <PERSON> Bennack </PERSON> said more than half the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public expects terrorism will become a major problem within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A roughly similar percentage agreed that the 1990s would be `` a decade of peace interrupted occasionally by regional military conflict.'' <PERSON> Bennack </PERSON> summed it up this way: `` -LRB- People -RRB- feel relatively confident about their own lives but confidence about ` the big picture' eludes them; there's an element of uncertainty, even pessimism, concerning our society's future.'' Affluence, it seems, has made people concerned about assets and greater education has made them aware of the frail fabric of society. They want more than goods. A mass consumption society solves problems _ and creates them too.

 Music and laughter drift into the streets from restaurants and nightspots one month after Hurricane Hugo slammed into this antebellum city. But recovery from the worst disaster to befall <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in a century will be a long time coming as people rebuild splintered homes, shattered dreams and a reeling economy. `` There are a lot of emotional scars out there that will take a long time healing,'' Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said last week. `` Everybody would like to have things just like they were and that's not going to be.'' Progress has been made since the storm came ashore in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> on Sept. 21, killing 18 across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and leaving 65,000 homeless, 1 million in the dark, 270,000 jobless and $ 4 billion in damage. Schools have reopened and power has been restored. Roads have been cleared and the swing bridge linking the mainland and barrier islands northeast of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> is back in place. Armed National Guardsmen who patrolled once-shattered streets and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops who helped clear debris are long gone. Restaurants and hotels have reopened, but business is slow. `` Normally October and April are our busiest months of the year. Hopefully, things will be better in the spring,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, co-owner of <PERSON> Josiah </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> restaurant in downtown <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. Sixty-three buildings collapsed and hundreds of historic structures were damaged in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> where piles of debris wait to be carted from some streets. Local officials hope to have most of it cleared in two weeks. Across the <LOCATION> Cooper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>, blue plastic sheets still protect roofs torn apart by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s winds. Meanwhile, trees, siding, roofs and furnishings from oceanfront homes litter Isle of Palms. Thirty miles to the northeast, where the shrimping village of <LOCATION> McClellanville </LOCATION> bore the brunt of the storm, trawlers tossed onto land as if they were toys are being carted away for repairs. Farther up the coast, the storm cut <PERSON> Pawley </PERSON>'s Island in half. The breech has been filled, but oceanfront gaps remain where homes were washed away. Sumter, 100 miles inland, was among the hardest hit areas. Damage to utilities, homes and businesses was estimated at $ 100 million. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> estimates more than 23,000 homes were destroyed or suffered heavy damage statewide. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has distributed nearly $ 5 million for uninsured losses and temporary housing. Eighty-seven people remained in the two <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelters still open last week, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quirk </PERSON>. `` We still have a long way to go,'' she said, noting the agency is serving more than 2,000 meals a day at 23 sites around the state. Families left homeless after the hurricane flooded a low-income housing project in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> do not know what to do next. `` I do n't know where I'm going to live,'' said 78-year-old <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Furgeson </PERSON> who sought refuge in <LOCATION> Ebenezer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> A.M.E. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>. `` The only thing I wish is they could turn me out to a shelter of my own.'' Children are living in a church shelter and attending school in <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> because their homes 25 miles away in <LOCATION> McClellanville </LOCATION> were destroyed. `` I cried the first day I went to school in <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> because I miss my home, my school and everything,'' <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. Gov. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said housing is a top priority, followed by reviving the state's $ 4.7 billion tourism economy by next summer. Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has already urged visitors to return to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and officals in <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> are mounting a $ 1.6 million advertising campaign to lure vacationers. `` We need to let the world know we're OK,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pate </PERSON>, the publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` Even though we've taken a pretty hard blow, we're still in business.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s beaches, which attract upwards of 15 million visitors a year, were hit hard by the storm. Crews worked feverishly to build a sand berm to protect oceanfront structures from the highest tides in a decade last week. The water lapped harmlessly against the dunes and <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> was criticized by some for pushing the multimillion-dollar project when people remain homeless. But the governor had no apologies, saying getting the beaches back in shape is a key to jump-starting the tourism economy. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s winds snapped trees, causing an estimated $ 1 billion loss for the timber industry, enough to build a house for every family in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The farming and fishing industries also were shattered, as <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> destroyed barns, boats and packing houses. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> estimates $ 303 million in damage to crops, buildings and livestock statewide. In <LOCATION> McClellanville </LOCATION>, shrimpers face the prospect of a bleak winter before they can make repairs and get back in business. But residents promise to rebuild. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Linen </PERSON> has bad dreams about the storm when she tied her mother and two children to the porch of her home so they would n't be washed away `` I have nightmares like I'm fighting for my life again,'' she said. `` But I still say we are blessed. Material things can be replaced.''

<HEAD>Man-Made Wall Challenges Manhattan Climbers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on sports wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The handful of rock climbers who insist on pursuing their obscure sport amid the skyscrapers of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> have decided to do something about the acute shortage of cliffs: They've built an indoor climbing wall Clambering across a plywood crag may lack the visceral thrills of scaling a 300-foot cliff in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or a soaring spire in the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>. But the fake wall that opened Oct. 12 offers climbers a chance to practice most of the basic rock moves. And more important, it's close to home. `` It's great,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaz </PERSON>, one of about 60 climbers who turned out for opening festivities. `` This is a perfect time for it to open, because it's starting to get nippy outside.'' The wall, in a little-used city recreation center on West 59th Sreet not far from the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Performing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, occupies one end of an old paddleball court. Sheets of three-quarter inch plywood are bolted to the 20-foot-high wall in replicas of the shapes climbers seek in nature: an overhanging cliff face; a narrow chimney; knife-edged arete, or buttress; a two-foot roof jutting out horizontally. Bolted to the wall are knobby holds cast of sand and plastic resin in a variety of shapes, from easily grasped `` buckets'' to pockets just big enough to grasp with one finger, to narrow, sloping edges that offer minimum purchase for fingertips or toes. Protected by safety ropes, climbers puzzle out routes to the top, or move delicately from one side of the wall to the other in that vertical ballet mountaineers call traversing. Installing the wall was more a political feat than a technical one. About 18 months ago, climbers who keep their skills sharp by working out on boulders in Central Park found the rangers seemed to be making a special effort to chase them away. Normally a disorganized lot, they formed a loose alliance called the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climbers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to lobby parks officials to call off the troops. Organizer <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Erenzo </PERSON> says he was pleasantly surprised to find city officials receptive to the new club's overtures. They quickly agreed to call off the rangers if the climbers would agree to avoid a few well-traveled spots. Then, when the climbers mentioned they were worried about twisting their ankles on rocks sticking out of the ground at the base of their favorite 20-foot cliff, `` Rat Rock,'' the city sent in a backhoe to clear the ground and laid in a layer of shock-absorbing wood chips. `` The club gave us credibility,'' said <PERSON> Erenzo </PERSON>, 38, who has a business designing and building exhibits for trade shows. `` It showed them we were n't a bunch of yahoos.'' It turned out <PERSON> Erenzo </PERSON>'s contact in the parks hierarchy was eager to encourage off-beat sports. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant commissioner for recreation, already had helped organize Frisbee championships, skateboard contests and BMX bicycle exhibitions. And <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> had dabbled with climbing in an Outward Bound-style confidence-building program the city offers for teen-agers. `` There's a thrill from it that I do n't think you get in many organized sports _ you're challenging yourself and seeing what you're made of,'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said. `` It's a real test of the individual.'' When <PERSON> Erenzo </PERSON> started talking about artificial walls, the city's biggest worry was the risk of someone falling and filing a lawsuit In several months of lobbying, <PERSON> Erenzo </PERSON> showed <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> that artificial climbing walls are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and are slowly coming to this country. The best known is at Snowbird, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where a huge fiberglass scarp was the site of the International Sport Climbing Championships in August. <PERSON> Erenzo </PERSON>, who has been climbing for a decade and helped judge the Snowbird contest, worked to convince city officials his sport is safe if pursued responsibly. The climbers demonstrated how they hang a rope from the top of a practice cliff, so a partner can catch a climber who slips from the rock within a foot or two. After a slide show by leading French wall designer <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanche </PERSON>, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> decided to give the idea a try, and offered the skylit paddleball court in the underused recreation center. Everyone involved realizes the wall is n't accident-proof, but they've developed a system to lessen the legal risk. Climbers must sign a form releasing the city from liability and pay a nominal sign-up fee; they must supply their own ropes and gear; they must follow safety rules that will be enforced by a parks employee. City carpenters built the wall at an estimated cost of $ 4,000. The climbers club raised $ 500 and the American Alpine club chipped in $ 500 for the resin-cast holds, which are produced commercially by several small companies. Even as the first climbers tested the feel of the new wall, club members and officials were talking about expanding the effort. If the wall proves popular, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said others may go up in one or two other spots around the city. And the permits climbers sign to use the wall will also entitle them to hassle-free climbing at selected rock outcroppings in city parks _ as long as they display the permit on their `` posterior aspect.''

 The children have returned to school and a paper Halloween pumpkin hangs at the door, but fitful sleep, sudden anger and friends on food stamps keep Hurricane Hugo on the minds of <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Troughton </PERSON>. `` The aftermath, to me, has been worse than the hurricane,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Troughton </PERSON> said in an interview last week, a month after the deadly storm slammed into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` The confusion, the sadness and just watching people you know with everything destroyed, to me, is the worst part.'' <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> left some 50,000 people homeless, 18 dead and at least $ 4 billion damage in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> when it struck Sept 21. By the time the hurricane faded away in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, 29 people on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland and some 56 in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> were dead. Like thousands of others, the Troughtons are trying to cope with the aftermath of the most expensive hurricane in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. The roof of their home must be replaced and the interior repainted to hide water damage. `` Frankly, we feel very guilty because we've had it really so very easy compared to everybody else,'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Troughton </PERSON> said. The night the hurricane came ashore with 135 mph winds, the Troughtons and their three children huddled in their split-level, wood-frame home across the harbor from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. The family had waited too late to leave for an emergency shelter, a decision <PERSON> Troughton </PERSON> says he has only recently fully considered. `` I feel like I took my children's and my wife's lives in jeopardy by staying here and I would never, ever do that again,'' he said. `` I was more scared the night of the hurricane than I ever was,'' he added. `` I had my three children lying on a mattress on the kitchen floor because I felt that was the safest place in the house. And <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> and I sat there staring at each other for four hours.'' Because downed power lines and other dangerous debris littered the streets after the storm, the Troughtons sent <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, 11, and <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON>, 3, to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to stay with relatives. Fifteen-year-old <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a sophomore and football player at <ORGANIZATION> Wando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, stayed behind to help remove fallen trees. `` We paid the <LOCATION> Wando </LOCATION> offensive and defensive line to come over and haul off the debris from the front yard,'' said <PERSON> Troughton </PERSON>, who returned to his job at a rental car agency within a week. At first, the Troughtons and their neighbors cooked on gas grills outside and spent most of their time in their gargages, which were cooler than their homes with the air conditioning out. <PERSON> Troughton </PERSON> says normalcy began to return when electricity was restored after nine days and the children came home from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Then came <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s friends _ six or seven a night for three nights _ staying while their own families tried to find replacements for their destroyed homes. Though generators no longer roar outside powerless homes, Mrs. <PERSON> Troughton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> say sleep is still difficult for them. `` You've got so much adrenaline flowing,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said, `` you're scared it might happen again. His football games and <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>'s soccer games restarted, adding to the sense of normalcy, but with a twist. Spectators were `` frustrated and tired and angry, and they would let the referee just have it,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Troughton </PERSON>. She tried to explain contradictory emotions: `` You know that there's tragedy and you're real, real sorry. But there's that selfishness inside, that ` I've got enough problems of my own.''' She described being in the grocery checkout line, though, shortly after <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> and having an acquaintance turn to her: `` She said, ` Have you ever used food stamps? I'm so ashamed.' It's people like that that you really do feel sorry for, because it's not only that they need it, their pride is hurt.''

 For some <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands it will take years to recover fully from Hurricane Hugo, but most are quickly bouncing back and starting to rebuild, business analysts and government officials say. `` I think initially we had thought it was going to be much worse than it's turning out to be,'' said <PERSON> Dorla </PERSON> <PERSON> Humes </PERSON>, a senior economist for the Barbados-based <ORGANIZATION> Caribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which is assessing damage on <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> and the twin island states of <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Barbuda </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kitts-Nevis </ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless, Ms. <PERSON> Humes </PERSON> and others said the widespread destruction of homes, buildings, hotels, roads and utilities would set back the economies of the small eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island nations, which have grown rapidly in recent years on the strength of a buoyant tourism industry. `` Certainly for the rest of this year, and perhaps well into next year, there is going to be a slowdown in economic activity in most of the islands affected by the hurricane,'' she said. Hurricane Hugo buffeted a dozen islands along a 500-mile arc from <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> on a two-day sweep of the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, Sept. 16-17, before slamming into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast. The storm, which carried winds of 140 mph and heavy rain, killed an estimated 56 people in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and 29 on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland, left thousands homeless and caused billions of dollars in damage. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, about 1,000 military police are still on duty and a nighttime curfew remains in effect even though there have been no disturbances since hundreds of residents went on a four-day looting spree during and after the hurricane. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, about 70 miles east of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, was by far the hardest hit of the three main islands of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory. Federal officials said 6,300 homes in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, or one-third of the total, were heavily damaged or destroyed. Power, water and telephone service still have not been fully restored, and dozens of plundered stores stand vacant. The territorial government has estimated damage on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> and the two other main islands, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION>, at $ 500 million. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> said he thought it would take at least two years for <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> to fully recover. Similarly, <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, a British colony of 12,500 inhabitants about 200 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, was all but flattened by the hurricane. Ten people were killed and one-fourth of the population was left homeless. `` You're talking about a rewrite of that country,'' said <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a regional coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Caribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>. `` You're going to have basically a different country in five years.'' The French island of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, with a population of 340,000, also was extensively damaged and 15,000 people were left homeless. Hundreds of conscript French soldiers are helping repair downed utility poles, but as of last week, 40 percent of the island remained without power and 40 percent without telephones. Elsewhere, however, power, water and communications have been restored and reconstruction is well under way, officials say. In <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, easily the most economically advanced, and with 3.3 million inhabitants, most populous of the islands struck by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, life has virtually returned to normal except for the extreme east and the two small offshore islands of <LOCATION> Culebra </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s largest bank, estimated total damage at $ 1.1 billion dollars, including lost production. Chief economist <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> said economic growth would probably constrict this year from a projected 3.4 percent to 3.1 percent. But he said recovery is occurring so quickly the economy should be back to normal by the third quarter of next year. `` Right now, the economy is recovering very, very fast, especially in the eastern quarter where most of the manufacturing is located,'' <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> said. `` We had expected the blow to be more severe.'' He said <PERSON> Puerto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> could expect a `` mini-boom'' in construction as the island rebuilds with millions of dollars in insurance and federal disaster assistance filtering through the economy. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has allocated $ 1.1 billion in disaster assistance for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>' Economic Secretariat, based in <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> was the most destructive hurricane to hit the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> since the 1920s. In the four <ORGANIZATION> OECS </ORGANIZATION> countries affected _ <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kitts-Nevis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Barbuda </LOCATION> _ the hurricane demolished 800 to 1,000 low-income houses and three hospitals and heavily damaged roads and electrical, water and telephone systems. <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>, the southernmost of the islands affected, escaped serious property damage, but lost 80 percent of its banana crop, the impoverished country's main export and foreign-exchange earner, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. Substantial damage to citrus crops, livestock, poultry and the fishing industry also occurred throughout the region. But <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said that in most of the islands `` the emergency-relief phase is virtually over. The help we will be looking for will be for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the economies.'' The priority now is getting hotels back in shape in time for the winter tourist season starting in December, he said. `` Fortunately, with the exception of <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, tourism has not been that badly affected by the hurricane,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` Tourism is one of the industries that can rebound most quickly.''

<HEAD>USDA Study Says Boll Weevil Program Profitable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The new use of old farming practices is enjoying immense popularity as `` alternative'' agricultural methods edge further into the limelight. Do n't forget the boll weevil when these new-fangled farming methods are brought up. That legendary cotton pest might be an example of how the good guys can win if old habits are broken and new methods adopted. But first, a little background. Called by a number of names _ low input sustainable agriculture, or <ORGANIZATION> LISA </ORGANIZATION>, is one _ the concept of alternative agriculture is attractive to many farmers because it involves cutting production costs. And that can produce larger profits. By whatever name, advocates have been urging alternative agriculture for years, some wanting to promote the cause of `` organic'' foods, others seeking to improve the environment, still others who believe farm production costs are far too high. Advocates got a big lift from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in its Sept. 7 `` Alternative Agriculture'' report. One major recommendation was that federal farm programs should be changed to encourage the use of less chemicals and to help farmers get back to the old system of crop rotations and other sound conservation practices. `` Well-managed alternative farming systems nearly always use less synthetic chemical pesticides, fertilizers and antibiotics per unit of production than comparable conventional farms,'' the report said. `` Reduced use of these inputs lowers production costs and lessens agriculture's potential for adverse environmental and health effects without necessarily decreasing _ and in some cases increasing _ per acre crop yields and the productivity of livestock management systems.'' Now, about the <PERSON> boll </PERSON> <PERSON> weevil </PERSON>'s contribution to the environment and agricultural profitability. The boll weevil for generations of cotton farmers has been one of the dire threats to livelihood. By the late 1920s, the weevil had spread to the entire Cotton Belt, from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> historians, the entire economy of the South was affected. Farmers, bankers and merchants suffered. Many went broke, farms were abandoned and tenants moved away. The era of DDT and its chemical relatives raised hopes against the boll weevil and other insect pests. But by 1955 the weevil joined other insects that had developed resistance to the chlorinated hydrocarbons such as DDT. Gradually, many of the powerful chemicals were banned or phased out in favor of more effective versions. All were increasingly expensive to use. In 1978, a small-scale cotton boll weevil eradication program began in parts of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. It was gradually expanded into all of the two states and eventually into others, including <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> recently published a study on the economic returns from the boll weevil eradication project in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> from 1978 through 1987. `` The eradication program yielded an annual rate of return of 187 percent for farmers; 97 percent when all public costs are included,'' the report said. `` Fewer applications of pesticides following eradication also benefit the environment.'' Basically, the cooperative program involved close attention to insect cycles, tillage methods and timing, targeting chemical applications properly and the use of many other factors relating to the pests and local conditions. `` The economic benefit from the eradication program flow primarily from a 69-pound gain in per acre cotton yields and an annual cost savings of about $ 30 per acre from using less pesticides,'' the report said. `` Cotton land gained $ 14 per acre in value as farmers switched from less profitable crops.'' Researchers admitted that the weevil eradication program benefited from the colder weather of the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> and that the procedures `` may be less effective in warmer areas such as <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>.'' Further, the report cautioned, `` The high rate of return and the biological success of the eradication program from the Carolinas can be extended to other regions only with extreme caution.'' Even within the two states, there were large differences. For example, pesticide savings were only $ 6.74 per acre in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> piedmont, but were $ 24.97 per acre in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> piedmont. Although the weevil study did not address the broader issue of `` alternative'' agriculture, it did highlight a few of the benefits suggested in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s report. In its call for more research money, the council's report said the priorities for an expanded program for competitive research grants should include an analysis of pest control needs. Development of new pest management strategies should be sought to `` take advantage of cultural practices'' available to farmers, crop rotations and the use of beneficial insects, parasites and diseases to control pests, it said. Other biological and genetic pest controls also should be developed. In a way, then, the long war against the boll weevil may be a model for other efforts. At least it worked in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Jaguar Hopes To Make Less Expensive Car in GM Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British luxury automaker, is looking to produce a less expensive model appealing to business executives if plans for cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> go through, a <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> executive said. `` An association with a large company like <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> would enable us to look at the possibility of introducing a smaller <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, an area in which as a small independent company we can not consider as the investment and components-cost would be too high,'' <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boole </PERSON> said Thursday. `` We want to look at other market opportunities and one of those is a downsized model in the $ 30,000 to $ 35,000 range,'' <PERSON> Boole </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home near the <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> plant at Coventry in the <LOCATION> English </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION>. `` Because we are small we are somewhat constrained in what we can do,'' <PERSON> Boole </PERSON> added. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> cars are known for their sleek lines and high-quality interior trim. The highest-priced model costs around $ 64,000. Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday at the opening of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Motorfair </LOCATION> he hoped within one month to present his stockholders with a plan outlining cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. The plan would thwart a merger bid by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic rival, which this week disclosed it has built a stake of 10.4 percent in <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> is set against a merger that would undermine his rule over one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most famous companies. He told reporters that negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, the world's biggest automaker, could lead to <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> receiving a huge cash injection and guarantee his company's independence. British auto industry reporters said <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> would probably propose to its stockholders that <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> sell <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> a 15 percent stake in the company in return for about $ 237 million cash. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> currently produces 50,000 cars a year and <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> deal would enable <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> to invest immediately in new models and cut spending on components by as much as $ 950 million a year. `` <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has been a supplier for decades of gear boxes to <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Boole </PERSON>. `` The most important thing for us in an association with <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> would be access to low-cost components and to <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s advanced research. That would mean developing our current range of cars and making them more cost effective.'' <PERSON> Boole </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> would concentrate on `` critical items'' in its cars like body style, engines and the interior trim _ `` what the customer sees and touches.'' He said the company would look to <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> for the `` not-so-critical, out-of-sight background technology'' of wiring harness, axles, backup systems and air bags _ `` the areas in which a small company like ours finds it is n't cost effective to spend time and money.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Soo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is considering an $ 82 million buyout bid from <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which already owns 56 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Soo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> stock, the two railroads announced Thursday. Canadian Pacific would pay $ 19.50 a share for all outstanding common stock under the proposal. <PERSON> Soo </PERSON> <PERSON> Line </PERSON> said a special committee of independent directors would consider the proposal. Soo Line stock closed Thursday at $ 20.25 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, up up $ 2.75 cents a share. The stock's 52-week high was $ 26.37 -LCB- and its low was $ 16.75. A buyout would be subject to the approval of shareholders representing at least two-thirds of the 9.5 million shares of outstanding Soo Line stock, <ORGANIZATION> Soo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergene </PERSON> said. Approval also is needed from the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the special independent directors' committee and Soo Line's overall board of directors, which is controlled by Canadian <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. `` I guess you would have to characterize it as friendly,'' <PERSON> Bergene </PERSON> said the buyout bid. `` Our relationship with CP has been a close one for many years.'' Montreal-based Canadian <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> has controlled more than 50 percent of Soo Line stock since 1961. Soo Line acquired the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. Minneapolis-based Soo Line, the 10th largest rail system in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, operates freight lines in 12 midwestern states. 1988 was Soo Line's first profitable year since 1984. The railroad had net income of $ 15.6 million, or $ 1.64 a share, compared with a loss of $ 8.5 million, or a loss of 90 cents a share, in 1987. But in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the results of which were announced Thursday, Soo Line had a net loss of $ 1.5 million, or 16 cents a share. That compares with a profit for the same period last year of $ 2.9 million, or 31 cents a share. For the first nine months of 1989, the railroad lost $ 398,000, or 4 cents a share, the company said. Canadian Pacific, which earned $ 820.1 million in fiscal 1988 on revenues of $ 12 billion, is a diversified company with holdings in transportation, waste services, energy, forest products, real estate and hotels, and telecommunications and manufacturing. <PERSON> Graeme </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurray </PERSON>, a Canadian <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, said the proposed buyout `` is the best way to rationalize the relationship between CP and the Soo and maintain the viability of the Soo Line.''

<HEAD>Union Pacific, Burlington Northern Report 3rd-Quarter Profit Declines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 17 percent drop in third-quarter profit Thursday, blaming the lower income primarily on refinery operations the company has sold. <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> also reported a decline in profit, due mostly to income lost from operations that have been spun off to shareholders. Discounting the refinery costs, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s profits dropped 2 percent, reflecting a softening in the economy, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> said third-quarter earnings totaled $ 137.4 million, or $ 1.35 per share, on revenues of $ 1.58 billion. For the same period last year, the company earned $ 165 million, or $ 1.44 per share, on revenues of $ 1.54 billion. The refinery operations that have been sold earned $ 24.9 million in the third quarter of 1988. Subtracting that income, third-quarter 1988 earnings were $ 140.1 million, or $ 1.23 per share. In May, the <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, Pa.-based company bought about 11,017 shares from stockholders, softening the drop in earnings per share. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s nine-month earnings totaled $ 427.7 million, or $ 3.98 per share, on revenues of $ 4.6 billion. For the same period last year, net income was $ 456.4 million, or $ 4 per share, on revenues of $ 4.9 billion. The adjusted 1988 figures were $ 402.7 million in profit or $ 3.53 per share. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, Texas-based <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> reported a third-quarter profit of $ 72.9 million, or 95 cents a share, compared with $ 120.4 million, or $ 1.60 per share, in 1988's third quarter. Discounting the company's natural resources division, which was spun off to shareholders at the end of last year, <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 66.3 million, or 89 cents per share, in 1988's third quarter Severe weather, longer hauls and competition contributed to the earnings decline, the company said. Adding to the net income were lower interest rates and a pre-tax gain of $ 14.9 million on the sale of a partial interest in <ORGANIZATION> Trailer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Train </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern said.

<TEXT>
 Options dealers from the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> may have been suffering from a bit of jet lag, but they managed to trade contracts at makeshift posts built with lightening speed at exchanges in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It went real smooth,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, one of roughly 150 traders and support staffers who were shuttled by chartered jet to exchanges farther East following the Bay Quake that knocked out power at their own market in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` Customers could reach us, we could get -LRB- trades -RRB- out, though not as timely as if we were on our own exchange,'' said <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, who was working at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. At the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Moulds </PERSON> said there were `` no hitches. Once they got oriented, it was an easy do.'' Volume was lighter than the usual 70,000 contracts, but traders said they expect activity to pick up as they become more familiar with their surroundings and also because of today's expiration of October stock options. Today is the deadline for investors to renegotiate the options, which enable them to buy or or sell specific stocks at a specific price at a certain time. The <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> exchange trades options _ which many investors use to hedge their stock positions _ in 130 underlying stocks. Among big-name stocks that have options traded only on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> exchange are <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> exchange was able to continue stock trading by rerouting orders through the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> exchange. But because the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> exchange does n't trade options, officials took the unprecedented step of relocating the options operation. Plans to transport Pacific options trading began forming shortly after the earthquake hit late Tuesday afternoon local time, knocking out the electricity. From then on it was an around-the-clock effort involving a multitude of phone calls among exchange officials and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which sanctioned the plan Wednesday. At the American and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stock exchanges, carpenters and electricians worked through the night erecting trading areas for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> traders. At the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, computer experts labored marathon-style laying extra cables and programming exchange computers to accept new issues. The American exchange, like the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, handled hotel accommodations for traders assigned there. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> dealers arrived early enough to begin trading at the market's 8:30 a.m. CDT opening, maps were handed out to help them negotiate their way around the 50,000-square-foot trading floor of the exchange. But in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, extra time was needed for the traders to arrive and get settled and trading did not begin until 1 p.m. EDT. Trading was to begin at the normal morning hour today. Most of the traders were in good spirits, though <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said a house belonging to one of them had collapsed in the disastrous quake. `` Exhausted? That's an understatement,'' said <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> after trading closed Thursday. Exchange officials were no better rested after market events beginning last Friday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 109.58 points _ a drop exceeded only by the Black Monday crash of 1987 _ panicking financial markets around the world. `` It's been a bad week,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kender </PERSON>, executive vice president of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which processes all options trades. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, building inspectors cleared the exchange's trading floors Thursday, but spokesman <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said options traders would remain where they were through today Normal trading was expected to resume Monday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Group Says Common Practices Not in Consumers' Interest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The next time you write your phone number on a credit card receipt or obligingly hand over a credit card when paying by check, think twice, a consumer group says. The organization, <ORGANIZATION> Bankcard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, says these common practices of stores and restaurants may lead to fraud and invasion of privacy. `` Store clerks often pressure consumers into writing their bankcard numbers on personal checks, but these consumers do n't realize the potential danger in doing so,'' the group's director, <PERSON> Elgie </PERSON> <PERSON> Holstein </PERSON>, said at a news conference Thursday He contended that `` mail order fraud and application fraud are increasingly popular crimes, and placing this information -LRB- a card's number and expiration date -RRB- on a personal check enables a thief to make purchases or apply for credit in the customer's name. `` Requiring customers to present a major credit card as identification, or even noting on the check that the consumer holds a Visa or <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION>, can be an appropriate merchant practice,'' <PERSON> Holstein </PERSON> said. `` It is dangerous, however, to require credit card numbers to be written on checks.'' To help consumers deal with this practice, the organization is making available a wallet-sized `` Consumer Action Card'' to present to merchants who insist on writing credit card numbers on personal checks. The wallet card alerts merchants that recording this information encourages fraud and may violate a customer's privacy. The bank card-holders group also is concerned that merchants frequently require consumers to write their phone numbers on credit card sales slips when processing bank credit card transactions. <PERSON> Holstein </PERSON> said this is a violation of consumers' privacy rights. Also, he said that under Visa and <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION> operating rules, merchants can not refuse a customer's sale just because he or she refuses to provide personal information on a bankcard sales slip. `` Merchants do not need a credit card customer's phone number since a merchant who correctly processes a bankcard transaction is relieved of further financial liability by the cardholder's bank,'' <PERSON> Holstein </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Bankcard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> describes itself as a national non-profit consumer education organization. A brochure containing the wallet-sized `` Consumer Action Card'' is available for $ 1.00 from <ORGANIZATION> BHA </ORGANIZATION>, 460 Spring Park Place, Suite 1000, <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON>, Va, 22070. By coincidence, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> chain of specialty apparel stores announced later Thursday that its stores would no longer write credit card numbers on personal checks used for purchases and would no longer require a customer's phone number on credit card sales slips. But <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietzel </PERSON>, a Limited spokesman, said the company was not motivated by concerns about fraud. He said the company is simply hoping to serve customers more efficiently. He said the same-day timing of the announcement was not intentional.

<TEXT>
 A year ago this week, Ambassador <PERSON> Yuriy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> led a toast at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> _ with Soviet champagne _ to a new joint venture between American investors and his government. The idea was to capitalize, in the full sense of the word, on <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign of perestroika, or economic restructuring, by introducing Russian products such as that champagne and beer to American consumers. A year later, importer <ORGANIZATION> Torg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, as the company was named, has little to show for itself except difficulties here and the pitfalls of perestroika. Its Englewood Cliffs office closed because of `` internal problems'' with employees, said company president Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, a Florida-based millionaire entrepreneur with a medical degree. <PERSON> Torg </PERSON> now has a new office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Backer <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiat </PERSON> of the advertising agency Chiat-Day-Mojo pulled out in May, citing frustration with progress in importing goods. The public relations firm hired to promote Torg, Chiat-Day-Mojo-owned <ORGANIZATION> Jessica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was dropped because there was little for it to do, said <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>. Now, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> and Soviet emigre Lev Model work alone with help from consultants. Together they own 51 percent of <LOCATION> Torg </LOCATION>, one of the first joint ventures between a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in this country, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. He would not disclose their investment so far. Adding to their difficulties are problems connected with the Soviet apparatus providing the goods. `` I think we were somewhat premature in blowing our horn,'' said <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, speaking in an interview from his Winter Haven, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, home. `` It was perhaps unrealistic of us to think of things getting here sooner,'' he said. May had been the target date for the venture's mineral water soft drinks to be introduced, to be followed by a Soviet beer called Zhiguli. But <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> has not given up, and said <LOCATION> Torg </LOCATION> _ the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> word for trade _ will become active soon. A national distributor has been signed up to handle Zhiguli, pronounced zee-GUH-lee, and should be bringing the brew to market by year's end, said <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>. He would not identify the distributor. Discussions are continuing with distributors for Soviet champagne, wine and soft drinks made from mineral water in the nation's <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> region, he said. `` In the great scheme of life, I do n't think we're way behind.'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said <PERSON> Torg </PERSON>'s efforts have lately centered mainly on showing products to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distributors. Difficulty in obtaining samples is just one of the obstacles in <LOCATION> Torg </LOCATION>'s way. He said the Soviets are not used to shipping small quantities. Goods are also backed up at shipping points in that nation. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brougher </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expert on Soviet trade, said lack of cooperation among Soviet ministries unused to the joint venture idea may also be holding things up. `` Perestroika involves decentralization of the entire foreign trade machinery,'' added <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` It takes time for the system to adjust to change. Frankly, I think they are doing remarkably well.'' When <PERSON> Torg </PERSON>'s formation was announced, there were 110 to 115 joint ventures with foreign companies in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. About a dozen involved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests. Now, says <PERSON> Brougher </PERSON>, Americans are involved in 90 of about 1,000 registered joint ventures, about 100 of which are active. Of the American joint venturers, the 40-year-old <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>'s background may make him standout Born in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> of Soviet emigre parents, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> learned Russian so he could speak to his grandmother. He owns a weight-loss franchise operation based in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and his previous holdings included a surgical center and medical laboratory. `` He seems very suave and sophisticated,'' said someone formerly involved in <LOCATION> Torg </LOCATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` He's the kind of person who exudes a lot of charisma.'' Model has imported small amounts of Soviet products for Russian communities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for nearly two decades. He and <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> met through mutual friends.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that five national title insurance companies illegally fixed title search fees in six states. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> found Thursday that the title companies set prices for title search and examination services by participating in a rating bureau that pooled data on their policies and claims. The agency ordered them to set future rates independently in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> had issued a complaint against the companies in 1985.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed In Listless European Trading, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was mixed in listless European trading at midmorning today. Gold prices were lower in dull dealings. Foreign exchange dealers predicted a quiet day for the dollar in the absence of new economic indicators and after recent volatility on currency and stock markets. `` Technically, the dollar is looking overbought,'' one analyst in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> said. `` We'll probably see some corrective action in that as people reposition themselves before the weekend.'' A <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> trader said, `` There's very little upside potential,'' a sentiment echoed by a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> dealer who said, `` The general sentiment is still bearish.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar closed at 141.35 yen, down 0.20 yen from Thursday's close of 141.55 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at a higher rate of 141.76 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.8460 West German marks, down from 1.8525; 1.6180 Swiss francs, down from 1.6225; 6.2702 French francs, down from 6.2875; 2.0833 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0820; 1,359.25 Italian lire, up from 1,358.50; 1.1742 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1741 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.5930 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.5940 late Thursday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 366.90 a troy ounce, down from late Thursday's $ 367.75. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a later recommended price of $ 366.70 dollars. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 367, down from $ 368.20 late Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.49 to close at a bid $ 367.40. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 5.09 a troy ounce, unchanged from late Thursday.

 Prices continued to climb on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> today, while the dollar slipped against the Japanese yen. The dollar closed at 141.35 yen, down 0.20 yen from Thursday's close of 141.55 yen It opened the day higher at 141.93 yen and then ranged between 141.35 and 142.05 yen. On the stock market, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> rose 112.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 35,486.38. It was the index's fourth consecutive gain since Monday's plunge of 647.33 points, the year's largest single drop Dealers said orders from small-lot buyers, relieved at gains overnight on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, streamed in continuously during the day. The Nikkei index, which rose to 35,611.38 soon after trading began, lost part of its early gains toward the end of the session due to profit taking, dealers said. Although the trading mood was positive throughout the day, `` Investors, especially dealers, do n't want to hold a strong position over the weekend,'' said a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Dai-Ichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Dealers said the index has bounced back steadily since Monday as stability in the foreign exchange market and on Wall Street have renewed investor confidence in the stock market. The dollar in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> fell earlier due to a smaller-than-expected increase in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer price index released Thursday but recovered later as the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 major issues rose, traders said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reported the nation's seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index rose by 0.2 percentage point in September. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market had expected a 0.4-0 .5 percentage point rise, which discouraged dollar buying, a trader with a major Japanese commercial bank said `` At the same time, however, other market players reassured by the steady recovery in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stock market are inclined to buy the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The dollar is likely to get weaker in the long run considering the current slowdown in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy,'' the trader added. Dealers said a number of large Japanese institutional investors were still purchasing dollars, but selling by exporters and speculators was holding down the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Also on Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> began option trading in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Stock Price Index for futures issues, in which shareholders can take market action with a fixed quantity of a security, or at a fixed price within a specified time to avoid risks in spot trading.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said today it does not plan to join a proposed buyout of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a deal in which it had been a major backer. A group of managers and employees of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> _ the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> _ has been trying to revise its original $ 6.75 billion offer for the carrier after the group failed to line up financing for the deal. The group's announcement last Friday that it could not reach agreement with banks to finance the buyout was a factor in Wall Street's Friday the 13th plunge, in which the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 190 points. British Airways, in a brief statement today, said it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> in the foreseeable future.''

<HEAD>Qintex Entertainment Files for Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an affiliate of the Australian firm facing a $ 50 million lawsuit related to its failed attempt to buy <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, today said it has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. The company also sought Chapter 11 protection Thursday for two of its subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION> Hal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company announced in a news release this morning. Company spokesman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Saks </PERSON>, reached at home by telephone, said the bankruptcy filing was unrelated to <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s failed $ 1.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> acquisition, blaming it instead on the collapse of a separate <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> $ 5.9 million loan deal `` <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> was not a party to the merger with <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> and it was not named in the subsequent lawsuit,'' he said. The company also announced that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> had resigned as president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, but said he would continue as a full-time consultant until a successor is selected. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> terminated the $ 1.5 billion acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION>, which holds 43 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, earlier this month after the company failed to provide <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> with a required $ 50 million letter of credit. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> for alleged breach of contract and fraud, seeking $ 50 million in damages. The lawsuit was pending in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> were working with a lender to secure more than $ 5.9 million needed for a distribution agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Hal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> said. But the lender, which <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> refused to identify, declined to provide the funds, prompting the bankruptcy filing in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> said. The $ 5,945,000 loan was for `` a guarantee payment against <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>'s share of a distribution agreement with <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> <PERSON> Studios </PERSON>,'' the spokesman said `` It was a long-standing agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Hal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>'' established before the <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> acquisition failed, he said, declining to elaborate further on the deal. At a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>'s Board of Directors on Oct. 18, the bankruptcy petition was authorized to offset the loss of corporate assets, to protect company shareholders and to deal with creditor's claims, the company said in a prepared statement. The company also announced that <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmel </PERSON>, an independent director of <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>'s nine-member board, had resigned because he was no longer needed due to the failure of the <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> acquisition. Officials said the company will continue to operate during Chapter 11 proceedings. Under Chapter 11, companies are protected from creditors while they work out financial difficulties.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock prices dipped Friday in thin, featureless trading. Sentiment was dented by early weakness in the pound against the West German mark, and fears that Wall Street might open lower after its strong gains Thursday. The key corporate news of the morning session was that <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> has decided to withdraw from a management-led bid for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 6.5 points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,182.8 points at midday. Volume came to a light 206.9 million shares, compared with 222 million shares at the same time Thursday. `` The market's just dawdling at the moment,'' one <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer said. `` There are no inspirational factors to buoy it higher.'' In the absence of bullish factors, traders refocused on sterling. `` The currency's early weakness washed through to the equity market,'' a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trader said.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have agreed to extend Japanese steel export restrictions for 30 more months, the government announced Friday. Under the revised U.S.-Japan pact, Japanese steel exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not exceed 5 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> annual steel consumption during the next 15 months, <PERSON> Michinao </PERSON> <PERSON> Takahashi </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. During the second 15-month period beginning in January 1991, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s quota will be 5.3 percent of annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption, <PERSON> Takahashi </PERSON> told a news conference. The previous agreement gave <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> a 5.8 percent quota out of the 18.4 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel market set aside for foreign steel producers, but <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> actually exported only 4.2 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption last year, according to Japanese figures. The earlier agreement, which expired Sept. 30, was negotiated in 1984 to give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steelmakers breathing space from foreign competition and allow them to modernize. The new agreement prohibits <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from providing any government aid to steelmakers for production, export or research, <PERSON> Takahashi </PERSON> said. The agreement comes after several rounds of protracted bilateral negotiations held in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In a short statement, <PERSON> Hikaru </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, the international trade and industry minister, described the accord as a `` real answer'' to the current problems facing steel trade between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would `` continue to make efforts to encourage the two countries' cooperation and prosperity, while working toward the healthy development of the world's steel trade ... We strongly hope that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry also will make further efforts to make structural changes and modernize.'' Friday's agreement follows a statement by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in July that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was willing to negotiate a 30-month extension of its general voluntary restraint agreement on steel with its trading partners. In a statement released after the government announcement, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Iron and <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Saito </PERSON> said, `` Despite a decrease in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s quota, we think the agreement is acceptable, considering that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is not treated unfairly compared to other countries, including the 12-member European Economic Community.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s share in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market tumbled from 8 percent to 5.6 percent. In a related development Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s fifth-largest steel maker, announced plans to set up a second steel factory with <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel company, in a 50-50 equity partnership The agreement is expected to be finalized by year's end, it said. <PERSON> Kobe </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Yukinobu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasuda </PERSON> said the joint factory will produce hot-dipped galvanized steel sheet somewhere in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, primarily to supply automakers.

 The stock market was mixed today, pausing after its rally over the past four sessions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed 113.94 points in the last four trading days, rose another 1.43 to 2,684.63 in the first half hour today.

 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s longstanding commitment to put more meat on family tables is the compelling reason behind the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s huge orders of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, says one of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top Kremlin watchers. `` The No. 1 factor is that the Soviets need to increase the output of livestock products. That is, meat. They ca n't do it alone, they've got to import -LRB- feed grains -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Then, it's the other factors that determine where they're going to import it from.'' During the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bought a record 21.7 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain with an estimated value of almost $ 3 billion. That included a record 16.3 million tons of corn and about 5.4 million tons of wheat. Since Oct. 1, the Soviets have bought more than 5 million tons of corn, including 1.2 million tons announced Thursday, plus some soybeans and soybean meal. Foster lists four `` other factors'' that also are influencing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s decision to buy grain from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. These include a reduced Soviet harvest of `` coarse'' grains such as corn and barley in 1988, along with smaller forage crops. Also, world supplies of coarse grains were tight because of last year's drought, and prices favored corn over wheat and barley <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> also cites `` improved political ties'' between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said Thursday in a telephone interview that the improved political climate ranks `` quite small relative to the other factors'' that led <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to buy so much <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain. Economics is important, too, he said. But the Soviets opted for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, with prices competitive with barley from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. Additionally, in the 1989 fiscal year, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> bought a significant amount of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain sorghum for the time, another important livestock feed grain. Overall, he said, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the total coarse grain market rose to about 70 percent last fiscal year from around 50 percent in 1988. Mostly, that was at the expense of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, which is geographically much closer to the huge Soviet market. `` If they're buying grain, economically there must be more reasons -LRB- than price -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. `` You would think the -LRB- EEC -RRB- would be cheaper because of logistics.'' Many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export advocates, including recent secretaries of agriculture, have touted the giant output potential of the American grain farmer and the reliability of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a supplier. The experts have noted for years that the longstanding commitment by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> leaders to boost the livestock sector has been the underlying reason for importing grain to make up harvest shortfalls. `` It always was a high priority,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. `` But it's at its highest priority ever right now, I would say. Because <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, to maintain support _ and the opposition is there _ needs to show some immediate, short-term improvement ... in consumption patterns, meat products and so forth.'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has had so many problems with consumer goods and food products that `` he just has to regain support if his reform program is going to make it anywhere.'' On the matter of world trade, Foster thinks <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` without a doubt'' would like to be part of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and is currently extending a few feelers. Before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Soviet leaders thought `` the whole thing was an imperialist whatever,'' he said. `` Since then, they've made it clear that they're interested but have not pushed it really.''

 Milk prices at the farm are climbing steadily this season, and the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says that is translating into higher prices at consumer dairy counters. `` Dairy markets are tight because of strong cheese sales, non-fat dry milk exports, and weakness in milk production,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` However, the size of the price increases largely was determined by the time of events,'' the report said. `` Milk production unexpectedly collapsed at midyear, after commitments had been made for large exports of non-fat dry milk and after cheesemakers had decided to delay rebuilding of cheese stock until the flush season'' of higher milk production last spring. But analysts said milk output probably will rise above year-earlier levels in 1990 and that `` seasonal easing'' should eliminate supply problems. `` Dairy prices will drop from this autumn's highs,'' the report said. `` By next spring, prices may be below a year earlier.'' The farm price of milk in 1989 may average `` slightly more than $ 1 above'' last year's $ 12.24 per 100 pounds, the report said. In 1990, it may average below the 1988 level. `` Retail prices of milk and dairy products were slower to start rising than farm or wholesale prices. However, the increase in retail prices will be brisk during the rest of 1989,'' the report said. `` For the first time in many years, rises in retail dairy prices will surpass those of all food or all -LRB- consumer -RRB- items.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will pay <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> $ 50,000 and observe certain restrictions if it decides to do business in the state again, officials said.

<HEAD>No Quake Fissures in Huge California Muni Bond Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s municipal bond market, the nation's largest, felt barely a ripple from the earthquake last week, though some of the roads, bridges and buildings financed by the bonds sustained damage Prices of the bonds were virtually unaffected by the quake. Mutual fund operators said they received few panicky calls from investors in California-based municipal bond funds, and almost none of the investors pulled out. One reason for the complacency is that precautions for an earthquake were built into most of the bonds. Another less reassuring reason is that information about the extent of quake damage to facilities built by the bonds was sketchy. Bond experts expect few problems with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> municipal bond issuers making interest payments in the short term. However, over a longer period of time, there could be defaults when reserve funds or insurance policies designed to make short-term payments in such an emergency run out, experts said last week. `` We do n't really know the extent of all the damage that has taken place. It's not inconceivable that there could be interruptions in even some of the tax-supported debt,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guarantee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a bond insurance firm. Among the bond issues most at risk, experts said, are ones sold by small municipalities to pay for non-essential facilities, such as secondary hospitals, that may not be rebuilt if found damaged. Also at risk are bonds that financed port facilities. If any were damaged extensively, there's a chance the operators may not rebuild since there is strong competition from more modern ports in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> said. A third area of concern are the so-called tax increment districts in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. These districts were established to promote industrial development, and taxes from the new industry go to pay off bonds that were sold to build highways and other infrastructure improvements in the areas. If any of these areas were damaged by the quake, there's no guarantee the industries would rebuild, which means the revenue to pay off the bonds could drop, said <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a credit-rating agency. About 30 percent of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> municipal bonds issued so far this year carry bond insurance that guarantees interest and principal payments will be made for the life of the bond, <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> said. Of the remainder, many contain other provisions to ensure payments, such as earthquake insurance on facilities funded by the bonds, short-term work-stoppage insurance contracts, and a reserve fund equal to one year's interest payments, he said. Another protection in some issues involves the combination of several revenue sources to ensure that if one facility built by bonds is damaged, related facilities would continue providing revenue. For example, <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said, though the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> was seriously damaged by the quake, revenue from other toll bridges in the area is tied into the same revenue stream and should provide enough money to make payments on the bonds that built the bridges. But not all municipal bonds carry such protections. `` By process of deduction there probably are some bonds out there that will have some interruption of payment,'' <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said he was more concerned with the longer-term economic disruptions the quake may have caused. If residents are n't spending as much money due to highway damage, for example, local sales tax revenue could drop, lowering the ability of municipalities to make bond payments But another effect may be that sales tax revenue will jump when people start buying construction materials and other goods to rebuild, he said. Investors appeared unfazed by the quake. Though there were isolated bond issues from the quake area that declined in value last week, most <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> municipal bond prices moved with the municipal market as a whole. <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, operator of the nation's largest mutual fund composed entirely of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> municipal bonds, said it received few calls from investors concerned about the fund's fate. One reason could be that phone lines into the company's <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, headquarters were affected by the quake, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s marketing director. But he said he believed the main reason was that investors realized the diversified, $ 9 billion fund would not be affected, since it is composed of bond issues from throughout the state. Officials of <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, two other mutual fund operators, also reported few investor inquiries about their <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> muni funds.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Weaken Slightly After Soviet Corn Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower in early dealings today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as corn traders followed the old market adage, `` Buy the rumor, sell the fact.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcement late Thursday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had bought 1.2 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn confirmed rumors of a Soviet corn deal that had strongly supported the grain markets in Thursday's trading session. Thursday's speculation about the size of the sale had ranged as high as 2 million metric tons. Increased foreign demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grains and soybeans has been a key factor in this week's across-the-board gains. But the higher prices have encouraged farmers to sell more of their grain, and that was another reason for today's early decline. Forecasts for improved harvesting weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> next week also discouraged buying of futures this morning. In early trading, wheat futures were 1 \ cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.06 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at $ 2.42 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent lower across the board with December at $ 1.45 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents lower to 1 cent higher with November at $ 5.63 \ a Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in cautious trading ahead of this afternoon's quarterly <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> cattle-on-feed report. Live cattle were unchanged to .37 cent lower with October at 74.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent lower with October at 82.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .40 cent lower with October at 48.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .03 cent to .35 cent lower with February at 51.77 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings rose 49 percent in the latest quarter, mainly because of a gain from the sale of its stock in <ORGANIZATION> Adobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company said Friday. Operating income before the Adobe gain and taxes and interest rose a narrower 2 percent. Apple Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON> said the company was recovering from a squeeze on profit margins caused by high component costs. Apple was faulted for buying large quantities of computer chips at unusually high prices during a temporary shortage last year. Earnings in <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth quarter rose to $ 161.1 million, or $ 1.24 a share, including an after-tax gain of $ 48 million from the Adobe sale. That was up from $ 107.9 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 1.38 billion from $ 1.17 billion. For the full fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings rose to $ 454 million, or $ 3.53 a share, from $ 400.3 million, or $ 3.08 a share, a year earlier.

 Like the earthquake that jolted <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock market's big drop sent a tremor through the global financial system last week. The sudden plunge did n't appear to do lasting damage, but it did show Wall Street as an unstable bellwether for the world's equity markets. Its foundations look all the more creaky compared with the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock market, the world's biggest and richest. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> slipped modestly after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s plunge but quickly recovered and ended last week on its customary note _ higher. That performance is convincing many analysts that far from being a bubble about to burst, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s stock market _ like its economy _ is a bedrock of stability that's a growing influence on world markets. `` The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market, despite the fact that we've all been saying that it's overpriced and it's gone up too much, performs when the chips are down,'' said <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON>, chief investment strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the firm's asset management arm. The chips have been down in a big way twice in the past two years, and each time <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has led the world's equity markets back from the brink. Before Black Monday wiped out nearly a quarter of this country's stock market values on Oct. 19, 1987, many analysts regarded <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> as the global markets' weak link Share prices in relation to earnings were at least three times as high as in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, seemingly unsustainable heights. But <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> not only did n't trigger the crash, its decline was the smallest of any major stock market, and Japanese stocks regained their pre-crash levels months before any others. The Japanese market did it again last week as the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index erased Monday's 1.8 percent decline in just two days while other markets, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, curbed losses but remained down `` It's certainly a safer place,'' says <PERSON> Rudiger </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornbusch </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think the Japanese know better how to manage their economy and their markets. We make a culture out of financial vulnerability and volatility.'' <PERSON> Dornbusch </PERSON> blames much of Wall Street's whipsaw action on investor demands for instant returns _ buying a stock in hopes of selling it at a higher price within days or weeks, perhaps amid takeover fever, rather than looking at a company's long-term earning potential. That tendency `` really goes right to the heart of problems of American competitiveness and manufacturing performance,'' he says, especially vs. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Our horizon is lunchtime. Theirs is 10 years.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also has money on its side, says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> The cash generated by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s seemingly limitless exports of cars, stereos and computer chips gives the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market a strength that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> can not match because of the big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the potentially fragile market because we are the ones that are relying on continuous inflows of capital from abroad,'' he contends. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s buoyant economy adds an `` inherently stabilizing feature'' to the market, says <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, economist with <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> adjusted quickly to the sharp rise in the yen in 1986 and 1987 by relying more on domestic demand for growth rather than exports. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the firm's research arm forecasts <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy will grow 4.8 percent this year and 4.4 percent in 1990, compared with 2.9 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively, for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. All those economic strengths have n't enabled <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to replace <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as the leading influence on world equity markets, however. Indeed, notwithstanding <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s relatively modest decline last Monday, European markets plummeted initially and rallied only when <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> rebounded. In part, European traders ignored <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s calmer reaction because it was expected, says <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON>, international market strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Drew in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Unlike regulatory authorities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, Japanese authorities can put pressure on the country's securities firms, banks, insurance companies and pension funds to avoid a selloff. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s sky high prices also are n't seen as relevant to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where dividend income plays a bigger role in valuing stocks. Japanese shares are trading at prices that are nearly 60 times annual earnings, compared with multiples of about 13 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and 12 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. What's more, European stock markets historically have moved more closely in step with Wall Street than with <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>. All of which creates a kind of `` Mars effect'' that sets <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> apart from other financial centers, <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> says. `` The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market sets the same kind of precedent that events on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> do for everyone else.'' So <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> may not be a bellwether, but its ability to withstand the turbulence emanating from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> makes it an attractive play for investors looking to diversify, says <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON>. `` It is not like Wall Street and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' he says. `` It actually does reduce risk.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON> said that fact should help <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, which represents about 40 percent of the world's stock market by value, to garner a bigger share of global investment funds compared with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which accounts for about 33 percent of world equities. `` You'd have to say that capital is going to tend to flow towards the stable environment rather than the unstable one.''

 <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it has received commitments from three banks to provide $ 1.2 billion in financing for its $ 2.75 billion offer for a majority interest in <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. LIN has taken no position on the offer, and is already committed to a separate deal in which it plans to merge its cellular operations with those of <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the regional telephone company based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> A takeover of the New York-based LIN would extend <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s position as the largest company in the cellular telephone business <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Toronto-Dominion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which are jointly serving as agent banks on <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>'s behalf, have committed $ 1.2 billion in financing for the <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> deal, subject to customary conditions. In addition, it said the banks are highly confident that they can get commitments within the next several weeks from other foreign and domestic banks for the balance of $ 4.5 billion in financing needed for the deal. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> is trying to get more financing in place than would be needed simply to complete its $ 125 a share offer for 22 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> stock. That is because <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> has offered an additional $ 1.9 billion for a half interest in <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> cellular franchise. LIN owns the other half of the franchise and has the right to match <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s offer. On Thursday, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said it had provided clarification requested by <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s board about terms of its Oct. 10 offer for 22 million of LIN's shares. Combined with the 5.1 million LIN shares <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> already owns, acquisition of the shares would boost <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>'s stake to about 50.3 percent of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s 53.9 million shares. `` We hope that our prompt, detailed response to the issues raised by <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> will demonstrate our commitment to providing <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> shareholders with the opportunity to fully participate in the growth of the private market value of the company,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is important for shareholders of LIN to recognize that as majority owners of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>, our principal objective would be to maximize the value of all LIN shares _ those held by the public and those held by us.'' Under the offer, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said it would begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out the remaining shares at a price roughly equivalent to what a third party may have paid for all of LIN. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said that feature enables <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> shareholders to benefit from further appreciation in the value of cellular assets and receive a full private market price for their remaining shares in about five years. LIN's board earlier this week declined to take a position on the new offer from <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> and requested clarification of its terms. A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that the company had no comment as yet on the McCaw letter. In its letter, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> affirmed that <PERSON> LIN </PERSON> would have a right to pursue all corporate opportunities to acquire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cellular interests outside of McCaw interests after the deal. It also said if LIN is put up for sale in five years rather than purchased by <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> at appraised private market value, <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> will not submit a bid unless the independent directors request it, and the independent directors will run the sale process. LIN previously rejected as inadequate a <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> offer of $ 110 a share for all of its stock, and subsequently agreed on a deal with <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> to merge their cellular operations. <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> has not yet indicated what its repsonse to the new offer from <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> for LIN will be. Alluding to the deal with <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said, `` We trust that <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> will take no further actions that favor <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, but rather will conduct a fair auction of the company on a level playing field.''

<TEXT>
 The prospect of another record world cocoa crop this season points to further downward pressure on prices, which are already at their lowest in 14 years, a leading international cocoa merchant said Friday. In its first forecast for the year beginning this month, <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Duffus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> put production at 2.386 million metric tons, 231,000 tons in excess of consumption. This would be the sixth consecutive season of overproduction, lifting world stocks to a record high of 1.305 million tons and exacerbating current storage problems, the company said. `` The analysis of supply-demand fundamentals points to further downward pressure over the next 12 months,'' it added. Cocoa prices, once adjusted for inflation, are at their lowest level of the post-World War II period, severely damaging the economies of the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> and other exporting countries that rely on the export of beans for foreign exchange earnings, analysts said. Stocks are already at their highest level ever, following the estimated addition of a record 314,000 tons last season, when production rose by 198,000 tons to 2.375 million tons, according <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duffus </PERSON>'s estimates. It put the 1988-89 harvest in the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> at 810,000 tons, the biggest ever and 145,000 above 1987-88. <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>'s crop rose to 305,000 tons last season from 188,000, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s to 160,000 from 150,000 and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s to a record 65,000 from 49,000, while <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> recorded a fall to 333,000 from 342,000 and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> to 220,000 from a record 222,000 in 1987-88. The company's crop estimates for 1989-90 include the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> 730,000 tons, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> 345,000, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> 330,000, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> 255,000, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> 185,000, <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION> 110,000, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> 85,000, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> 75,000, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> 52,000, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> 45,000 and <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> 38,000 tons.

<BYLINE>British Airways Says Decision Won't Affect Its International Strategies</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision Friday to pull out of a group attempting to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> probably wo n't hurt the carrier's international marketing strategy and could be a benefit in the short-term, analysts said. The British flag carrier announced Friday it was pulling out of the group led by <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management and pilots that has been struggling to resurrect a buyout offer for the company, parent of the second largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline. The group's Oct. 13 announcement that it had failed to line up bank financing for its original $ 6.75 billion buyout plan helped spark the second-worst <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock market plunge ever. Since then, the group has been trying to get support for a revised proposal at a lower price, about $ 5.62 billion. Under the original buyout agreement, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> would have provided $ 750 million, or about three-quarters of the needed capital for the takeover, and received a 15 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. British Airways in a brief statement Friday morning said it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> in the foreseeable future.'' The company would not comment on its reasons for the decision. However, the statement noted that <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' two-year-old marketing agreement with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> would remain in effect, and there is no change in the company's strategic objectives of seeking marketing alliances and partnerships with other airlines.'' European airlines have been scrambling to link up with each other and with American and Asian airlines to form mega-carriers better equipped to compete in the increasingly global and competitive air travel industry. Analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> decision likely was a death knell for the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> buyout. But they also speculated the British carrier might participate in a future buyout plan or other hookup with another airline. `` British Airways still ultimately would like to have a greater presence in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> markets,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The analysts said they were n't surprised by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' decision The withdrawal `` would be regarded as fairly positive in the short-term,'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said. `` It's actually going to enhance their cash flow in the immediate future.'' `` Personally, I welcome it,'' said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, an airlines analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <PERSON> Laing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cruickshank </PERSON>. `` I do n't think they needed to do this deal. I think they were worried that some other European airline would take a stake. That's now less likely.'' <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> cited the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>'s recent decision to force <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to reduce its planned stake in <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> was part of an investor group that acquired <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year for $ 3.65 billion. Even though <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed holding was under the 25 percent limit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government imposes on foreign stakes in American airlines, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decided the size of <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>'s investment would give it too much influence `` I think that's why <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> feels pretty safe pulling out. They can always come back if another <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> airline steps in,'' <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said. If <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> really wanted a 15 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, it could buy it in the open market at a much cheaper price, he said. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' shares fell the equivalent of 2 cents to close at $ 3.13 a share Friday on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it has resumed negotiations with an unnamed party to buy its core financial services in an attempt to raise money to help pay off $ 1.75 billion in debt. Integrated had said Tuesday that the talks had ended. It said then that a group of its senior executives was considering making an offer. The struggling investment concern, which defaulted on debt payments in June, had been negotiating to sell key assets to raise money to pay some of its outstanding debt and avoid a bankruptcy filing. Integrated's main financial businesses are <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, its principal broker-dealer subsidiary; <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment adviser.

Negotiations for the businesses came after a $ 310 million deal with <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> fell through. <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> cited worsening conditions in the debt markets amd concerns over the value of the businesses. Integrated has not paid any principle or interest to bondholders since June, when it said it would have to default because of troubles stemming from its difficulty in diversifying out of real estate into financial services.

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed slightly lower Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting pre-weekend profit-taking after a week of substantial gains in the corn and soybean markets. Forecasts for improved harvest weather next week also put pressure on crop prices, analysts said.

<HEAD>Corporate Parent Hasbro Has High Hopes for Cabbage Patch Kids</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Cabbage Patch Kids, the cuddly dolls that once were a toy industry sensation, could be headed for a comeback thanks to a hard-sell campaign that new parent <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is aiming at customers' soft spots. `` Hasbro is going back to the basics _ the love,'' said <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, creator of the dolls that were so popular they caused near-riots in toy stores in the mid-1980s. The Cabbage Patch craze wilted when <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which formerly owned the rights to the dolls, moved away from the theme of love and caring and treated the dolls like any other toy, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, said this week. `` In the past couple of years, under all <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s stress and strain, it got away from the concept,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. Last month, two months into its contract with <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' Original Appalachian Artworks, <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> launched a $ 7 million television advertising campaign for Christmas that reintroduces the doll's original marketing concept `` It really talks about the whole adoption process and all the warm feelings,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Charness </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. A Cabbage Patch Kid comes with a birth certificate that gives the doll's name, family history, footprints and thumbprints. A mail-in adoption certificate is available if the child promises `` to love my Cabbage Patch Kid with all my heart.'' A desire to inherit the Cabbage Patch Kids was a major reason why <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest toymaker, bought some of the assets of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>, a Connecticut-based toy maker in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court proceedings. <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> had passed up a chance to buy rights to Cabbage Patch in the early 1980s only to watch the homely, stuffed dolls become an improbable megahit. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> earned wealth and renown from the dolls in the mid-1980s. But as Cabbage Patch fever died down, toy analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> became one more company to be sideswiped by the fads that periodically sweep through the industry and then fade. Analysts also said <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> relied too heavily on Cabbage Patch. Under <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>, the dolls will join such proven heavy-hitters as veteran action figure G.I. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and My Little Pony. In their heyday, Cabbage Patch dolls had $ 600 million in wholesale sales in 1985. Sales were approximately $ 60 million last year. `` For the past two years with <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s problems, there was no advertising,'' <PERSON> Charness </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> noted, `` There's a whole generation of kids 7 years old on down who do n't even know about the original concept.'' <PERSON> Charness </PERSON> would not reveal estimates but said early reports showed strong retail sales. `` I firmly belive Cabbage can be back up there,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. He said the best chances for long-term growth will come when children who grew up with the dolls become adults and buy them for their own children. <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lively </PERSON>, a toy analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Cabbage Patch wo n't be able to break its sales record because it no longer is the novelty item that had parents crowding store aisles a few years ago. The dolls sell for between $ 15 and $ 40. `` I would n't be surprised at all if it achieved $ 100 million or even $ 150 million, but $ 600 million seems like a stretch,'' she said. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 33, an artist, created the doll in 1978 as a form of soft sculpture for adults. The first dolls were modeled after real children. `` I never really considered it a toy,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who gets an undisclosed royalty under the licensing agreement. `` I intended it for adults. I saw it as a new art form.'' In 1983, he reached an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> that called for the mass-produced dolls to each have slight differences in hair, eyes, freckles and dimples. Some dolls, the Original Cabbage Patch Kids, still are hand-made by about a dozen artists at the former <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, hospital where <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> moved his studio and where he got the idea to have children adopt the dolls. The hand-made versions sell for $ 150 to $ 1,000. `` It has proven the test of time that it's a stayer,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Charness </PERSON>. `` It has proven it will be charming little boys and little girls for years to come.''

<HEAD>Travelers Loses Key Case in Appeals Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has ruled against <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, saying the Hartford-based insurer and not its policyholder should pay for legal costs associated with a pollution case. The case stems from <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION>' refusal to represent <ORGANIZATION> Avondale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state proceeding involving pollution at an <ORGANIZATION> Avondale </ORGANIZATION> oil recycling plant. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Avondale </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 it was potentially liable for cleanup costs at the plant. <ORGANIZATION> Avondale </ORGANIZATION> asked <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> to defend it in a state proceeding, but <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> failed to respond. Travelers has contended that government proceedings informing a company that it might be responsible for cleanup are technically not lawsuits and thus are not covered by policies. Travelers also claimed, as have other insurance companies, that cleanup costs do not constitute damages within the meaning of comprehensive general coverage. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ruled on Wednesday, however, that <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> was obligated to defend <ORGANIZATION> Avondale </ORGANIZATION> in the state proceedings. `` We think that an ordinary businessman reading this policy would have beleived himself covered by the demands and potential damage claims,'' the court said in its decision. State and federal courts have been divided on whether commercial general-liability policies cover cleanup costs under federal law. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, a professor of environmental law at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday the ruling was important because many policies are issued out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said the ruling reverses a recent string of victories by insurance companies. Travelers attorney <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyskocil </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the insurer will appeal.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s third-quarter earnings fell 30.6 percent, the company said Friday, blaming the decline on a sluggish domestic electronics industry, especially in computers and defense. Net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $ 65 million, or 67 cents per share, compared to $ 93.7 million, or $ 1.03 per share, in the same period last year. Third-quarter income includes $ 28 million in royalties, up from $ 21 million last year. Net sales billed declined to $ 1.54 billion from $ 1.58 billion.

 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> has stepped up its efforts to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from hiring producers <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> to head the entertainment company <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> plans to acquire, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. A motion for a preliminary injunction, filed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, asks a judge to bar <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> from hiring the `` Batman'' producers, who are trying to get out of a five-year contract they signed with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. The action follows a $ 1 billion lawsuit filed last week by <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, and a $ 100 million countersuit <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> filed against <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, said he believed <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> filed the suit for publicity and bargaining purposes. `` I do n't think it's real,'' <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said. `` It's a further attempt to hammer <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>.'' The producers contend they had a verbal agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> that they would be allowed out of their contract if a chance to run a big studio came along. But in affidavits filed Thursday, top <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> executives denied that was true. The motion for an injunction also is meant to allow <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> to keep working for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> while the opposing lawsuits go through the legal system, a process that could take years, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinowitz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> have about 50 projects planned for the next few years, including sequels to the megahit `` Batman.'' Without the injunction, the producers could possibly find themselves unable to work for either company during the litigation, <PERSON> Robinowitz </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> recently announced plans to put <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, whose credits also include `` Rain Man,'' in charge of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> after it acquires the entertainment company in a $ 3.4 billion tender offer. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> also plans to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Guber-Peters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 200 million, or $ 17.50 per share. But <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> contended in court papers the move to hire away <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> would violate its five-year exclusive production contract with the producers. A hearing on the injunction was scheduled for Nov. 2. The filing for the injunction came on the heels of lawsuits <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> filed against each other last week in <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it has agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Tana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a deal valued at $ 476.5 million _ part of a continuing effort to expand oil and gas reserves and <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s first major purchase since completing a massive restructuring earlier this year The merger with <PERSON> Corpus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON>, Texas-based <ORGANIZATION> Tana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> TRT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, includes the purchase of 435 billion cubic feet of natural gas and about 4 million barrels of oil located in 17 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> fields, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 95.1 million in cash and the remaining $ 381.4 million in shares of a new, non-voting issue of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> Series E variable-rate preferred stock. The acquisition, subject to the approval of government regulators, is expected to be completed by the end of the year, said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We have long said that our selected focus is to maintain a strong reserve base in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON>. `` This agreement ... will increase <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic reserves at a very attractive price. Industry analysts said the merger was not a surprise. `` Now that they have reduced debt significantly, they can do this,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knuettel </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has made a number of sales; this is their first big buy.'' Some analysts said the purchase was significant in that it showed a reversal from recent years when <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> entered <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and underwent a major restructuring. `` This sets a new course in terms of reversing the direction of the last couple of years when they were divesting assets,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in April 1987 to avoid having to post a multibillion-dollar security bond in its fight with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> had sued claiming <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 1984 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> interfered with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s prior contract to buy part of reserve-rich A <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> jury awarded <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> a $ 10.3 billion judgment. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> appealed but eventually settled with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3 billion.

Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> turned a profit of $ 1.3 billion, compared with a 1987 loss of $ 4.14 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has said the company expects a further improvement in 1989. The Tana purchase strengthens <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s position as a seller and producer of natural gas in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> already is one of the largest producers of natural gas in this country. `` We feel that natural gas is a fine fuel for the future for the highest and best use _ for home heating, for power generation, for cogeneration and for environmental concerns.'' <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> said, however, he does not expect natural gas to challenge gasoline as a motor fuel. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, starting with the 1984 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, has attempted to improve its eroding domestic reserve base.

 Oil futures prices dipped in light trading Friday, led by a big drop in the expiring crude contract. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grade of crude oil, fell 44 cents to finish at $ 19.98 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract slid 14 cents on Thursday. Analysts said the decline came from investors liquidating their positions on the final trading day of the contract. `` There was no indication of new factors in the market,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was selling because it was overbought.'' Crude contracts for delivery after November showed smaller declines.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s prosperity determines how much help it can give minority businesses, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Friday. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has several programs aimed at increasing its dealings with minorities, such as its `` statement of fair-share principles'' agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> breakfast in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, that the world's largest auto company hopes to start more programs. `` But I must tell you our ability to make these kinds of investments _ and to fulfill our fair-share commitments _ depends pretty heavily on the health and profitability of our business,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, according to a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> news release. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON> said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was n't casting doubt on the future of current programs, but pointing out that auto companies are in a competitive pinch. `` All those programs are going forward,'' <PERSON> Licari </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>What Makes The ``Dow'' Go?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average plunges more than 200 points one week and rebounds by more than 100 the next, what sense can any follower of the stock market make of it all? That's precisely what has happened this month, in an appropriately dramatic observance of the anniversaries of both the `` market meltdown'' of 1987 and the Great Crash of 1929. After taking a 216.26-point slide Oct. 9-13, it climbed a record 119.88 points last week. An onlooker might dismiss this performance as just another example of the anything-goes mentality that has prevailed on Wall Street for much of the 1980s. It might, with some accuracy, also be ascribed to the mischievous forces of program trading, which allows traders to deluge the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with millions of dollars worth of orders in the blink of a computer terminal screen. Whatever its other causes, it must be noted that some of the `` volatility'' exhibited by the Dow average these days is a mathematical illusion. Though its caretakers have taken considerable pains to preserve it as a Wall Street institution, the Dow average simply is not quite the same creature it was 10 or 20 years ago. The most obvious difference is its natural tendency to post larger daily point gains now that it has reached levels two, three or even five times where it stood a decade or two ago. The average's 190.58 loss on Friday the 13th this month was its second largest point decline ever, exceeded only by the 508-point drop it suffered on Black Monday two years ago. But in percentage terms, it did n't even make the top ten in the Wall Street record books. A second important, and more subtle, change has arisen from the way the average is adjusted over time to take into account developments such as splits in its component stocks. If there never were any such changes in its makeup, the average could be computed at any time simply by adding up the prices of the 30 individual stocks, and then dividing by 30. But because innumerable splits have taken place over the years, the divisor has steadily dwindled down, dropping below 1 in 1986. It now stands at 0.61. That means that if each of the 30 stocks in the Dow were to rise or fall 1 point, the average would show a gain or loss of 49 points. In fact, the divisor has shrunk by more than half since the end of 1983. Periodically in recent years, some Wall Streeters have urged that the Dow itself be split _ reduced to one-half or one-third of its previous value, with a proportionate revision of the divisor and adjustment of historical data _ in order to lessen the perceived volatility of stock prices. These campaigns have n't ever gone very far, however, since such a move would put a great many asterisks in market history and create the possibility of a lot of confusion. `` The industrial average's historical continuity ... is one of its most popular features,'' wrote <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillery </PERSON>, a long-time market chronicler for The Wall Street Journal, in a 1986 book on the history of the Dow. The debate on such matters promises to continue. As the Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Babson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Report </ORGANIZATION> puts it in a current look at the average: `` Some say it is too small, stodgy and misleading, but the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average is still ` the market' to most people.''

 Call it opportunity or ghoulish economics, but the killer <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake of 1989 has aroused enthusiasm among investors and speculators as a new source of multibillion dollar profits. The 6.9 Richter Scale temblor that heaved the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area this past week was by far the worst to hit the region since the Great Quake of 1906 and was the third major natural disaster to befall the country in weeks. Parts of the South still are cleaning up from two big hurricanes. Almost immediately after the quake collapsed buildings and entombed dead motorists in crushed cars under a toppled freeway, the dispassionate market strategists of stocks and bonds were busy reckoning which companies would benefit from demand for reconstruction and an outpouring of federal aid. Damage estimates surpassed $ 4 billion by Friday. Shares of homebuilders, cement makers and lumber companies got a big boost from the quake. Some large insurance companies also benefited on the hunch that they would be able to use the opportunity to raise rates. A few leading Wall Street brokerages were touting <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, as opportunities in what The Wall Street Journal described as `` the best post-quake plywood plays.'' That may sound horrifying and repugnant, but many economists say such a reaction misses the point. They argue that the quick response by investors is part of the efficiency that makes the American economy function smoothly. Some even contend that profound calamities like earthquakes and hurricanes actually boost overall economic growth over a long period of time by creating an enormous demand for goods and services in afflicted areas. A few suggested the earthquake helped stabilize the wobbly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock market. `` The initial impact is a drain on the growth rate of the economy,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, director of economics for <ORGANIZATION> ASB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> investment concern. But later, he said, `` what is torn down gets rebuilt. And that rebuilding activity is obviously a generator of income and employment and acts as a positive factor, a positive thrust.'' Other economists sharply disagree with that line of thinking. They say disasters are bad, period. `` I guess I do n't have a lot of sympathy with the argument that if you want to have a robust economy, you ought to have a war,'' said <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Fosler </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based business research group. `` I think the perverse impact of this kind of disaster, economic activity, just goes to show you can get very perverse results if you look at the wrong targets,'' she said. `` You would have been net better off had you not had the disaster.'' <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Claremont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm in <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said the argument that disasters create economic growth is flawed because wealth must be destroyed first. `` You have a tremendous growth spurt, but it's from a lower base,'' she said. `` A few years later, net you're worse off. You have n't produced something new that you did n't have yesterday.'' <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Henshaw </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Civicbankcorp </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said there probably was some truth to the idea that the infrastructure damage to the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan area would generate much more economic activity. He said rumors were circulating that vast areas of downtown office space in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> were condemned because of damage. `` That means some of the overcapacity has gone away. That will help,'' he said. `` It's somewhat black humor, but at least we've got the capacity to rebuild. In other business and economic news this past week: _ The weakened stock market largely recovered after one of the most uncertain weeks since the Black Monday crash exactly two years earlier Investment professionals attributed the comeback largely to a realization among many investors that conditions responsible for the 1987 plunge were n't evident. _ Proposed takeovers of the nation's two biggest airlines grew more unlikely <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> dropped its backing of an employee-management group attempting to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a debt-financed deal valued at $ 6.75 billion, and developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> scrapped his $ 7 billion proposal for <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ The government issued more conflicting signals on economic growth September housing starts sank 5.2 percent and consumer prices rose 0.2 percent, suggesting the economy is slowing down. But the trade deficit swelled sharply in August because of rising imports, suggesting inflation remains a threat. _ The doll industry said goodbye to <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> and hello again to the Cabbage Patch kids The Matchbox toy company capitulated to pressure from a fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> group urging it to scrap plans to market a doll based on the fiend in the `` Nightmare on Elm Street'' movies, and <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> began a hard-sell campaign to pitch the cuddly Cabbage Patch family bought from <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock market posted mixed results Friday, closing out a week of record-setting recovery from the scary selloff of Oct. 13. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.94 to 2,689.14, stretching its gain for the week to 119.88 points. The previous largest weekly point gain for the average was 114.86, in the week ended June 3, 1988. In five days' time the Dow has recovered more than half its Friday-the-13th loss of 190.58 points. Declines outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 in the daily tally of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 662 up, 829 down and 478 unchanged. Analysts said optimism about the takeover outlook, after slowly reviving in recent days, suffered a new setback when <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said it would n't take part in any effort to revive a buyout deal for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> shares, which traded as high as 294 before buyout plans for the company ran into trouble, tumbled 21 | to 168 However, in contrast to a week earlier when the deal first went sour, the action in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> was no longer dragging the rest of the market down with it. This week many analysts have suggested that fading enthusiasm for takeover speculation might be a plus for the overall market, by restoring an emphasis on such traditional reference points as earnings and dividend growth. Brokers also noted that traders were proceeding cautiously as they waited for the passing of another monthly `` witching hour'' involving the last trading of expiring stock options and stock index futures contracts. As it turned out, the occasion seemed to work in the market's favor by producing some buying of blue chips near the close In addition, some observers said the market was still feeling the positive effects of the government report Thursday that the consumer price index rose just 0.2 percent in September. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> rose \ to 43 |; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> gained -RRB- to 46 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> added -RRB- to 70 -RCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> was up -LRB- at 104 <ORGANIZATION> Hercules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which reported a third-quarter earnings gain that evidently fell short of investors' hopes, fell 3 \ to 44 -RRB- Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 164.83 million shares, down from 198.12 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 192.47 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 0.93 billion, or 0.03 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks slipped .05 to 192.12. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell .27 to 396.30, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up .03 at 347.16 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped .13 to 470.67. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 382.57, down .24.

 The television arms of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> have described to some station executives a plan to offer prime-time programming two nights a week as a step toward creating a fifth TV network, industry executives said Friday. The network the executives said was described by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> would compete with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Reports of plans for the network were carried first by <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION>, the trade newspaper, earlier this week and several major newspapers subsequently carried similar accounts of the plans But the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the deal apparently had fallen apart. Citing an unidentified source familiar with the deal, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said there was a `` so-called programming service that had been on the boards, but a snag developed in the agreement between Paramount and <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>, as a result of which this activity has been discontinued.'' A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that her company does not comment on rumors or speculation. A call was placed to <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> TV in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, but it was not returned and others in the company said they were not authorized to comment on any of the reports. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Turell </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said `` some of our affiliates have been contacted'' by Paramount and <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> about whether they would be interested in carrying some prime-time programming. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, president and general manager at <ORGANIZATION> KTXL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and head of the <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> affiliates board, said at least one <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> affiliate who he declined to identify told him that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> executives had described plans to make two nights of prime-time programming available starting Jan. 1, 1991. The plans were to program movies on Wednesday nights and offer TV series on Friday nights, he said. The plans were to make a third night of programming available about six months later, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, who said he was not approached by Paramount or <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>, said he was told <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> were interested in starting a fifth network. But <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said he thought it was unlikely that any <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> affiliates would defect. `` They have been with <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> for three years and <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> has done precisely what they said they were going to do,'' he said. Fox offers network programming on three nights and claims 127 affiliate stations. It plans to add two additional nights of programming next year and offer programming on all seven nights a week in 1992. <PERSON> Turell </PERSON> said top <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> executives planned to meet with <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> affiliates in a series of six regional meetings next week to reaffirm the company's plans. <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> owns <ORGANIZATION> WWOR-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> last month agreed to buy a 79 percent stake in the <ORGANIZATION> TVX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which owns five stations.

 Though the financial storm that many feared never struck, Wall Street analysts still are n't sure the stock market is headed for clear sailing in the weeks and months ahead. To government regulators, securities industry officials and just about anyone else with a stake in the well-being of the market, the past week provided a pleasant surprise. As the workweek began Monday, the Street was braced for a possible replay of the crash of 1987, following the `` Friday the 13th massacre'' in which the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 190 points. Instead, blue-chip stocks began a rally that spread to many smaller, secondary issues as the week progressed. Once the commotion began to die down, many observers concluded stocks had simply experienced a sharp but short `` correction'' that had little bearing on either the outlook for the economy or long-term investment prospects. Maybe so, say analysts now, but even if it was only a coincidence, the market's sudden drop came at a time when the trend in corporate profits was showing some early signs of weakening. Furthermore, technical analysts have questioned whether it was n't a bit too pat to chalk up the Oct. 13 decline as a handy catch-up buying opportunity for investors who had missed out on the gains in stock prices earlier in the year. `` It may be many weeks before we can fully understand the long-term impact of Oct. 13 on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> equity market,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthel </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Hopper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soliday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` For now it suffices to say that serious technical damage to the long-standing uptrend has occurred.'' There has been no notable revival lately on Wall Street of the recession fears so widely voiced at midsummer. Confidence has remained high that the economy can achieve a `` soft landing'' that provides the chance for renewed growth as 1990 passes. Still, `` even a soft landing is n't painless,'' observed <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerschner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pradilla </PERSON>, analysts at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Historically, soft landings for the overall economy have been hard landings for profits.'' Forecasters are n't calling for any drastic drop in earnings just now. But many do contend that the strong gains of the past couple of years are giving way to a leveling off or moderate decline. `` The ` thrill is gone' from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate profits,'' said <PERSON> Abby </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an investment strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Profit growth has decelerated, return on equity has peaked.'' Such cautionary notes did n't do much to dampen investors' enthusiasm for marked-down merchandise in the stock market this past week The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 216.26 points the week before, rebounded a record 119.88 to 2,689.14. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index rose 6.56 to 192.12; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market gained 3.34 to 470.63, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 3.88 at 382.57. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 234.04 million shares a day, against 161.95 million the week before. Optimists on the market outlook say stocks can weather a temporary earnings decline if investors are able to see signs of a future revival of profit expansion. `` Subpar growth means negative earnings comparisons for cyclical companies,'' acknowledged <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` But it would take more economic weakness than we are looking for to create a significant drop in overall corporate earnings.''

President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been pressing hard for a capital-gains tax cut. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat, told reporters it is difficult to predict a vote on the issue because there is no certainty what type of capital-gains cut the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be considering.

Democrats, most of whom stiffly oppose any cut in capital-gains taxes, might filibuster against <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>'s plan, and it would take 60 votes to shut off debate. <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Del., are sponsoring a plan to exclude between 5 percent and 35 percent of capital gains from taxation, depending on how long an asset was owned before it was sold The bill also would let workers set up Individual Retirement Accounts that would allow tax-free withdrawals for medical expenses, education, home-buying or retirement. The Packwood-Roth plan is backed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The president also supports a less-ambitious capital-gains cut that has been passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over opposition of the Democratic leadership. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat, said the Packwood-Roth plan `` raises real questions about fiscal responsibility.'' Tax benefits for IRAs are going to cost the same whether the benefits are provided at the time a contribution is made _ as under current law _ or when a withdrawal is made from an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, as <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> are recommending, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` The only question is which generation is going to pay for it,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. The Democratic leader took a swipe at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for pressing so hard for the capital-gains cut that he promised in last year's presidential campaign `` I would like to see the president devote as much time to presidential policy in response to historic events in Western and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` I'd like to see him devote a fraction of the time to that, that he is to this capital-gains debacle.''

<HEAD>Pacific Stock Exchange Plans to Resume Operations Monday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it would resume normal trading at its <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> home on Monday after the Bay Quake shut it down and traders were dispatched around the country to keep the market alive. `` Our facilities are intact,'' exchange chairman <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Public safety authorities and building inspectors have examined our options trading floor in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and declared it sound structurally and safe for occupancy.'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> also said the exchange's equities trading floor and other facilities were safe and the opening bell would ring Monday at 6:30 a.m. PST. About 150 Pacific options traders and support staffers were sent to exchanges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on Thursday and Friday to trade stock options that are listed solely on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> exchange. Some trading occurred Wednesday, the day after the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area's devastating earthquake, at the exchange in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where dealers worked with the aid of flashlights and candles, rerouting trades via phone through <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> The traders were relocated east because the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> exchange does not trade options. The <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> exchange trades options _ which many investors use to hedge their stock positions _ in 130 underlying stocks, with some 70,000 contracts changing hands on an average day. Among big-name stocks that have options traded only on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> exchange are <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` On Monday we will have business as usual on all of our trading floors,'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. `` Markets will be made, orders will be filled and the <ORGANIZATION> PSE </ORGANIZATION> will continue to meet its public responsibility as a securities marketplace.''

<HEAD>Avoiding Another Crash: Markets, Players Mobilized With '87 in Mind</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At 2:40 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 13, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> halted trading in shares of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on reports that a $ 6.75 billion buyout was collapsing. Instantly the news poisoned the market for stocks of other takeover targets. If financing fizzled for the labor-management takeover of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent, what deal was safe? By 3 p.m. the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average had tumbled 56.97 points. Panic spread through the hundreds of traders, specialists and clerks on the floor of the three-story trading atrium. `` Every arb and his brother sold everything he could get his hands on,'' said a major Wall Street arbitrager who dumped a large <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stake at a loss. By day's end, the Dow average declined 190.58 points, the second-largest point drop in history. And all thoughts turned to Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, when the market crashed after a similar Friday selloff. In the 65 hours from Friday's close to the market's opening Monday, unprecedented steps were taken to keep credit lines open, promote post-crash safety measures and allay investors' fears. Interviews with exchange leaders, government officials and market professionals show that those steps _ all taken with 1987 in mind _ helped stop the Friday the 13th selloff from becoming Nightmare on Wall Street Part II. `` It was knowing that the possible consequence of inaction could be so dire that we all had to act that way,'' said <PERSON> Ivers </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, senior vice president at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The bounce-back also suggested that leadership, more than regulation, proved the key to holding the markets together. What prevented a second coronary, officials said, was not `` circuit-breaker'' trading halts, but a determination to maintain calm so that orderly buying and selling _ even high-volume computerized trading _ could proceed. `` The more progress we can make towards bringing the regulation into one place, or to bring it into a high degree of coordination, the better off we're going to be at it,'' Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. Extraordinary action was evident everywhere, from <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> backrooms in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, to trading rooms at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> brokerages, to suburban living rooms where executives mapped strategies while the World Series played on TV. _ After checking his bank credit line, a veteran <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> specialist arranged $ 20 million in emergency financing from friends _ just in case of another Black Monday The specialist had to buy a remarkable $ 25 million of stock in 75 minutes Friday, doubling his normal daily inventory, to fulfill his role as a `` market maker'' who ensures smooth trading. _ <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> officials analyzed Friday's trading and telephoned important market participants `` We were at it all weekend,'' one source said. _ About 200 Amex traders and officials gathered Saturday to complete the paperwork on Friday's hectic dealings <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> leaders called member firms and specialists to ensure they had adequate capital should the market collapse. Technicians checked computers that <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> officials had hailed for months as fully capable of handling enormous volumes. _ Retail brokerages opened offices in a broad campaign to ease fears Executives at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ whose 6,500 brokers at 325 branch offices fielded client calls all weekend _ dictated the company line via the firm's nationwide communications network: `` This is not 1987.'' Despite those assurances, the spooky similarities between Friday the 13th and Friday, Oct. 16, 1987, dominated everyone's thinking. Fears about rising interest rates and the decline of the 1980s takeover boom played roles in both Friday slides. The market already was down about 25 points when the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> announcement hit. Arbitragers _ stock speculators who seek to profit on short-term rises in takeover targets like <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> _ exited quickly. Money managers for pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds followed. Some reported phone lines were so clogged they could n't get orders in _ another Black Monday reminder. `` You had a bandwagon psychology,'' one <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> floor specialist said. `` They became fearful for a repeat of the crash and you had a headlong retreat.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cramer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm that manages $ 20 million in assets, reduced the stock segment of its portfolio from 35 percent to 10 percent, joining a wave triggered by frantic selling of stock-index futures. Many professional trading strategies exploit the links between the stock market and contracts traded in the futures markets that are based on the future prices of large groups of stocks. `` Once the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> deal broke there were massive sell programs in futures,'' said <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> president, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON>. Hot lines among the major exchanges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, installed after the 1987 crash, were opened Friday when the market began tumbling. Phone links also were established with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. After the close, even the biggest firms checked with banks to ensure they had adequate capital and credit lines that could be expanded if necessary. Traders stayed late into the night dissecting what happened. Some Wall Street executives conferred in emergency sessions on Saturday and Sunday, but panic was n't apparent; the president of one major brokerage attended `` family weekend'' at his daughter's upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> college The firms _ whose long-term profitability depends on demand for stocks _ worked to control the damage. At 5:30 p.m. Friday, for example, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement aimed at soothing investors, noting what it called the differences between 1989 and 1987. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> and its competitors emphasized the economy was slowing and the dollar was strong, vs. October 1987 when the economy was growing sharply and the dollar weak. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> analysts compiled a list of stocks to recommend. `` What we had to do was kind of say, ` You should not overreact and liquidate positions. The right thing to do is stay in there,''' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sichenzio </PERSON>, retail group president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>. Still, Wall Street feared two major possibilities: Investors would ignore the advice and overseas markets would react negatively to Friday's selloff. In an attempt to forestall those prospects, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> official said Saturday the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would inject as much money as necessary into the banking system to avoid a crisis. It was an extraordinary pronouncement by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, which almost never discloses its intentions. In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> did n't act until after the crash. NYSEofficials, meanwhile, touted post-crash innovations designed to stem a market landslide, including the `` circuit breakers'' that would halt trading temporarily in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> if prices sunk below certain levels. On Sunday night, Wall Street strategists gathered to monitor the market opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where it was Monday morning. The Japanese market fell less than 2 percent and stabilized. At <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the biggest Wall Street brokerages, equities divisions held a 6 a.m. strategy session with linkups to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` I do n't feel at all that this is a situation that's comparable to 1987 and that we're looking at a big crash,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s chief strategist, <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON>, told employees in an 8:15 a.m. video and telephone hookup. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market opened lower, partly because stock-index futures prices in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> tumbled and stock prices followed. But a lack of selling by large institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies sent a positive signal. When a major futures index suddenly turned upward, so did the underlying blue-chip stocks, where bargains abounded, like <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> at less than $ 100 a share. The Dow Jones rallied, finishing up 88 points on the day, and the crisis faded. The absence of `` portfolio insurance,'' a strategy blamed for accelerating the 1987 decline in stock and stock-index futures prices, may have helped arrest another panic, some professionals said. But some forms of program trading were still very much in evidence. In the end, it may have been the fear of disaster that prevented one. `` People certainly have a memory,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuckler </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They were a lot more concerned. I think being very conscious of what happened two years ago was very positive.''

<HEAD>Copper Futures Plummet On Canadian Strike Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices plummeted to new lows for the month Friday as a 3 -LCB- - month strike at a large Canadian copper mine ended and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s biggest copper mine reportedly prepared to reopen after a two-month shutdown On other commodity markets Friday, precious metals were nearly flat; energy futures fell; grains and soybeans retreated; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced. Copper futures settled 2.9 sents to 4.5 cents lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for December delivery at $ 1.2345 a pound, its lowest price since Sept. 29. Union workers at the <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> copper mine in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> ratified a new contract Thursday night, ending a strike that began July 6, and were to report to work Saturday, said company spokesman <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Killough </PERSON>. The mine is capable of producing 180,000 tons of copper annually, more than 3 percent of the world's output. Analysts said new supplies from <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> could begin reaching copper consumers within a month. A wire-service report that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s state-owned Cananea mine may reopen within a week helped further to ease the tight-supply fears that have supported the copper market for about four months. The 160,000 tons-per-year mine closed Aug. 20, allegedly due to financial mismanagement. Another major copper mine, the <LOCATION> Bougainville </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, remains shut down due to terrorist activity. But even that situation appears to be improving, three months after the mine closed, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, a metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There's some talk that the landowners are trying to hold out an olive branch to meet with the rebels,'' <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> said. `` It's hard to say if we're really near any kind of resolution but one can say it's a little more optimistic than it looked before.'' Gold futures settled unchanged on the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> with December at $ 370.60 a troy ounce; silver was 0.7 cent to 0.9 cent higher with December at $ 5.14 an ounce. Oil futures prices dipped in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, led by a 44-cent drop in the expiring November crude contract to $ 19.98 a barrel. Other West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 27 cents lower to 4 cents higher with December at $ 20.15 a barrel; heating oil was .37 cent to .52 cent lower with November at 60.44 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .14 cent to .45 cent lower with November at 54.51 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures finished slightly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting pre-weekend profit-taking after a week of substantial gains in the corn and soybean markets. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced a sale of 2.8 million metric tons of corn and 160,000 metric tons of soybean meal to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Wheat futures settled -LCB- cent to -RCB- cent lower with December at $ 4.07 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 2 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.41 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 1.44 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower with November at $ 5.63 -LCB- a bushel. Cattle futures settled lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s quarterly cattle-on-feed report while pork futures advanced The report showed 6 percent fewer cattle being fattened for slaughter as of Oct. 1 compared to a year ago in the 13 largest cattle-producing states. The number was lower than anticipated and is likely to prompt some buying of cattle futures on Monday. The October live cattle contract expired 1.17 cents lower at 73.25 cents a pound; the October live hog contract expired .30 cent lower at 49.05 cents a pound. Other live cattle contracts settled .03 cent to .27 cent lower with December at 75.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .20 cent lower with October at 82.80 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .35 cent lower with December at 46.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .75 cent to 1.05 cents lower with February at 52.85 cents a pound. Stock-index futures rose modestly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .85 point higher at 350.45. The contract is valued at $ 500 a point.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Finish Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government bond prices finished lower Friday in sluggish trading, weighed down by concerns about a heavy supply of new issues. The 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond lost \ point, or $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 in face amount, after being up as much as $ 3.75 earlier in the day. Its yield rose to 7.98 percent from 7.96 percent late Thursday. Analysts said the market's early rise was an extension of Thursday's rally, which saw 30-year bond prices rise by about $ 8 for every $ 1,000 in face value due to a report of a smaller-than-expected rise in consumer prices last month. But they said prices gave ground in slow activity in the afternoon as traders apparently took profits on the recent runup in prices and others looked toward a large supply of new issues that is to be auctioned next week. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, prices of short-term governments fell 5-32 point, intermediate maturities lost 6-32 point and long-term issues dropped as much as \ point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.79 to 1,187.63. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.05 to 337.85. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds fell 11-32 point to 92 17-32. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.34 percent from 7.31 percent late Thursday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 7.80 percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to 7.56 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.95 percent as the discount lost 1 basis point to 7.55 percent. Yields on one-year bills held steady at 7.87 percent as the discount was unchanged from Thursday's auction level at 7.34 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 811-16 percent, the same as Thursday's late rate.

<HEAD>BP Sells Australian Coal Interests to CRA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 British <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it has agreed to sell its Australian coal business to <ORGANIZATION> CRA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 275 million in cash, as part of a recently announced restructuring of the London-based company The deal, announced after a meeting of British Petroleum executives and securities analysts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, is expected to be closed on Nov. 30. The sale is subject to approval by government regulators. `` This is the first step in the divestment of our worldwide coal interests,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillam </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> managing director. <ORGANIZATION> CRA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> is a mining and minerals company based in <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> currently has about 770 million tons of extractable reserves, the company said. On June 15, <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> announced it would put up for sale the major part of its worldwide coal interests, including assets and operations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The sale is part of a previously announced restructuring of British Petroleum, the world's fourth largest oil concern. In addition to reorganizing its exploration and production operations, the company is also reducing its work force by 17 percent, or 1,700 jobs. British Petroleum said it would use the proceeds from the coal sale to `` strengthen our balance sheet and to take advantage of investment opportunities for our other businesses.'' Analysts estimate BP's long-term debt will be about $ 8.8 billion at the end of 1989. BP has sold approximately $ 6.5 billion in assets this year alone. Last month, BP announced it was selling a portion of its North Sea properties as well as exploration assets in six countries to <ORGANIZATION> Oryx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for $ 1.31 billion. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>, managing director and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> CRA </ORGANIZATION>, said the sale was a good move for the <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> company. `` The purchase of BP <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s coal business ... will fit well with <ORGANIZATION> CRA </ORGANIZATION>'s existing coal business,'' he said. `` It will strengthen the group's base in the coal business and contribute to its profitable growth.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday its profit fell about 63 percent in the latest quarter, attributing the decline to weakness in newspaper advvertising linage and declines in newsprint sales. Profit fell to $ 3.94 million, or 15 cents a share, from $ 10.8 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $ 142.3 million from $ 181.8 million during the same period last year, the company said. During the first nine months of 1989, profit fell to $ 21.9 million, or 84 cents a share, from $ 38.4 million, or $ 1.34 a share, a year earlier. Revenue totaled $ 441.5 million, compared with $ 564.4 million the year before. The company said the sale last year of the broadcast services unit and a newsprint mill in <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, account for the decline in revenues. The company said there was encouraging growth in net paid circulation of its newspapers.

<HEAD>Pittston Earnings Drop 79 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday reported third-quarter earnings fell about 79 percent to $ 3.1 million from $ 14.7 million during the same period last year, a decrease primarily caused by losses in the company's strike-bound coal division. Earnings per share fell to 8 cents during this year's third quarter from 38 cents during the third quarter of 1988, the company said. Revenue edged down to $ 395.3 million from $ 398.3 million a year earlier. Losses at the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> increased to $ 9.8 million in the third quarter, up from $ 3.6 million in the second quarter, as the strike of <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> coal mines widened. The company said it has spent $ 20 million since the strike began to protect its employees and property from strike-related violence. But while <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings fell, another <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> division, <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, had $ 9.2 million in earnings in the third quarter, up from $ 3.8 million during the same period last year, the company said. Third-quarter earnings at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s Brink's division were $ 7.1 million, virtually unchanged from the same quarter last year, the company said. For the first nine months of its fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> said earnings fell to $ 22.6 million, or 60 cents a share, from $ 33.4 million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 1.23 billion from $ 1.17 billion.

 <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it had filed for bankruptcy protection, 10 days after its Australian parent's $ 1.5 billion deal to buy <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> collapsed over a missed $ 50 million down payment. The announcement crushed <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> stock, which lost more than 60 percent of its value Friday. It fell $ 2.62 -LCB- to $ 1.50 in over-the-counter trading. The television production and distribution company was unable to make an overdue payment of $ 5.9 million by a key Thursday deadline, a lapse that could have triggered a devastating wave of demands from creditors, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> is 43 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which had provided about $ 110 million in capital to the American company over the past four years. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, said the American company had been assured by its Australian parent that it would get the $ 5.9 million by the deadline Thursday. But at a board meeting Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> indicated it was `` unable or unwilling'' to help <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> make the payment, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. The payment was related to a distribution deal involving <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. The <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> studios and <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company's other operating subsidiary, also filed for protection from creditors under protection of federal bankruptcy law. The announcement underlined the difficulty that <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> faces in reviving a bid for <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>. The Australian company had approached <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and several foreign companies about helping finance the takeover. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> had been expected to be part of the emerging company, but officials said they now envision <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> going its own way if it can successfully reorganize under protection from its creditors. `` We think we have a very viable company here, but we had to do this to protect our shareholders,'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, the chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. `` We do not believe at this time that the company will require additional financing while in Chapter 11,'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. He said production would continue on such programs as the syndicated sports and variety program `` Roller Games'' and a Hallmark Hall of Fame two-hour special starring <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthau </PERSON>, `` Incident at Lincoln Bluff.'' The company expects to have about $ 100 million in revenues this year. Its other programs include `` Kids Incorporated,'' in its sixth season on the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION>, and `` The New Leave It to Beaver'' syndicated show. As of the end of its third quarter April 30, <PERSON> Quintex </PERSON> had liabilities of $ 155 million and assets of $ 218 million. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION>, but broke off the deal Oct. 9 after <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> missed the $ 50 million down payment. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> also filed a $ 50 million breach-of-contract suit in federal court, accusing <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> of interfering with an earlier $ 1.4 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> was not a party to the formal merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> and is not named in the lawsuit <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> also announced that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> had resigned as president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, but said he would continue as a full-time consultant until a successor can be named.
