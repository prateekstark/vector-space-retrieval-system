<TEXT>
 ABC News is developing a new prime-time news program that could show up on the network's schedule next fall, says <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>. `` They're developing a couple of shows and I think there's a possibility ABC News would have another hour prime time come fall, I just do n't know what time period or when or what the show would be, but there is active development in that area,'' <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> told a news conference on Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> programmer stirred controversy last year when he announced he was moving <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 20-20'' newsmagazine out of its successful Thursday night time period. The news division feared the show's ratings would decline, but much of its audience apparently followed it to Friday and it finished the season in the mid-range of the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> rankings. If there is a new news show, it might be the only new show ready to start in the fall. <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said he was n't optimistic of an early end to the 6-week-old <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> strike. He suggested if it lasts into June, it could substantially delay the start of the 1988-89 television season, causing more defections by network viewers to alternatives like cable and videocassettes. According to <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> figures, the three networks lost 9 percent of their audience between last season and this season, though the networks blame part of the reduction on a change in <LOCATION> Nielsen </LOCATION>'s audience measurement system <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said a delay in the start of the new season would force networks the keep running repeats. `` In addition to that, when the strike is finished, and we start putting programs on the air, there's going to be tremendous pressure to get something up on that screen, and maybe it ai n't perfect when we do,'' he said `` I think there also could be some erosion caused by the lack of quality. This is a very serious problem.'' Of this season's new shows, <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said he was most disappointed in `` Dolly!'' and that the network was considering buying out star <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> and canning the show next year. <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> got a two-year guarantee last year. `` As you all know, we actually have the right not to do the show,'' <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said. `` There is a penalty payment we would pay if we did not go ahead on the second year.'' He would not say how much it is. <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> also listed `` Moonlighting'' as a disappointment. Formerly a top-10 show, `` Moonlighting'' dropped into the top 20 this season, due to frequent repeats and episodes without <PERSON> Cybill </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> during her pregnancy. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said, the show most likely will be back next season. Other likely returnees are `` The Wonder Years'' and `` thirtysomething.'' <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said he was optimistic that `` Hooperman'' would be renewed and that executive producer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> had even developed a spinoff. `` The ` Slap' Maxwell Story'' is going to be a tough call, <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said. While happy his network was second this season in the Nielsen ratings, with an average, prime-time rating of 13.7 to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' 13.5, <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said the performance really was `` not that terrific.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had a 16.1. Without high-rated prime-time sports programming _ the World Series, the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics _ <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> actually was third in the ratings. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million homes with televisions.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> gave <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders what they wanted, a front-runner, but the history of their roller-coaster process made many reluctant to declare that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had the nominaton locked up. `` We no longer have the winner-a-week syndrome,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruvolo </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. But he quickly added, `` I do n't think you can say it's over.'' One of the few party leaders willing to describe <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the nominee was <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, deputy chair of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we have a nominee,'' said <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>. But she warned that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign must be `` very careful not to look as though it's a done deal.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said many of the elected and party officials, designated as super delegates to the nominating convention, may be reluctant to jump too quickly onto the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> bandwagon. `` They're going to want to be real careful about angering <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his supporters,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. `` I, for one, am very sensitive about offending that constituency.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' big victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> essentially knocked Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> out of the race, finally paring the Democratic field down to a two-man contest _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> versus <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was assured of a big delegate harvest in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> next Tuesday after <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> filled only about 65 percent of the 178 delegate slots at stake. But caution stemmed in part from the fact that for months every time a candidate was on verge of claiming front-runner status, the voters knocked him down a peg. An even stronger factor was the formidable presence of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the need now to seriously confront the often-asked question, `` What does <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> want?'' On the campaign trail, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> relishes ridiculing that question, responding with a recitation of the basic liberal <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> agenda _ a higher minimum wage, health care, housing, a shifting of priorities away from those of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Repeatedly, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has also said he wanted to `` enable our party to win'' and was determined to `` play a role in making that happen.'' When a questioner at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> breakfast asked <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> what he would do if he did n't get the nomination, the candidate replied that it was important to `` put the nation first and party second and your role third.'' Among the established leaders of the party there was concern about what <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s large constituency, so essential to Democratic victories in general elections, would do if he failed to get the nomination. <PERSON> Ruvolo </PERSON> said it was important for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to continue campaigning hard in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and other upcoming primary states, to avoid being embarrassed, but also because the contest `` has to be perceived as a fair fight'' by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s supporters. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, `` I think we have to be very careful in these next weeks that Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s candidacy continues to be treated with respect, well-earned credit for everything that he's done for the party.''

 Three top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> aides to Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> are quitting or transferring to new jobs, marking a new round of departures and creating additional problems for Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. All three deputies rejected overtures by aides to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to remain at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> after the abrupt March 29 resignations of <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, department sources said Tuesday. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he expects to hear shortly from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> on whether the former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> president plans to withdraw from consideration as <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' successor. `` Probably tomorrow,'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said Tuesday evening when asked whether there was any word on Shepherd's status. <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, 62, told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> last Friday that he was giving serious consideration to withdrawing because of stress on his family stemming from his selection. A former bookkeeper from <ORGANIZATION> Shepherd </ORGANIZATION>'s law firm testified shortly before <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> recommended him for the post that she had an affair with <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>. The bookkeeper, who was convicted of embezzlement, claimed <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> had told her to write checks to herself. <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> denied that he had an affair with her or that he had authorized her to write checks. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Wednesday's editions, meanwhile, that <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> was recommended for a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> position in late 1984 or early 1985 by <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> associate now under indictment in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Post, quoting <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources, said <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>'s ties to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> came up in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s background checks of Shepherd and `` caused some concern.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> also reported that <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> agreed not to withdraw from consideration until Thursday, to give <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> time to find a replacement. Two other deputies to Burns, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boykin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, also handed in their resignations March 29. The latest exit of personnel would virtually empty the No. 2 office in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of top aides. It is customary for the deputy attorney general to pick his own assistants. But the sources said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s staff has sought to keep top deputies' posts filled following the resignations of <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and the vacancy in the department's No. 3 position due to the departure of Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Trott </PERSON>, who is now a federal judge. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> resigned with <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> out of concern that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continuing legal troubles stemming from a nearly year-long criminal investigation were damaging the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s operations, morale and image. The department sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the latest departures included: <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwiszewski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Walden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ludwiszewski </PERSON>, an associate deputy attorney general who came to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, has handed in his resignation and is negotiating with private <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firms for work, the sources said. <PERSON> Ludwiszewski </PERSON>, who was graduated magna cum laude from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 and was on the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, specialized in legal issues pertaining to the lands and civil rights divisions and the solicitor general's office. <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON>, a Burns deputy who dealt with issues involving the department's criminal and antitrust divisions, is transferring to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where he will become an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. In a move that has been in the planning stages for some time, <PERSON> Walden </PERSON>, an associate deputy attorney general, is to become chief counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. He will leave the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in a few weeks. <PERSON> Walden </PERSON>, who has been with the department since 1983, has helped spearhead the government's various criminal investigations of former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' last day at the department is Friday.

<HEAD>AIDS Cases Likely to Multiply Five Times in Next Three Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of full-blown AIDS cases in the world is likely to increase fivefold in the next three years, and hundreds of millions of people probably engage in activity that leaves them vulnerable, says the head of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS program. `` While it has become fashionable to reassure and state that AIDS will never threaten large populations, we believe that virology, immunology, sociology and epidemiology require us to take the long view, and a more somber view,'' Dr. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> AIDS commission Monday. `` Let us remember that we are still in the early phases of a global epidemic whose first decade gives us every rational reason for concern about the global future of AIDS,'' he said. `` HIV -LRB- the AIDS virus -RRB- does not need to spread rapidly in a population to have a tremendous and gradually expanding cumulative effect.'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said that while no precise figures are available, `` it is likely that several hundred million people around the world may have behaviors which make them potentially vulnerable to infection with HIV.'' While he did not spell out such behavior at that point in his testimony, it was clear he was referring primarily to unprotected sex with potentially infected partners and, secondarily, to drug users sharing needles with people who may be carrying the virus. `` Individual behavior is responsible for most HIV transmission,'' he said. `` This transmission requires the active participation of two persons. Therefore, the chain of transmission can be broken by the individual behavior of either the infected or the non-infected person. For this reason, the proper focus of prevention is behavior.'' He said education is essential to combating the epidemic. `` If intravenous drug users do not understand the words you use to describe needles, syringes and other drug equipment, they can not learn prevention. If adolescents are convinced that AIDS is being used to deprive them of sexual freedom, they may refuse to listen to prevention messages and even counterreact in ways that further endanger their lives,'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. More than 81,000 AIDS cases were reported to the organization as of the end of February, but the actual number of AIDS cases is believed to be twice the reported total. WHO estimates that between 5 million and 10 million people are infected with the virus and that 150,000 new cases of fully developed AIDS will be reported during the coming year. `` If we adopt the conservative estimate then 5 million people are infected today with HIV -LRB- the AIDS virus -RRB-, a cumulative total of 1 million AIDS cases would be expected by 1991,'' he said. `` Thus, the period 1988-91 will likely witness over five times more AIDS cases than have thus far occurred.'' Dr. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pape </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> told the panel the epidemic in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> is shifting dramatically to one of heterosexual transmission. Whereas only 26 percent of the cases reported in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> 1983 were believed to have resulted from heterosexual sex, the number jumped to 64 percent last year. In <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, he said, only 12 percent of the cases reported in 1985 were attributed to likely heterosexual sex, compared to 58 percent last year.

 A spurned lover was sentenced to 12 years in prison for shooting off the tip of his former girlfriend's nose after she ended their relationship early last year. <PERSON> Krikor </PERSON> <PERSON> Chouchanian </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, was taken into custody Monday immediately after <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaffe </PERSON> sentenced him and rejected a motion for bail pending appeal. <PERSON> Chouchanian </PERSON> was convicted last month of the attempted murder of <PERSON> Eiman </PERSON> `` Amy'' <PERSON> Rahal </PERSON>, a 28-year-old bellydancer. The jury also convicted him of the special allegations of use of a firearm and causing great bodily injury. The panel, however, rejected an allegation that the shooting was premeditated, which could have brought a life sentence. During the trial, Miss <PERSON> Rahal </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Chouchanian </PERSON> tried to kill her three times after she broke off their relationship.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Revere </PERSON>'s laryngitis made it hard for him to shout, `` The British are coming.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawes </PERSON> got locked in a men's room during a rest stop. And the rain made slippery manholes treacherous for the patriots' horses. Otherwise, Patriots' Day on Monday was the occasion of a satisfactory re-staging of the 13-mile mission to <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> 213 years ago that alerted revolutionary colonists that British troops were heading their way. `` I'm ready to go back,'' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> said in a cracking voice at the end of the 2 -LCB- - hour horseback ride from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> It was the seventh portrayal of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Revere </PERSON> for the 72-year-old entrepreneur from <LOCATION> Wellesley </LOCATION> who is a brigadier general in the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lancers </ORGANIZATION>. For decades, the ceremonial militia of 30 men has roughly recreated in daytime the horseback ride that <PERSON> Revere </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dawes </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> made in the late hours of April 18, 1775. By alerting the insurrectionary colonists that British troops were on their way to <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, the 18th century trio set in motion the next day's confrontation that started the American Revolution. Monday, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, a lieutenant in the lancers who portrayed <PERSON> Dawes </PERSON>, was freed from a men's room in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> in time to meet up with Snow for their grand finale in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> where they were met by a cheering crowd estimated at 500 people. This year's journey was considerably harder than the one taken the first time around. Just before Snow left <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with a send-off from Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, he groused about the rain. His costume of three-cornered hat, wig, cloak and boots made for a hot ride compared to <PERSON> Revere </PERSON>'s, who had the advantage of a cool, clear night and his own clothes. Snow also had to watch out for slippery manholes. But Snow said he enjoyed himself and was grateful for the audience along the way that ignored the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marathon </LOCATION>. When Snow left <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Revere </PERSON> lived in a house that still stands, a throng of spectators stood under store awnings and a makeshift canopy of umbrellas. There were grinning toddlers, graying baby-boomers taking off for the state holiday and elderly Italian widows. `` This is how <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was founded,'' said <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Gant </PERSON>, an accountant from <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, who recommended historical re-enactments as a way to understand this country. `` You've got to get the concept of where you come from to know where you go from here,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Gant </PERSON>, 50. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Federico </PERSON>, 35, a pharmacist who grew up in the old, narrow streets of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>, said he's been coming to see <PERSON> Revere </PERSON> ride off his entire life. That's why he brought his 10-year-old son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, he said. `` It's a family tradition,'' the elder <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> said with a nod toward his son. `` It's important to see what you read about in the classroom.''

 American Ballet Theater opened its two-month season at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with panache _ the kind of dancing, style and brio that expects, deserves and receives bravos. Monday's program began with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>'s new production and staging of `` Raymonda -LRB- Grand Pas Classique -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Martine </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON>, a commanding stage presence as well as a glorious ballerina, was partnered superbly by <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> McKerrow </PERSON>, who danced the fourth solo variation, which requires lightness, long extension and some difficult balances, has blossomed into the ballerina her early promise predicted. <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> staged the ballet after <PERSON> Marius </PERSON> <PERSON> Petipa </PERSON>, incorporating the grand pas de dix from Act 3 and several variations from the full-length `` Raymonda.'' Music is by <PERSON> Glazounov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> <PERSON> Tudor </PERSON>, who died last year, choreographed `` The Leaves Are Fading'' for American Ballet Theater in 1975. The music is by <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON>. Sometimes this seems merely an overlong, pretty ballet, in which the women's thin skirts ripple as the men lift them and they seem to float. On Monday, it was a beautiful ballet. The various moods were strongly defined. There is much more than a pastel sense of autumn and saying goodby. Exquisite dancing _ which was seen opening night _ is important. Dim lighting instead of very noticeable dappled lighting helps, too, allowing the dancers and the music to hold prominence. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> were the nimble leading couple, their virtuosic dancing having a carefree air about it. The evening ended with the first <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> performance of the company's production of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>'s `` Ballet Imperial.'' The company looks comfortable with this <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> piece, which is more classical than his usual _ he based it on the Petipa style. Also, in this 1941 ballet, there are intertwinings which are <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> trademarks. `` Ballet Imperial'' is as visually regal as the `` Raymonda'' which began the evening and the dancing was as glittering as the women's small crowns. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Stretton </PERSON> were the impressive leading couple and Miss <PERSON> McKerrow </PERSON> distinguished herself again in solos. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boriskin </PERSON> was the thundering soloist in <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s `` Second Piano Concerto'' for `` Ballet Imperial. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Everly </PERSON> conducted the entire evening.

 Employers in areas of low joblessness are increasingly turning to using teen-agers in violation of child labor laws as an alternative to paying higher wages to attract and retain adults, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say. Illegal employment of children increased by more than 50 percent in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. It said the most dramatic increase in violations occurred in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where unemployment rates are lowest. `` Because of the high levels of employment, we're finding a lot of firms hiring minors illegally for positions formerly held by older workers,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, deputy administrator of the department's wage-hour division. `` It's a trend in that geographic region.'' The number of children nationwide that the department found to be illegally employed last year was slightly more than 19,000, up from 12,662 in 1986. The department said it assessed civil fines totaling $ 1.5 million last year against 811 companies illegally employing 10,160 minors. Under the labor protection laws, children ages 14 and 15 can hold limited, non-hazardous jobs, but the number of hours they can work is restricted. Children ages 16 and 17 can work full-time but not in dangerous occupations such as roofing, excavation work and mining or around hazardous machinery. The biggest violator, the department said, was a large chain of supermarkets in the Northeast which was working children too many hours a week and illegally employing them in hazardous occupations such as meat cutting. Ms. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> would not identify the supermarket chain, saying the case is still being litigated. The department said it found that nearly 488,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers were cheated out of $ 126 million last year through employer violations of minimum wage, overtime pay and other provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. At least 155,000 workers were due $ 28.5 million in minimum wage violations and 329,000 employers were underpaid at total of $ 98 million in overtime due them, said Assistant Labor Secretary <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>. Of those amounts, the department recovered about $ 20.2 million in minimum wages for 136,000 of the workers who were underpaid and $ 79.5 million for 293,000 of those not paid overtime. The department also assessed $ 873,430 in civil penalties against farm labor contractors for violations of pay and health and safety standards under the Migrant Worker Protection Act.

 A 28-room mansion built as a wedding gift has gained a reputation of bringing bad luck to those who live there: Three of its residents have faced criminal charges, two have lost their fortunes and one killed himself. The latest owners of <PERSON> Dunnellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> are real estate tycoons <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, who were indicted last week on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and federal tax charges. `` It was n't the happiest home,'' said <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Preferred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, who handled two of the sales of the mansion. `` It seems as if some very wealthy people who lived there lost their fortunes. If the walls could talk ...'' The house sits on 26 acres in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, hometown to such notables as <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. The average price of a home here is about $ 1 million, real estate agents say. It was built in 1918 at a cost of $ 1 million for <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, as a wedding gift for his daughter, <PERSON> Rhea </PERSON>. She married <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Topping, son of <PERSON> John </PERSON> A. Topping, president of Republic Steel. The estate, referred to locally as the `` Topping House,'' was named <PERSON> Dunnellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> by <PERSON> Rhea </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Topping </PERSON> for her mother, <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>. It was sold for the first time in 1950 to <PERSON> Loring </PERSON> <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>, president of S.H. <ORGANIZATION> Pormeroy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a steel fabricating company. But he suffered financial troubles and lost the house in 1963. Others who have had trouble after they moved into the house were: _ <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> policeman who was married to <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON>, a heiress to the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> automobile fortune <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> shot and killed a busboy who apparently was trying to climb into the bedroom window of their <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> home in 1968. The slaying was ruled justifiable homicide. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> killed himself in 1977, although a judge would not say whether the shooting was intentional or accidental. _ Investor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> He was indicted by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> grand jury on 46 counts of grand larceny and forgery for allegedly stealing $ 840,000 through the use of false documents to obtain a loan. He pleaded innocent in 1971. The case was pending when he died suddenly in 1974 at the age of 46 while being driven to the estate by his chauffeur. _ <PERSON> Ravi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikkoo </PERSON>, owner of the one of the world's largest oil supertankers He lost the bulk of his fortune during the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil embargo and petroleum shortages in the mid-1970s. The <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's wealthiest couples at an estimated $ 1.4 billion and with a stake in the Empire State Building, bought the estate in 1983 for $ 11 million. The Helmsleys pleaded innocent last week to charges in a 188-count <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state tax evasion indictment. They are accused by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officials of avoiding taxes by claiming about $ 4 million in renovations to <LOCATION> Dunnellen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> as business expenses at their hotels. The couple also face a 47-count federal indictment on similar charges. <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Parizek </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that two auditors had been assigned to examine the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' finances. Last week, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannon </PERSON>, state commisioner of revenue services, said his investigators were taking a close look at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> charges to determine if any <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> taxes were owed on items at the estate. One of the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s attorneys, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, said Monday that he thought the couple would not fall victim to the curse. `` I'm sure the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s have broken the bad luck streak at <LOCATION> Dunnnellen </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which handled the sale of the estate for <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, widow of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, said the property had been compared to a famous gem with a bad reputation. `` She -LRB- <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> -RRB- said this place is like the Hope Diamond _ everyone who ever owned it and lived here had bad luck,'' <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said Monday. `` I argued with <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> at the time, but I would n't argue with her today.'' According to the book `` Diamonds Eternal,'' by <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Argenzio </PERSON>, the gem was owned by <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON>, who went to guillotine with his wife. A Dutch cutter who changed the stone's appearance had the stone stolen from him by his own son who later killed himself. Turkish sultan <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, lost his throne and had to abdicate shortly after aquiring stone in 1908, the book said. Later, after <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evalyn </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> acquired the stone, their first son was killed in an auto crash, and <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> was implicated in the Teapot Dome scandal and died in mental institution. After Mrs. <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>'s death in 1947, the diamond was purchased by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON>, who gave it to the current owner, the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Conservationists Cite Report on National Forest Timbering Losses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A congressional study is giving fresh ammunition to conservationists and lawmakers who want to end the big-bucks losses sustained by taxpayers from timber sales in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest national forest. Weighing in on the side of the sales program's critics, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should scrap the 1980 law requiring the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to market a minimum amount of timber from <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative wing of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said in a study released Monday that the requirement cost the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> $ 22.1 million in 1986 and has not created the lumbering jobs it was supposed to in southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The 1980 law directs the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to offer to sell at least 4.5 billion board feet of Tongass timber each decade and guarantees at least $ 40 million in spending a year to support the sales program. The law resulted from a compromise worked out by conservationists and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> lawmakers. In return for the guarantee program, conservationists would get 5.4 million of the forest's 16.8 million acres declared wilderness, putting them off-limits to commercial use The Tongass is the only national forest with a minimum sales goal set by law, although Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, has proposed a similar guarantee for the <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in his state. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation to repeal the Tongass guarantee. A similar bill is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The proposals are being pushed by environmental and conservation groups who say the guarantee leads to lost tax dollars, unnecessary roadbuilding by the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and needless harvesting of 400-year-old trees. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study, requested by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said sales of Tongass timber should be subject to market supply-and-demand forces <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that from 1981 through 1986, sales of Tongass timber averaged 245 million board feet a year, some 205 million below the yearly average needed to meet the 10-year goal. Focusing on 1986, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 47.9 million on the <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> and realized only $ 3.3 million in revenues. The net loss was $ 22.1 million because some spending was for timber production in future years, according to the study. From 1981 through 1986, $ 131 million was spent to prepare for timber sales that were not needed to meet existing demand, the study said. `` The timber supply provision should be revised so that the amount supplied would be based on the anticipated demand for timber and on the data currently being formulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ... rather than on a rigid per-decade requirement,'' the study said. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said Tongass-related timber jobs declined from 2,700 in 1980 to 1,420 in 1986 `` primarily because of the decreased harvest levels resulting from declining demand for timber and increased production by the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> native corporations that directly compete with the Tongass timber industry.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> that the proposal to scrap the <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> guarantee `` has merit.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said in a prepared statement that <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> focused on a low-demand portion of an economic cycle and that timber has since rebounded. He said money must be spent on the <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> even in slack periods in order to meet peak demand. He also said the study is flawed because it focused only on the guarantee, not on the other side of the 1980 compromise: prohibiting commercial activities in nearly one-third of the Tongass.

 Knocking down barriers to trade among the 12 countries of the European Community by 1992 will also benefit outside countries such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a researcher says. The main advantage to outside trading partners from greater unification would be in having only a single set of rules to deal with, instead of a dozen, said <PERSON> Paolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecchini </PERSON>, assigned by the Community to study the issue. `` A foreign company that sells to only one of the 12 will have jumped over the culture gap,'' he said Monday. <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Krucoff </PERSON>, press officer for the Community's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, gave labeling requirements on European imports as an example. Now each of the 12 governments has its own rules. <PERSON> Cecchini </PERSON> added that since there would be no official discrimination against subsidiaries of foreign firms within the Community, they too would benefit from any additional growth. <PERSON> Cecchini </PERSON> said that over the `` medium term'' _ about five years _ new measures of unification also could create as many as 5 million new jobs in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where unemployment is higher than in this country.. He said about 200 people have contributed to his project called `` The Cost of Non-Europe'' _ the cost of not having unified the economy of the Community yet. In addition to <PERSON> Cecchini </PERSON>'s own <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, members include <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Together, these countries have as many people as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> has also asked to join, and Community officials say <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> are possibilities. The European Common Market program is conducted under the auspices of the Community. <PERSON> Cecchini </PERSON> noted that in some matters the Community already has more unity than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. For example, a doctor licensed in one of the 12 countries is qualified to practice in all of them, unlike the rules here which differ from state to state. Next month <PERSON> Cecchini </PERSON> will start publishing more than 6,000 pages of research. He said his study has found that European economic gains from greater unification could be worth more than $ 300 billion and prices paid by consumers could be 6 percent less than in a divided continent. `` Five million new jobs would cover half of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s unemployed, or all the young unemployed,'' he added. He also cited the example of Japanese auto exporters, whose sales to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> are limited under a quota imposed by the Italian government. The effort is now being made to `` Europeanize'' this quota, so that Japanese sales could go to any of the 12 countries on the same terms. Community officials emphasized there would have to be some hard bargaining with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> first. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Calingaert </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official on leave to study the European effort for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a private group. He said the European plans are moving ahead fast. `` In 1957 industrialists were frightened of the possible results and opposed it,'' he said. `` Now they are in favor.'' He said the private sector is acting as if the effort will succeed, and that attitude could be self-fulfilling. The idea of a unified <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which dates back centuries, got a boost after World War II when Americans held up the economic advantages of a `` common market'' like that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. West European countries had to organize themselves to distribute the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid offered in the Marshall Plan, and began to eliminate import quotas in trade with one another. In 1957 six of the present 12 members signed the Treaty of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, pledging the removal of all barriers among them. Progress has been slow. `` Now things are accelerating,'' <PERSON> Cecchini </PERSON> said. `` Six months ago nobody was even talking about a central bank for the Community. Now the prospect is that the summit meeting in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- in June will set up a study of something like the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Federal Reserve system.''

 The disappearance of a leading nuclear scientist has Taiwanese fuming at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and worrying about damage to their national security. Newspapers carried unconfirmed reports after Col. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsien-yi </PERSON> vanished in mid-January that he worked for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and might have turned over nuclear secrets to the Americans. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> was a deputy director of the official <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. He disappeared while on leave from his post. `` We immediately looked at this map, maybe he fell off a cliff,'' said <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuang-chi </PERSON>, secretary general of the government <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, as he moved to an office wall map of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and traced a route along rugged interior roads. But several local newspapers provided a different scenario for <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>'s disappearance, reporting that he was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> informant who left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with details about a Taiwanese nuclear weapons program. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last month that the department had no comment on whether <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> was an informant for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests here, has told the government and local media the institute has no idea of what happened to <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> officials have repeatedly denied plans to build a nuclear bomb. Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said the production of atomic weapons by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> would be reason to invade the island, which <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> regards as a renegade province. Nevertheless, the uproar over <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> has increased anti-American sentiment that already was brewing here because of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s tough trade talk with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, which last year had a record $ 16 billion trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1979 broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and recognized the Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> government, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> remains the island's major trade partner and arms supplier. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> serves as an operative diplomatic and commercial link in the absence of an embassy. `` I get a lot of hot reaction from my students,'' said <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> who also teaches at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chengchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Until this point there's always been a huge reservoir of good will toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... but I think the reservoir has cracked.'' The <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> media, which has given intense coverage to <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>'s disappearance, also has criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> A March 25 commentary in the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said that no matter what the motive, `` the act of stealing our defense secrets has invaded our national sovereignty and respect to a certain degree. ... No one can interpret this as friendly behavior.'' <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> officials now believe <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. They have asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for information about him but the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration claims it does not know his whereabouts. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> recently said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> can not lodge a protest with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because `` we do n't have evidence showing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government or <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> involvement.'' But Jaw Shau-kong, a maverick lawmaker from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is demanding retaliatory action. The government `` probably should expel some -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- diplomats from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, expel some <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>; it can not keep silent,'' said <PERSON> Jaw </PERSON>, who views the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as an imperialist nation. <PERSON> Jaw </PERSON> said he fears <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> took important military secrets, possibly classified information about <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s missile development program. Jaw added that he wonders if such material could fall into the hands of Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, the nuclear energy official, noted that many of <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>'s classmates worked on missile and airplane projects at the military-run <ORGANIZATION> Chungshan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> The government maintains, however, <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> did not take any sensitive information from <LOCATION> Chungshan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> believes the missing scientist did not have access to such secrets even though he knew of work done by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> staff for military-related Chungshan projects. Professor <PERSON> Su </PERSON> believes <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>'s disappearance is unlikely to cause a serious re-evaluation of Taiwanese-U.S. relations but could eventually lead to public debate of the country's nuclear policy. In early April, the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> newspaper published a poll that indicated <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> was split over the development of nuclear weapons. According to the survey, 35 percent of the 767 people polled by telephone said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> should make atomic bombs while 34 percent were against such a policy. The poll, with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, indicated most people believe <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is capable of making the weapons. Nearly three-fourths of the respondents said that if <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> developed nuclear weapons they should not be used against mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 Critics of the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range missiles should be satisfied with Soviet assurances the pact covers both existing missiles and future weapons using exotic technologies, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told the committee on Monday that the Soviet position was spelled out last week in a conversation between Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. The dispute centers on the treaty signed Dec. 8 by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, eliminating nuclear missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said the treaty banned both existing missiles and any `` futuristic'' weapons, such as those using lasers or beam rays, as long as the weapons had a range covered by the treaty. But critics, including members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, questioned whether the Soviets might have a different view of the treaty and suggested that the ambiguity should be cleared up. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s `` unequivocal statement should allay concerns that have been raised about this subject.'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>'s committee sent the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a report Monday that said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should approve the treaty and protect its constitutional rights by blocking presidential attempts to change the way treaties are interpreted. The 515-page report sums up the panel's three months of hearings and its votes on the historic pact. The report was approved by the same 17-2 majority which recommended two weeks ago that the treaty should be ratified by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition votes were cast by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, R-S. Ratification requires a vote of 67 of the 100 senators. Leaders of both parties estimate that 90 or more senators will support the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty when it finally comes to a vote. Publication of the committee report means the way is finally clear for formal consideration on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. Republicans say the most contentious issue will likely be the Democratic-backed amendment that would bar the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from changing the interpretation of the INF treaty. The amendment, approved 12-7 by the committee, arises from a fight over the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has asserted that the White House can unilaterally change how the ABM pact is viewed, a move that would permit expanded `` Star Wars'' testing, but congressional Democrats dispute that claim. `` A presidential right to adopt a different interpretation of a treaty, irrespective of the understanding on which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> based its consent, would tend to nullify the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the treaty power and thus undermine a basic provision of the Constitution,'' the report said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s only recourse, to prevent its share of the treaty power being nullified, would be to attach elaborate and numerous conditions to treaties in order to have the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s understanding become an integral and explicit part of the ratification documents,'' the report said. `` Such procedures could easily overburden the treaty process to the point of paralysis,'' it warned.

 The nation's community colleges meet ambivalence about their role and often `` receive the state's budget leftovers'' when they can be of great help both to their neighborhoods and the nation, an educational commission said today. `` The community college, at its best, can be a center for problem-solving in adult illiteracy or the education of the disabled,'' said a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Future of Community Colleges. `` It can also be the place where education and business leaders meet to talk about the problems of displaced workers. `` It can bring together agencies to strengthen services for minorities, working women, single parent heads of households and unwed teenage parents. ... The community college can take the lead in long-range planning for community development and it can serve as the focal point for improving the quality of life in the inner city.'' Community colleges enroll 43 percent of the nation's undergraduates and 51 percent of all first-time freshmen, but the schools `` encounter ambivalence in the larger community about their role and mission, and competing priorities within the college,'' the report said Such schools `` are threatened by excessive fragmentation and division'' and increasing cultural separations and racial tensions, the report said. `` We propose therefore, that the theme ` Building Communities' become the new rallying point for the community college in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> We define the term ` community' not only as a region to be served but also as a climate to be created.'' The commission was headed by <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commissioner of education and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Teaching. It conducted the study for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and Junior Colleges. The panel said community colleges must help solve the dropout problem or minority students will continue to leave. It recommended that every college develop an aggressive outreach plan for disadvantaged students. Among other recommendations: _ An `` early warning system'' to spot and help students who are at risk of dropping out. _ Each community college should commit itself to recruiting and retaining a top-quality faculty and increase the percentage of members who are black, Hispanic and Asian. _ Careful assessment of reading, writing and mathematical ability of all first-time community college students and an intensive developmental education program for those who need it _ Completion of a core curriculum by all associate degree students

<HEAD>Judge Debates Whether Flawed Ban Is Better Than No Ban At All</HEAD>

 A federal judge says he must decide whether to approve a flawed consent decree regulating all-terrain vehicles or do nothing to regulate the vehicles blamed for 900 deaths in five years. `` Is it best to move in the direction of doing what one can do to reduce it as opposed to doing nothing about it?'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said after a hearing on a proposed out-of-court settlement between the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and five manufacturers. Opponents of the consent decree argued at Monday's hearing that the agreement between federal regulators and manufacturers is flawed because it does n't provide for refunds to people who purchased the vehicles, popularly known as ATVs. Lawyers for consumer groups and 32 states said the consent decree also fails to protect children from the hazards of the four-wheel machines, particularly smaller models marketed for children, which would still be sold. `` We do n't believe these child-sized ATVs should be sold at all,'' said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, who called ATVs `` some of the most dangerous consumer products sold in this country.'' The decree would ban future sales of three-wheel ATVs unless the manufacturers devised performance standards that would be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION>. It would also require warning labels on four-wheel models and distributors would have to offer training about the safe use of the machines to owners of vehicles currently in use. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> appeared troubled by the decree's ban on further action by the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> against ATVs during the 10-year period the agreement is in effect. `` The mechanism provided by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is stymied by the consent decree,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> told a lawyer for the manufacturers. `` As I understand the decree, the agency represented here _ <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> _ is not able to issue a rule under the statute which would be in many respects more severe'' than the sanctions imposed by the consent decree, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` You take the agency out of the game, you ca n't tell me with quite the same assurance the agency is going to continue to perform its function,'' the judge said. Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who is sponsoring legislation to force manufacturers to give refunds, called that provision `` a wolf in sheep's clothing.'' The senator urged <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to modify the decree to give the agency the option of taking further action after a year or 18 months if the agreement has not led to safer use of ATVs. But <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said the agreement allows the government to avoid a lengthy court battle during which it would be difficult to prove the allegations that the ATVs are an `` imminent hazard'' as defined by the consumer protection statute. `` This is an outstanding resolution of the matter in light of the facts as they exist and the law as it exists,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. `` The government will get some of what it asked for, the other alternative is the government will get none of what it asked for.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> also expressed concern about the mechanics for supervising the decree's enforcement, saying he was particularly dismayed that it empowered the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel to extend deadlines. Nevertheless, the judge said the unprecedented decree could be `` a technique that could be of great value to consumers.''

<HEAD>Bill Passes to Ban Common Barnacle Blocker</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has some bad news for boat owners who hate to scrape barnacles off the hull. The chamber gave voice-vote approval Monday to legislation to regulate the use of tributyltin, or <ORGANIZATION> TBT </ORGANIZATION>, a hull paint additive that is effective against barnacles but poses dangers to other marine life. The bill would ban the use of paints containing <ORGANIZATION> TBT </ORGANIZATION> on vessels under 82 feet in length and would impose limits on the amount of <ORGANIZATION> TBT </ORGANIZATION> that can be released into the water from hull paint on larger vessels. The restrictions would last until the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> decides on an environmentally safe release rate for paints containing <ORGANIZATION> TBT </ORGANIZATION>, which have been regulated by <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> because of damage to shellfish. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> TBT </ORGANIZATION> `` is without a doubt the most effective anti-fouling compound yet developed, and it can not be matched for preventing the attachment of barnacles, algae and other marine organisms that hasten the decay of wood and cause drag on boats. `` On the other hand, there is growing evidence that <ORGANIZATION> TBT </ORGANIZATION> is extremely toxic and is affecting ` non-target' marine and freshwater organisms rather than just organisms that are trying to grow on boat hulls.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> TBT </ORGANIZATION> produces toxic effects in some marine organisms at exposures of less than 100 parts per trillion _ `` the equivalent to one drop of water in 100,000 tanker trucks of liquid.'' <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> TBT </ORGANIZATION>'s effects on humans are not known, although high levels of the substance have been found in some chinook salmon by federal researchers. The regulatory legislation originated in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which now will be asked to consider an amendment approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Scallops Make New Bedford Nation's Richest Fish Port</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, was the nation's richest fishing port last year thanks to a banner year for scallops, government and industry officials say. Other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> fishing cities slumped because of a decrease in fin fish such as cod and haddock, and some ports around the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> suffered from problems in the shrimp industry, analysts said Monday. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> led in 1987 with catches valued at $ 143.7 million, up nearly 36 percent from $ 106 million in 1986, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The 1987 figure was a record, the agency said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Weddig </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association, attributed <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION>'s big increase to strong scallop harvests and scallop price increases. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> said scallops accounted for nearly half of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION>'s total dollar value, but made up only 21 percent of the port's catch in weight Alaskan ports also enjoyed a profitable year. <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> was second to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> with catches valued at $ 132.1 million, up from $ 89.8 million, and <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbor-Unalaska </ORGANIZATION> was up from $ 37.2 million to $ 62.7 million, <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Weddig </PERSON> said the healthy <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> industry was due to strong salmon and crab harvests and a sharp increase in exports due to the fall of the dollar overseas. Nationwide, foreign sales in 1987 were more than $ 2 billion, up from $ 1.6 billion the previous year, according to <PERSON> Weddig </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> ports suffered from falling shrimp production and prices, he said. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, led the nation for the 10th consecutive year in the amount of fish caught, <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> landings rose from 616.8 million pounds to 672.4 million pounds, bringing it nearly back to its 1985 level. The record was 848.2 million pounds landed in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1960. <LOCATION> Pascagoula-Moss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, was second at 391.6 million pounds, up from 365.5 million pounds. More than two-thirds of the major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishing ports were up in volume from last year, but nearly half had value decreases. While <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> enjoyed a robust year, most of the other major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> fishing ports suffered declines in both volume and value, according to the <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> report. Down in both categories were <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, Point <PERSON> Judith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Only <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, showed increases, largely because of the operation of the new <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Weddig </PERSON> said. He said decreases in cod, haddock and flounder, as well as the emergence of the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> exchange, led to the decline in landings at the other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> ports.

<HEAD>Trade Lawmakers Deadlock Over Foreign Investment Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers are nearing final action on a sweeping, 1,000-page trade bill, still uncertain if it will contain a plan to force public disclosure by foreign investors of their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holdings. `` If you're interested in passing a trade bill, which I am, then I think the best course of action is to drop the <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> amendment,'' Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., said Monday after lawmakers failed to break a deadlock over the issue A House-Senate panel has been stalemated for more than a month over the amendment sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, which would require public disclosure of much foreign investment within the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> states. <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> said that dropping the plan would reduce the chance of a presidential veto, or if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoes the bill anyway, increase the chance of an override. He noted there already are presidential veto threats over a separate provision that would require 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. The foreign ownership dispute is the last unresolved controversy in fashioning the trade bill, which <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said could come to the floor as early as Wednesday. Most of the compromise provisions were drawn up by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees before the congressional recess Easter week but they left farm items, the plant closings feature and the foreign disclosure plan until the last minute. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters he was pushing for inclusion of the <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> provision. But he added he would not seek to attach the measure to the trade bill if it would `` put its life in jeopardy.'' The speaker said that if conferees would not accept the plan `` I would be inclined to give <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> a run on its own merits'' by bringing it to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor later as a separate bill. Under the plan, foreign investors would be required to register with the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> if they owned 5 percent or more of any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> company or real estate in this country if such assets were worth at least $ 5 million. Some of this information already must be filed with the department but is not public record. That would change under <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>'s plan. Companies with a 25 percent share in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business or property with assets or annual sales of more than $ 20 million would have to disclose much of the detailed information required of corporations by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on its 10-K form. The items range from a list of directors and officers to a financial balance sheet. Critics say the measure would reduce new capital from overseas that helps prime the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic pump; proponents say it would put a spotlight on foreign investment that could be harmful to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests. Most lawmakers believe the trade bill itself will clear both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> without much difficulty. The question is whether it will get the two-thirds support it would need for a veto override. Three major petroleum industry associations called on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign the bill because it would repeal the windfall profits tax on oil companies. `` We can not allow the stagnation of domestic oil exploration and production to continue,'' the groups said in a letter. The letter was sent by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Midcontinent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

 One of the officials who oversee the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says the near doubling of the fund's deficit did not threaten depositors' money in the country's 3,126 federally insured savings and loans `` No one has ever lost a dime in an insured deposit and no one ever will lose a dime,'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said Monday. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has spoken to that.'' The board oversees the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L deposit insurance fund, which insures deposits up to $ 100,000. Bank board officials said the estimated costs of closing or merging ailing S & amp; Ls totaled $ 11.6 billion more than the fund's assets at the end of 1987 That figure compares with a deficit of $ 6.3 billion at the end of 1986. Bank board officials conceded that even this sharply higher figure was disputed by congressional auditors, who contend it is too low. The deficit figure underscores the problems facing the S & amp; L industry, where hundreds of institutions are insolvent but are kept open because the government can not afford to close them and pay off depositors. The new report estimated it will cost $ 15.3 billion to close or sell 204 savings and loans which are considered to be in the worst shape. When $ 3.7 billion in fund assets are subtracted from the $ 15.3 billion in expected liabilities, <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> is left with an estimated deficit of $ 11.6 billion. However, the figure of 204 insolvent S & amp; Ls represents only the worst financial cases. Another 306 institutions were also insolvent at the end of the year under generally accepted accounting principles. The <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> report estimated that if all of these institutions had to be rescued, it would add another $ 6.5 billion to the amount of money the insurance fund will be obligated to pay out. White defended the $ 6.5 billion estimate, saying not all of the additional S & amp; Ls will actually need assistance and the institutions representing the biggest drain on the funds had already been included in the first group of 204 S & amp; Ls. However, critics contend that a figure of around $ 30 billion is a much more reasonable estimate and that the costs could climb as high as $ 60 billion for solving the industry's problems, far above the amount approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year. In August, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislatio to pump $ 10.8 billion into <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> over the next three years through the sale of bonds which will be paid off by a special assessment on profitable institutions. There have been reports that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is beginning to study alternative methods of financing because of the threat the soaring <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> deficit poses to efforts to reduce the overall federal budget deficit. The ideas being considered reportedly range from merging <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> with the healthy <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures funds at banks, or tapping into the money generated each year by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, popularly known as <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> created in 1970 to funnel money from investors to home buyers. <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brendsel </PERSON> said that diverting his company's income stream to assist <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> `` is an idea that does n't stand up to financial scrutiny. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said it was premature to consider major changes to get more money for <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. He said that the S & amp; L fund will have $ 20 billion at its disposal over the next three years and that this amount would be sufficient to deal with the worst problems facing the industry. He said the new president would have plenty of time to study what further resources would be needed.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a business group he favors continued research on the Star Wars missile defense system and then told an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> audience a few hours later: `` We do not need Star Wars. We need decent housing and education and day care.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Borosage </PERSON>, a top adviser to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, said the former civil rights activist has always supported research on Star Wars. But it was not until the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary campaign that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> began to readily discuss his support for that research. `` Keep the research; we do n't need to deploy it,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the Association for a <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of business and civic leaders, a few hours before his East Harlem appearance. An even more publicized shift in position was <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s statement that he would not meet with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> Ten years ago, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> embraced <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> at a meeting that became a focus of Jewish opposition to his candidacy. During an interview on the CBS show, `` Face the Nation,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was an `` extreme element'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and that it would be a mistake to negotiate with him. On the same program, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he had no plans to scrap existing weapons in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenal, including many he opposed in the past. Is <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> shifting toward the mainstream as he has become a credible challenger to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' claim on the Democratic presidential nomination? <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a top <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser, called the shifts part of a `` two-way evolution.'' She said that as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been taken more seriously as a presidential candidate he has been asked more substantive policy questions and they have forced him to re-examine many of his views. `` His position on <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> has been the same since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> launched it,'' said <PERSON> Borosage </PERSON>. But he conceded the candidate's stance on any <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> role in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> negotiations has changed `` He believes you've got to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Borosage </PERSON>. But, he added, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also has come to believe that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is too `` inciteful'' to be included in peace negotiations. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has explained his earlier meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> as an effort to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader to accept <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. He repeatedly told <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> audiences that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must be guaranteed secure borders. He also has advocated an independent Palestinian state. In the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> interview, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also denied having advocated elimination of such systems as the MX missile. `` We've got to keep the systems we have,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In a letter published in Monday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Borosage </PERSON> took issue with a story on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s views that had appeared in the newspaper. `` Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has never stated he ` would scrap a range of weapons systems' already deployed,'' wrote <PERSON> Borosage </PERSON>. However he went on to say that the candidate would oppose further development of the Stealth bomber `` because we have just spent billions purchasing the B-1 for the same mission.'' In speeches, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> advocates a freeze in the military budget.

 Here are highlights from the report by the President's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Aviation Safety: _ The nation's air transportation system is `` safe, for now,'' but the government regulatory structure `` designed to ensure aviation safety is inadequate to deal with future growth and technological change.'' _ A `` major structural overhaul'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is needed, making it an independent agency outside the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. _ An independent aviation `` safety czar'' should be appointed as part of the new <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and given authority to oversee safety matters. With a seven-year term, the new aviation safety director could initiate new safety rules and block proposed regulations. _ No need has been demonstrated for re-imposing federal regulation of the airline industry, although the government must streamline its regulatory activities to deal with rapidly changing events in a deregulated industry. _ Surveillance of airlines should be improved with heavier reliance on in-depth inspections, surprise inspections and closer examination of airlines undergoing major changes. _ Safety requirements for commuter airlines should elevated gradually to the same level as those for larger commercial airlines. _ Small private planes flying near major airports should be required to have equipment that informs ground controllers of their altitude.

<HEAD>Farm Prices Rise, But Farm Share Of Retail Food Prices Drops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farm prices of food commodities averaged higher in 1987 after declining for two years, and retail grocery prices rose even faster, says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. So, for the third straight year farmers got a declining share of the consumer food dollar _ an average of 29 percent, or 29 cents out of every dollar spent at grocery stores for a market-basket list of food items. The farm value share of the retail price of food in the market basket has declined at least one percentage point each year _ a penny of each dollar spent _ since it averaged 34 percent, or 34 cents, in the 1984 calendar year. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> records going back to 1913, when farmers got 46 percent of the food dollar, the annual share has been at record low levels the last three years _ 31 percent in 1985, 30 percent in 1986 and 29 percent in 1987. Previously, the low mark was a farm value share of 32 percent during 1932 and 1933 in the depths of the Depression. It rose to more than 50 percent during World War II and for a few years after. With 29 percent of the retail cost of market basket going to farmers, that means the remaining 71 percent went to those who handle raw food products after they leave the farm. The market basket contains average quantities of domestically produced food bought in grocery stores, excluding non-alcoholic beverages, and fish and seafood. Department economists use several basic components to describe what happens to the market basket each year: _ Farm value represents prices farmers receive for the raw commodities equivalent to foods in the market basket _ The farm-to-retail price spread is the difference between the retail price and the farm value The price spread is the charge for processing, distributing and retailing foods. _ The farm value share is the proportion the farmer gets from the amount consumers spend on market-basket food sold in grocery stores In 1987, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in its annual report, the farm value of food increased 2.7 percent. But the retail store price of the market basket rose 5 percent, and the price spread increased 6 percent. That caused the farm value share to decline again _ to the record low of 29 percent. While useful as an indicator to track where consumer food dollars go, the market basket does not tell the overall story. For example, the agency said that food prices overall _ including all items eaten at home and away from home _ rose an average of 4.1 percent in 1987, compared with 3.2 percent in 1986. That was the sharpest annual increase since 1981, and included a 4.3 percent gain for grocery prices and 4 percent for food eaten away from home. `` Food prices rose more at supermarkets and other grocery stores than at eating places for the first time in nine years,'' the report said. Looking further at the market basket, economists said the farm share declined to 29 percent `` because abundant food supplies held down farm prices while rising food processing and distributing charges'' forced up prices at retail stores. `` The size of the farm value share is not a direct measure of the welfare of producers, but a shortrun decrease often accompanies a decline in farm income,'' the report said. `` Last year, net farm income increased, but mainly because of higher government payments.''

 An additional 175,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat has been sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at subsidized prices under an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> export program. The sale, equal to about 6.42 million bushels, was handled by <ORGANIZATION> Artfer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 100,000 tons; and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 75,000. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday the grain was sold under terms of the long-term grain agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the subsidies averaged $ 24.46 per ton, or about 67 cents per bushel of wheat. No selling prices were announced, but wheat has been averaging about $ 2.85 per bushel recently, according to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. That could mean a farm value of about $ 18 million. The pact, which expires Sept. 30, calls on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to buy at least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that the purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. So far, the Soviets have bought more than 8.6 million tons of subsidized wheat for delivery in the fifth year, as well as 4.1 million tons of non-subsidized corn; 818,400 tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans; and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal. Subsidies are provided under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. Private exporters are given surplus commodities owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> so they can sell a foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodities at competitive world prices. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the Soviets have only 10,200 tons remaining in their current <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> authorization, which was announced on April 4.

 Sheep producers will soon receive about $ 90 million in federal price support payments for wool marketed in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. The payments are adjusted to help make up the difference between the announced support of $ 1.81 per pound of 1987 wool and the average market price, which was 91.7 cents per pound. Mohair payments to goat producers will total about $ 40 million, reflecting a 1987 support of $ 4.95 per pound and a 1987 average market price of $ 2.63 per pound, officials said Monday.

 Presidential hopeful <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> headed into today's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary with a new win in his column _ in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s Democratic caucuses, where he handily beat rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. With all 41 precincts reporting, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 86.5 delegates for 45 percent, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 51.5 delegates for 27 percent and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had four delegates for 2 percent. Forty-seven delegates were uncommitted for 25 percent. The delegates selected will attend the state convention May 23, where <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s 15 national convention delegates will be chosen. Based on the results, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> picked up seven delegates, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> five and three are uncommitted. The <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> caucuses were overshadowed by today's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> contest, with its primary prize of 255 delegates. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had been organized statewide in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> for several months, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opened shop about three weeks ago. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has no organization in the state. Before the caucuses, there had been predictions that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters would turn out in force. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>, the state party chairman, predicted a heavy turnout, spurred by a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> organizing drive. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> coordinator <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters in the state were `` fervent and committed.'' Caucuses were being held in 41 state representative districts to select 189 delegates to the state convention. Candidates had to win at least 15 percent of the vote to receive a share of the delegates. Party leaders have stayed neutral since favorite son Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> dropped out of the race in September. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> called it quits in a campaign rocked by charges he plagiarized in law school, plagiarized speeches and exaggerated his academic credentials.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study strongly endorses Canadian electricity imports as a cheap alternative to <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> oil and rejects a proposal from the domestic coal industry to limit the hydroelectric power. The report, released Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>, dismisses arguments that Canadian producers have unfair advantages over domestic utilities. It also dismisses assertions that reliance on Canadian imports could leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> vulnerable, and that government subsidies and lower environmental standards make the exports possible. Instead, it says, Canadian utilities can export hydroelectric power at a cheaper price than it costs to build new coal facilities because of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s vast water resources. `` Arguments about Canadian subsidies, lax environmental standards and national security implications are not only often factually wrong, but also divert attention from the real public policy issue,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, executive director of the center and co-author of the study. `` If <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has greater access to inexpensive natural resources, should the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal government limit the ability of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers to purchase those resources?'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> asked. The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> researchers estimated that the 35,300 gigawatt hours of Canadian electricity purchased by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986 would increase by 1995 to between 52,000 and 63,000 gigawatt hours. A gigawatt is a billion watts. Canadian power imports represent only 2 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption nationwide, but they account for about 10 percent of the electricity used in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The $ 75,000 study was paid in large part by utilities that benefit from Canadian imports. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said buying large chunks of Canadian power does not pose a national security risk since it is unlikely <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would cut off electricity for political reasons. `` The security costs of any practically attainable level of Canadian imports are far outweighed by the national security benefits which accrue to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from reducing oil imports'' from <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> nations, the report said. Rep. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, countered, `` Political relationships are volatile with changes in leadership, and in no way can we use today's stable relationship -LRB- with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> -RRB- as a basis for the future <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on mining and natural resources, introduced legislation last year that would prohibit Canadian power imports unless they adhered to environmental safeguards similar to those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The study also said that Canadian imports displace mostly imported oil and domestic natural gas, not coal. If all Canadian power contracts were canceled, the coal industry would see a 2,479 increase in jobs, but it would cost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers $ 114,123 per job, the study said.

 The government and rebel leaders adjourned peace talks Monday without reaching agreement after four days, but they agreed to meet again in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> at the end of the month. Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the defense minister and head of the Sandinista government's negotiating team, read a statement signed by both parties saying they would meet in the capital April 28-30 to continue talks on a permanent truce in the 6 -LCB- - year-old war <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a leader of the rebels known as Contras, told reporters the two sides were `` on the road to an understanding.'' He refused to elaborate on what they discussed during the talks. `` This is n't an automobile race in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> to run at 200 miles per hour,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` Our interest is to negotiate the definitive cease-fire, but it ca n't be reached overnight, for which we consider that what was discussed here was an advance and not a failure.'' He claimed the rebels' political directorate was being pressured to avoid signing an agreement by the Contra military chief, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>. `` Our army will continue clutching their rifles to dissuade the enemies of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, and I'm referring to <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> and the guerrillas, so that they do n't continue sabotaging the accords,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> is the town where the two sides signed a cease-fire agreement last month. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the defense minister's brother, told a rally Monday night that the Contra political leaders should not cave in to what he said was pressure from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>. Addressing thousands of Sandinista supporters in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolucion </ORGANIZATION>, the president claimed <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> had told <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> political leaders that if they signed a truce with the government the rebels `` would liquidate them.'' He said if the political leaders submit `` to the pressures of the <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> administration and the threats of <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, they would not continue to come to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and if they did it would be to break the Sapoa accords. `` If this happens, it would leave us no other road but to achieve a total victory in the military field.'' Negotiations between the rebels and government have been deadlocked over the so-called `` democratization'' issue. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have insisted the rebels sign a permanent truce immediately. They say Contra delegates would then be allowed to take part in a `` national reconciliation dialogue'' with leaders of the country's 14 legally recognized political parties. Contra leaders are demanding that Sandinistas first carry out a series of democratic reforms, or at least pledge to do so. On Monday afternoon, <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> told a cheering crowd the rebels will press for an end to the military draft and the release of thousands of political prisoners. `` We are in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to negotiate with the Sandinistas the freedom of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the restoration of democracy and, as long as we do not achieve this, we will not lay down our weapons,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> told about 800 supporters in the capital. He spoke outside La Prensa before he and other Contra leaders visited the editors of the only opposition newspaper. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> and five directors of the rebel umbrella group, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, traveled to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Friday to try to negotiate with the government an end to the war that has killed an estimated 26,500 people. It was the first time the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> agreed to negotiate with their foes in the capital. The Contras' 20-minute visit to <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> was their first venture outside the Camino Real Hotel where they have been staying. Contra leaders visited with Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo and other Roman Catholic church officials in the afternoon and said afterward they would free 40 government soldiers. `` At the request of the bishops we have decided to free the Sandinista prisoners that we have in our power as a show of good faith for national reconciliation,'' said <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, highest-ranking official in the Contra directorate. Official <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> radio claimed the Contras had more Sandinista prisoners and releasing only 40 was `` ridiculous in seven years of war.'' The two sides signed a peace agreement March 23 which provided for a temporary cease-fire while they negotiated a permanent truce. The 60-day cease-fire went into effect April 1. The Contras on Monday proposed that the temporary cease-fire be extended another month while both sides seek agreement. There was no immediate response from the government. Soon after the March 23 accord was signed, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> freed 100 of the 3,300 political prisoners and promised to release the rest as peace negotiations progressed. Among the Contra directors who visited <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> Monday was <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, whose mother, <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, is publisher. His publisher father, also named <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, was killed on Jan. 10, 1978. The assassination, widely blamed on the right-wing government in power at the time, unleashed a revolt that toppled President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> and swept the Sandinistas into power in July 1979.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> believes that heavy program trading may have helped force down stock prices last Jan. 8, the day of the third-worst market plunge. In a report released Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said it has detected high levels of computer-driven transactions late in that day's session, particularly in stocks frequently traded by institutional investors using programs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 140 points that day. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, using information it obtained from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, said that 75.4 million of the 197.3 million shares traded that day were sold after 2:30 p.m. Two-thirds of the decline occurred after 2:30 p.m. `` This heavy late selling activity occurred on relatively little fundamental economic news,'' the report said. The report stated that the role in the Jan. 8 plunge of index-related trading _ transactions involving baskets of stocks and futures _ `` was comparable to that during the week preceding Oct. 19.'' That was the day of the worst plunge in the stock market's history, a 508-point Dow Jones decline The study concluded that `` stock selling from index arbitrage may have accelerated the steepest portion of the market decline'' that day after 2:30 p.m. Index arbitrage is a strategy by which institutional traders, usually using computers, attempt to profit from price discrepancies between stocks and stock index futures. It and other forms of so-called program trading, in which computers guide huge transactions, have been called factors in the stock market's wildly surging price swings of recent months. The study said that only 13 percent of the shares traded Jan. 8 were generated by program selling. But more than one-third of the transactions after 2:30 p.m. involving stocks comprising the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock index were made by program traders, the report said. Stocks in the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index are frequently bought and sold by program traders. The report was released by Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> had requested the study, which was dated April 7 and sent to the congressman by <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>. `` I am deeply concerned about the impact of this continued volatility on our capital formation process and long-term economic growth,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> has been working on legislation designed to control market volatility.

 A cooperative and a factory made a tidy profit by selling cans of air for up to $ 8 each, a government newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> on Monday ran a front-page article about sales of air from the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, praising the enterprise as a `` living illustration of the possibilities of free initiative.'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said the state-run <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION> firm Studio was seeking financial sponsorship for a new cooperative when it turned for help to a factory that cans fruit, juices and jams. The factory offered to sell thousands of cans it had purchased several years earlier and then decided it could not use. The cooperative obtained the cans for 16 cents apiece, `` although it would seem the goods were completely useless,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. The cooperative labeled the cans `` Odessa Air. Gathered on the City's Streets During the Days of ` Humor,''' and sold them on April Fool's Day.

<HEAD>Court: Demjanjuk Killed People With His Hands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 One of three Israeli judges who convicted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> of Nazi war crimes said the death camp guard killed many people with his own hands and often exceeded the atrocities ordered by his superiors. `` He took part in the murders ... and did so willingly, enthusiastically,'' Judge <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said of the former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker during the 12-hour reading of the 450-page judgment Monday. Applause broke out in the courtroom when the court ruled that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was `` <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrible </PERSON>,'' a guard who operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1942 and 1943. The three-judge court convicted <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> of war crimes, crimes against the Jewish people, crimes against humanity and crimes against persecuted people. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 68, will be sentenced April 25 and could receive the death penalty. He was the second person to be convicted of Nazi war crimes in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, architect of the Holocaust, was convicted and hanged in 1962. `` I'm an innocent man. I will appeal and I'm sure I'll win,'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> told reporters as he walked slowly from the courthouse to a police van, his head bowed and his arms clasped. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> maintained his innocence through the 14-month trial, saying he was a victim of mistaken identity. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s lawyers and relatives accused the judges of bias. `` As far as I'm concerned, this was nothing more than a Soviet show trial,'' said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> 22. He and other family members stormed out of court in protest midway through the reading of the judgment. Holocaust survivor <PERSON> Eliyahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> hugged a prosecution assistant after the verdict and exclaimed, `` I feel better now,'' said the assistant, who would not give his name. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> was one of five <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> survivors who identified <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> heard the verdict from a cot in a courthouse cell, where guards carried him feet first after he complained of a back injury. Defense attorneys said he was in too much pain to sit in the courtroom. In the judgment, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was n't an ordinary guard, but `` fulfilled a central position'' at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>. `` With his own hands, he took part in the murders of masses of human beings ... showing initiative beyond what his superiors demanded of him,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> survivors have said `` Ivan'' would stand near gas chambers and strike prisoners with a metal bar or bayonet as they went to their deaths. Survivor <PERSON> Pinchas </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> was helped from the courtroom in tears after judges quoting from his testimony said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> `` would gloat at the crushed faces, the blood flowing after he brutalized people.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said the court gave great weight to the testimony of the five survivors and rejected defense claims that the witnesses were unreliable and suffered memory lapses. `` They -LRB- the witnesses -RRB- saw him day after day and followed his every action with fear, afraid they could be one of his victims,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. `` These experiences are deeply ingrained on their memories, the horrors are a deep part of them.'' The court also rejected the defense claim that the Ukrainian-born <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was a German prisoner of war in 1942 and 1943. The judges upheld a key piece of prosecution evidence, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s alleged Nazi identity card, which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> supplied. The card was issued at <LOCATION> Trawniki </LOCATION>, a training camp for death camp guards near <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>. It does not mention <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>, but states that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was posted at the nearby <LOCATION> Sobibor </LOCATION> death camp. Defense attorneys said the card is a Soviet forgery to punish <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> for fighting in an anti-communist unit the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> formed at the end of World War II. But Judge <PERSON> Daliah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorner </PERSON> said: `` We conclude the personal details on the ID card are those of the accused.'' Defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> called the trial unfair. `` My God in heaven, according to those judges we did n't do anything right,'' <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` They ruled against us on every single point, no matter how big or small. Justice was not done.'' `` This is going to go down in history as the most lopsided case ever conducted anywhere in the world,'' added <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son-in-law who raised $ 650,000 for the defense. Jewish leaders praised the verdict. Rabbi <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hier </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said in a statement distributed in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>: `` There is a bitter sense of irony in that this death camp guard determined to kill off any trace of Jewish life ... must now end his life in the Jewish state, watching from the window the uninterrupted growth of Jewish civilization.'' The trial began Feb. 16, 1987, a year after <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was extradited to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from suburban <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. He was stripped of his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship for lying on his immigration application.

 Sponsors of the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion postponed presenting the $ 369,000 prize to this year's winner while they investigate charges that he fostered anti-Semitism, a newspaper reported <PERSON> Inamullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was chosen last month to receive the award. He was the first Moslem to win the award, which has been presented 15 times. The American <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith protested, saying that <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> and his organization had fostered anti-Semitism for years, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, 73, of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, has denied the charges and said: `` I can never support anti-Semitic feelings because I am myself a descendant of Semitic ancestors from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' He said he differs with Zionists `` because the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has declared Zionism a racist creed.'' The decision to delay the presentation was announced last week, the Times said. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>'s supporters say he and his organization have been more willing than other Islamic groups to maintain contacts with Jewish representatives in national and international settings. However, The Moslem World, a newsletter of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has published many comments critical of Jews and Zionism. The newsletter also has advertised and endorsed `` The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s `` The International Jew,'' both notorious anti-Semitic tracts. Past recipients of the prize include <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aleksandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>. Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Templeton </PERSON>, an American-born financier living in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, established the prize in 1972 as a religious counterpart to the Nobel Prizes for peace, science and literature.

 Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> earned more as a speaker in 1987 than he did as governor, his tax returns show. In addition, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> donated almost $ 90,000 of his $ 278,988 in earnings last year to the state, according to the returns released Monday. The Democrat's income included $ 134,000 from speaking engagements and $ 125,988 from the state, which is slightly less than his $ 130,000 gubernatorial salary because of state payroll scheduling and tax deferring, aides said.

 The signs of change were apparent as <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> prepared to swear in a new mayor for the first time in 28 years, bidding farewell to feisty veteran <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> and welcoming newcomer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>, whose 28-year tenure was the longest of any big-city mayor in the nation, was scheduled to give up the office today with the swearing in of <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>, 70, a past president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION>, announced last year he would not seek re-election because of his age. The 38-year-old <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> a Democrat, planned to resign as a state senator this morning before being sworn in as mayor. Aides said Monday that <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> wants broader powers that would enable him to hire and fire certain officials of this city of 636,000 who now have set terms of office. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, who headed <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON>'s transition team, said Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> supported proposed legislation to make the change. `` We were elected here with a mandate for change,'' <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said. `` It would be an attempt to establish a true cabinet-style government.'' <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> also said he would support naming a city viaduct in honor of civil rights leader <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Groppi </PERSON>, who died in 1985. <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>, who often found himself at odds with <PERSON> Groppi </PERSON>'s protest tactics during open-housing marches and other campaigns of the 1960s, vetoed the name-change proposal last year, and the <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> failed by one vote to override the veto. <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>, who fought for increased federal and state aid for cities, marked his last day in office by taking a jab at a familiar adversary: the city's afternoon newspaper.

 Investigators probing an engine fire that caused a <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> plane to crash here said Monday night the same engine emitted a strong fuel odor days before the accident. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators also said a 1987 engine fire in a similar plane forced an emergency landing. The pilot of the plane that crashed told the investigators that a different <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Havilland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dash </ORGANIZATION> 8 prop plane he was flying about a week before Friday's crash at <ORGANIZATION> Seattle-Tacoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> lost power briefly in one of its engines, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said at a news conference. Although the engine immediately regained power, pilot <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> aborted that flight and landed. He told the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> he understood from other pilots that such a problem `` was not uncommon, but it was certainly not a regular occurrence,'' <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> did not say where that flight originated and landed. A June 1987 engine fire aboard a de Havilland Dash 8 involved fuel spilled into the engine cowling and forced the plane, which had taken off from <LOCATION> Sea-Tac </LOCATION>, to make an emergency landing at <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. That fire `` involved maintenance-oriented issues relating to the positioning of -LRB- fuel -RRB- lines ... that could be crimped upon closing of various access panels,'' <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. Horizon Air changed maintenance procedures after that fire, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said, adding `` We do n't know at this point if the -LRB- June 1987 and the latest fire -RRB- are related.'' The plane that crashed Friday night, injuring 19 of the 40 people aboard as it smashed into a passenger concourse loading ramp, was one of 10 Dash 8s in the Horizon fleet. <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said the investigation will try to determine why there was the fuel on the cowling over the right engine before the crash, and what caused the fuel to ignite. <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said the fuel was noticed by passengers. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> also told investigators of a maintenance log entry a week to 10 days before the crash that described a strong fuel odor coming from the same engine that caught fire, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. `` There was some maintenance done and nobody complained of the smell after -LRB- the April 8 report -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. Horizon Air President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said earlier Monday that airline crews checked engines on the company's Dash-8s but found no problems that would lead to a fire. The checks were not related to the official investigation into the crash, he added. The mangled plane probably will be moved Tuesday to a hangar, where the right turboprop engine will be removed, said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>. The engine will be sent to the manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, and taken apart under <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> supervision, he said. <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said investigators still did not know why the plane veered off a runway and headed toward the terminal after it touched down. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> and co-pilot <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilstad </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators Sunday in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, that they applied full force to the brakes and locked the emergency brake, but could not avoid ramming the passenger ramp. They also said they pushed hard on the right rudder in an effort to steer the aircraft. The pilots' comments during a closed-door meeting were overheard by reporters outside. The pilots said the fire erupted so quickly they had little time to make an emergency landing. They said they realized they were going too fast and appeared to be coming down too high to adequately slow down, but had no choice except to land. Three of the injured passengers remained hospitalized Monday, including <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Clarkston </LOCATION>, who was in serious but stable condition.

<HEAD>City To Celebrate 350th With An Eye Toward Solving Problems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 This city on the upswing is using its 350th birthday to celebrate its successes and find new ways to deal with the urban ills that provide a constant reminder of its failings. But not everyone believes there is reason to celebrate. Critics point to the grim statistics that often dominate descriptions of New Haven: a high poverty rate that makes it one of the nation's poorest cities; blighted neighborhoods; the large number of drug-related AIDS cases. But the organizers of `` New Haven 350'' say that despite the problems, a celebration is in order for this self-proclaimed cultural capital of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, which has enjoyed a multimillion-dollar revitalization in recent years and is home to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` We feel the city has turned the corner and is moving in a very positive direction,'' said <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Yale-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> official who is one of the co-chairmen of the birthday celebration. The people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> `` have reason to be proud of what we have achieved to date,'' said <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>. Three major events are scheduled to celebrate the birthday: a city fair June 4 and 5, a giant fireworks show July 4, and series of town meetings sometime this fall. While the first two events are intended to showcase the city's achievements and demonstrate its worthiness as a tourist attraction, the town meetings will be used to mobilize the entire community for problem-solving <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and other major institutions and businesses are helping to fund the events. This Sunday, Mayor <PERSON> Biagio </PERSON> <PERSON> DiLieto </PERSON> and the dean of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s drama school will narrate a history of the city during a concert that also will mark the first public performance of a score composed in honor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>'s birthday by a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> professor. `` I recognize, of course, some people might question the need for a celebration given the many serious human and social problems we have,'' <PERSON> DiLieto </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` But I believe a birthday celebration is uplifting to the spirt of the people.'' Only those who have witnessed the changes over the last decade in this city of 126,000 people can appreciate the amount of progress that has been made, said <PERSON> DiLieto </PERSON>. The downtown has undergone a transformation that amounts to nothing less than a renaissance, according to the mayor. And the work continues. In addition to new shops, officials say more than 1 million square feet of office space is under construction or proposed for the next five years as developers gamble the resurgence will continue and new companies will be lured to the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> port founded by the <ORGANIZATION> Puritans </ORGANIZATION> in 1638. But critics say much of what the city has done is merely cosmetic, and that the main beneficiaries of the downtown redevelopment have been developers, not the people who make <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, according to the 1980 census, the seventh poorest city in the nation. `` They are fixing up the downtown but they are doing nothing in the black community,'' said <PERSON> Haywood </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a research chemist who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` Unfortunately, I do n't think it is time for blacks to celebrate,'' he said. Blacks comprise more than 30 percent of the population. <PERSON> DiLieto </PERSON>, who has been in office since 1980, said his administration has demonstrated a commitment to the neighborhoods as well as the downtown. The city has created more than 3,000 housing units for mostly low - and middle-income people and has provided loans and grants, as well as accompanying public improvements, for property owners who wish to make their own improvements, he said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilgert </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, a provider of emergency services and advocate for the poor and homeless, said the administration `` clearly has made efforts'' to help the disadvantaged but that `` the concern for economic development needs to be geared more to jobs that get people above the poverty level.''

<TEXT>
 Supporters of retired autoworker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> were outraged that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> judges convicted him as the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp guard `` Ivan the Terrible,'' and said the decision will rouse anti-Semitism in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, a Ukrainian immigrant to the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Seven </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, was convicted Monday in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of war crimes in connection with the deaths of 850,000 Jews at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1942 and 1943. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacyk </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> resident of Ukrainian descent who helped raise money for <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, said Monday the effect the verdict has on the world view of the Jewish community will be similar to the `` crucifixion of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. `` I think people will be outraged because they know <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is innocent,'' <PERSON> Jacyk </PERSON> said. `` In the long run, it will have a very negative effect on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Jews. It will definitely be long-remembered.'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, who could be sentenced to death or life imprisonment when the court reconvenes April 25, has gotten some of his strongest backing from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> area residents of Ukrainian descent. More than 200 people gathered Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vladimir </ORGANIZATION>'s Cathedral in <ORGANIZATION> Parma </ORGANIZATION>, a Ukrainian Orthodox church, to pray for <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 68, and his family `` It -LRB- the conviction -RRB- is bound to have a negative effect on the American population's view of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Liscynesky </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Parma </ORGANIZATION>, who heads the Cleveland-area <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>. `` The majority of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> feel that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is innocent.'' <PERSON> Liscynesky </PERSON> said `` telephones are probably very hot'' spreading the word among local Ukrainians about <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s conviction. He said his coalition has about 20,000 active members. There are an estimated 2 million people of Ukrainian descent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I understand very well why they -LRB- Ukrainians -RRB- are hurting very badly,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plax </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's like when someone gets cut and you yell ` ouch' and you start cursing. That's what they're doing right now. In time I suspect the dust will settle and we'll get back to doing things to bring the two communities together.'' <PERSON> Plax </PERSON> said he was `` profoundly shocked by the sternness of the judges' verdict.'' But a former <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> lawyer who helped win <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s extradition to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1986 said the conviction did n't surrprise him. `` I think there was no doubt that he was given a fair trial, that every possible defense was raised and thoroughly defended,'' said <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodish </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer who practices in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` There can be no doubt who <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> really is.'' <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON>, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, hailed the conviction of <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> as `` gratifying evidence that even 40 years after the Holocaust, justice can prevail over evil.'' <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON> said the year-long trial `` reflected <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s commitment to the <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> rule of law.'' In <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Rausch </PERSON>, who attended the trial, said on behalf of her local chapter of Holocaust Survivors and Friends in Pursuit of Justice, `` We commend the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for accepting this reponsibility and we hope they will continue to prosecute <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war criminals who have found haven throughout the world.'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> prosecutor who formerly sponsored legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to allow for deportation of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war criminals, said the conviction `` sends the world a signal that Nazi war criminals can not escape.''

 <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> defended <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> because he was convinced the retired autoworker could n't be the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp guard who savagely beat Jews on the way to the gas chamber. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was a gentle old man who'd bounce <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s 3-year-old daughter on his knee, smiling and talking nonsense <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> lawyer who specialized in immigration law, moved to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to defend the 68-year-old Ukrainian who lived in a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> had insisted it was a case of mistaken identity and warned that an innocent man should not be punished because of a desire for revenge. That was five years ago. Today, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> is pondering the man he thought he knew, the man who was convicted Monday in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of being the sadistic guard known as `` Ivan the Terrible.'' `` Toward the end, I looked at how calmly and cooly he removed me from this case after I fought for him for so many years believing in him, believing in his credibility,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` I began to wonder whether I'd made a mistake.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who was the chief defense attorney until last year when he was removed by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> court at <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s request, said the case against his former client was extensive. The defense depended on creating a reasonable doubt about whether <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was `` <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> tried to show that documents supplied by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> linking <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> were forged. He also he tried to cast doubt on the testimony of witnesses, many of whom were old and in frail health. The court, however, rejected the arguments. `` We determine decisively and without hesitation or doubt that the accused <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> who is on trial before us, is <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible, the operator of the gas chambers,'' said presiding Judge <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>'s summation indicated that the judges gave great weight to the testimony of five survivors who identified <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> as the Ukrainian guard at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The court also noted that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s testimony was `` filled with inconsistent versions.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s testimony was `` spotty,'' and said he understood how the judges could have conceived of <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s memory lapses as incriminating. He said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> chose not to prepare for cross-examination. `` It was one of the exceptions he took with the court and ultimately with his defense,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who was asked to take the case by <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s daughter, was dismissed because of a dispute with <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s family and the Ukrainian community that supported him over the direction of the `` They -LRB- the family -RRB- did n't understand the culture or country the way I did,'' he said of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` To explain why I was using a Talmudic argument to a religious judge sitting on the bench was something that became more and more difficult. ... `` They thought I was pro-Jewish,'' he said. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he thought it was irrational to attack the Holocaust survivors who are considered a national resource. The attorney that replaced <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> as chief defender, <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON>, changed the tone of the defense, trying to discredit the prosecution's witnesses. The tactic may have damaged the defense because it alienated public opinion, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` The whole country was affixed to the trial and there was a sense that the judges knew they were deciding for the people,'' he said. Showing respect and deference was the only way to keep people from viewing <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> as a `` symbol of past wrongs,'' he said. Despite the emotionally charged atmosphere, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> thinks <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> got a fair trial. `` It ca n't be said that he -LRB- <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> -RRB- did n't have every opportunity to present evidence,'' he said. `` He could n't have got a fairer trial.'' Under Israeli law, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s case will automatically be appealed and will probably be reviewed by the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said the court would give the case an extensive review and offer <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> another chance to cast doubt on whether he is `` Ivan the Terrible.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> fired land-based Silkworm missiles at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> during a battle in which American forces destroyed two Iranian oil platforms and sank or damaged six Iranian vessels. The three-ship convoy led by the USS <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> took evasive action and fired chaff into the air, which confused the Silkworms' radar guidance system and caused the five missiles to miss the convoy in the southern gulf The missile attack on Monday represented the first reported firing of the Silkworm batteries along <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s coast at ships in the southern gulf or the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the waterway's narrow entrance. The attack was witnessed by <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON> who was aboard the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> with a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news media pool. Besides the frigate <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the convoy included two destroyers, the <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and the <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. Iranian forces on Monday also raided <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> oil facilities; <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> merchant vessels; and a press helicopter. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces sank or damaged four Iranian attack boats and disabled two Iranian frigates. Monday's fighting between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> began when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> attacked two Iranian oil platforms as a `` measured response'' to the explosion of a mine, allegedly planted by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, that blew a hole in the American USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> last Thursday and wounded 10 sailors. The fighting that followed was the most intense since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered last summer that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces be strengthened in the gulf, where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. No American casualties were reported in Monday's fighting. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was searching for a Cobra attack helicopter with two crewmen that had not returned to a cruiser. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said several people were killed or injured in the attack on the two oil platforms but gave no further details. In a separate dispatch, the news agency also said on Monday night that Iranian warships `` in a heroic clash with the aggressor American helicopters in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> shot down one of them Monday afternoon.'' Two groups of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships struck the Iranian oil platforms <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION> and Sirri-D, 100 miles apart in the southern gulf, on Monday morning. Crews on the platforms were given advance warning to evacuate the platforms, which have been used as bases for speedboat attacks on neutral shipping. One platform was destroyed by naval gunfire and the other by explosives placed on it, according to statements in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Iranian news agency said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships attacked the <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION> platform first, then hit the Nasr platform off nearby <LOCATION> Sirri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Iranian gunboats then went on a rampage in the southern gulf. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter was fired upon during the raid on the platforms but not hit. Iranians shot at a press helicopter carrying an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> crew and <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiller </PERSON>, but missed. <PERSON> Schiller </PERSON> said the `` Iranians fired at least half a dozen .50 - caliber rounds and small-arms fire'' at the He said part of Sirri-D collapsed and the platform still was burning before sundown. <PERSON> Sassan </PERSON> was badly damaged `` but the main structure was still standing and the fire was put out by five Iranian tugboats, which also fired at our helicopter,'' <PERSON> Schiller </PERSON> said. Two Iranian warplanes tried to harass a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship but the ship fired missiles and the aircraft fled, shipping sources in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> reported. They said an Iranian patrol boat fired at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruiser <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON>, one of the ships attacking <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION> and Sirri-D, but did not hit it. The frigate <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> returned fire and sank the Iranian boat, the sources added. In late afternoon, the 310-foot Iranian frigate Sahand confronted three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. Ignoring repeated warnings, the Sahand fired at three A-6 Intruder aircraft near the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. The USS Strauss hit the Sahand with a Harpoon missile that left the Iranian ship ablaze, according to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> reports. Pentagon officials said the Iranian frigate Sabalan fired on an A-6 and the plane attacked, hitting the ship with a laser-guided bomb. Iranian warships also attacked oil facilities at the <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> oil field off the emirate of <LOCATION> Sharjah </LOCATION> in the southern gulf, targeting the Scanbay drilling rig, the 112,744-ton British tanker <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and a storage facility, shipping executives reported. They said the <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> was set afire and its crew abandoned ship, and the Scanbay reported attacks by four gunboats. Iranian gunboats fired at but missed the American tugboat <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tide </PERSON>, operated by <ORGANIZATION> Tidewater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Warplanes they could not identify flew low over the attacking Iranians, forcing them to flee, the executives said.

 Four siblings brutally stabbed to death in their home were buried side-by-side as family members called for a reform of a judicial system they partly blamed for the deaths. More than 1,000 mourners filed past the caskets of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 19; <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 17; <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 15; and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 11 before their burial Monday. The four were killed early Friday when an assailant broke into their mobile home and attacked them with steak knives, some of which broke in their bodies because of the strength of the blows, authorities have said. The parents, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, who are separated and were not home at the time of the attack, had to be supported physically by relatives as they walked to the burial site. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s 20-year-old former boyfriend, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was arrested shortly after the attack, remained in jail today under $ 4.05 million bond on four capital murder charges and a charge of criminal mischief. <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an uncle of the victims, told reporters before the memorial service that the judicial system was flawed because police did not arrest <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> quickly enough in connection with an earlier threat against the children and their friends. `` Although <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and their four children believed enough in the system to allow the police department and the district attorney's office to protect them from threat and harm, the one fact remains, what should have happened did not,'' <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. `` It is our hope this tragedy might serve as a catalyst for all of us nationally to personally protest the system that has evolved,'' he said. `` The system protects and shelters the rights of the few and in so doing neglects the needs of the many. The time for change is now, lest another family need go through the agony and torture of loss, whether one or many.'' <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> was accused of threatening <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s current boyfriend, <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 24, and of damaging <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s pickup truck during a fight on March 28. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> had filed a complaint against <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> had given police statements about the incident. Authorities said they were looking for <PERSON> Narvaiz </PERSON> before the attack occurred. The friends and family members who attended the memorial service walked past four identical closed caskets, marked with the victims' pictures and surrounded by hundreds of roses and pink and blue carnations The Rev. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON> told mourners he had talked with the children's mother and, `` She wanted more than anything else for the young people that are here to understand the hurt and the pain so that you, too, may be prepared for it one day. ... This proves to us today that we live in a sinful and murderous world.''

<TEXT>
 Opponents of new abortion restrictions sued in state and federal courts to head off provisions of a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law before it takes effect next week. `` The goal is to block the implementation of the nation's most restrictive abortion control law,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, said of the lawsuit filed Monday. `` This law seeks to make an abortion as difficult to obtain as possible, physically, financially and emotionally,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>, a lawyer for the Philadelphia-based Women's Law Project. Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> is confident the law, which he signed March 25, will stand up in court, said his press secretary, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grotevant </PERSON>. `` We drafted it with the constitution in mind,'' said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Viglietta </PERSON>, a spokesman for the anti-abortion <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. `` It will pass the constitutional muster.'' The law is scheduled to take effect Sunday, but <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON> said lawyers would press this week for court injunctions to prevent that. `` We have a number of reasons for believing that this law will not go into effect as scheduled,'' said <PERSON> Steffan </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, the state <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> legal director. The suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> challenges the law's requirement that minors obtain parental or judicial consent before abortions The restrictions violate rights of privacy, due process and freedom of association guaranteed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> and other federal laws, the suit says. It also challenges reporting requirements that would force clinics and doctors that provide abortions to supply information to the state. Those provisions could open clinics, doctors and women seeking abortions to harassment and potentional violence from anti-abortion activists, Ms. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> said. A companion suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is aimed at a provision that would require indigent rape and incest victims to report the crimes to law-enforcement agencies before they could receive Medicaid funding for an abortion. The suit was filed on behalf of an unidentified Medicaid recipient who has twice been the victim of rape and was mistreated by police when she reported the crime, the suit says. Additional plaintiffs include Women Organized Against Rape, the <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blackwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the counseling organization, Choice. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beliveau </PERSON>, legislative coordinator for the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said the lawsuit seeks to `` allow the abortion industry to keep parents in the dark'' about the health of their children. `` It is inconceivable that pro-abortion groups would challenge legislation that provides parents with the right to supervise the health care of their minor children,'' she added. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down key provisions of a 1982 law. Those provisions required doctors to make a record that could be made public of every abortion they performed; required doctors to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and available benefits for prenatal care and childbirth; and required the presence of two doctors for abortions performed in the third trimester. In December, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, a Democrat, vetoed an abortion control bill that would have required notification of sexual partners or parental notification in the case of a minor.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Contra leaders, treated to a heroes' return by dozens of Nicaraguan exiles here, expressed satisfaction with the progress made during peace talks in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> even though no agreement was reached. `` We were able to come out of the four days and still keep negotiating,'' said <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, one of four Nicaraguan Resistance directors who arrived at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> International Airport late Monday. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed rebels are scheduled to meet again in the capital of their country at the end of the month. The peace talks that were adjourned Monday marked the first time in the 6 -LCB- - year-old war that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to negotiate with their foes in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> `` Things are better than they were,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said after the singing and cheering died down at the airport. `` Our major accomplishment has been to sit with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> face to face,'' said director <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, adding that the climate of the talks was `` sincere.'' `` In my opinion, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> behaved responsibly,'' <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said. But he also said his expectations going into the talks were not high, and he emphasized that the government needed to institute democratic changes. Negotiations have been deadlocked over the so-called `` democratization'' issue. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have insisted the rebels sign a permanent truce immediately. They say Contra delegates would then be allowed to take part in a `` national reconciliation dialogue'' with leaders of the country's 14 legally recognized political parties. Contra leaders are demanding that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> first carry out democratic reforms, or at least pledge to do so. The Contras and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> last month signed a peace agreement that provided for a temporary cease-fire while they negotiated a permanent truce. The 60-day cease-fire went into effect April 1. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Monday, the Contra leaders visited Roman Catholic officials and editors at <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, the only opposition newspaper and whose publisher is <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON>. His father, also named <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, was slain Jan. 10, 1978, in a killing widely blamed on the right-wing government in power at the time. The slaying helped unleash the revolt that toppled President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> and swept the Sandinistas into power in July 1979. Also returning here were <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance, an umbrella rebel organization based in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

 Presentation of the $ 369,000 <ORGANIZATION> Templeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prize </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> in Religion has been postponed because of an investigation of charges that this year's winner helped spread anti-Semitism, a newspaper reported today. <PERSON> Inamullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was to have received the award May 10, according to an announcement last month by the sponsors of the annual prize. He was the first Moslem to win the award, which has been presented 15 times. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that prize officers have delayed the presentation pending an investigation that centers on complaints by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith that <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> and his organization have fostered anti-Semitism for years. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> says he has difference with Zionists `` because the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has declared Zionism a racist creed.'' But he said, `` I can never support anti-Semitic feelings because I am myself a descendant of Semitic ancestors from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> Templeton </LOCATION> officers praised <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> last month for promoting interreligious cooperation, and his supporters say he and his organization have been more willing than other Islamic groups to maintain contacts with Jews. But the Times reported that the newsletter of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, while under <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>'s direction, published praise of anti-Semitic tracts and accused Jews and Zionists of controlling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politics and media.

 The dollar closed higher today against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, while stock prices declined modestly following the news of increased fighting in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and the overnight easing on Wall Street. The dollar closed at 124.37 yen, up 0.59 yen from its close of 123.78 yen Monday. It had opened the day at 124.40 yen and fluctuated between 124.25 yen and 124.53 yen. `` The dollar started the day substantially higher, boosted by the overnight advance in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but it moved in a narrow range throughout the day,'' said <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawai </PERSON> of the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

The Nikkei index was down 226.64 points at the end of the morning session as participants, nervous about the gulf fighting, sidestepped the market, traders said. The release of a number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese economic indicators later this week and the approach of the holiday-studded `` Golden Week'' have also kept some investors on the sidelines, they said.

<TEXT>
 A lawyer persuaded <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> to sign a will he did n't want shortly before his death, then `` began robbing <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s grave'' by mismanaging hundreds of thousands of dollars from the estate, an attorney says. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>, executor of the estate, wanted <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s money and even went to the entertainer's <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, home after his death and declared, `` I am <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>,'' attorney <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Gewerter </PERSON> charged during opening arguments in a civil suit. But <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> testified Monday in state district court that <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> called him three weeks before his death and asked that the will be updated and that longtime manager <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> be replaced as executor by <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>. `` He said he did not want to use <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> anymore and asked me if I could do it,'' said <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said the flamboyant entertainer wanted to make sure that most of the estate went to a trust to fund the <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Performing Arts, which provides scholarships at 22 colleges. The will named Strote trustee of the foundation. Outside court, <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, who is one of the five plaintiffs, estimated <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s estate at $ 20 million. About $ 2 million was raised last week in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> auction of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s belongings. Gewerter charged Monday that <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> executed <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s will 13 days before the multi-millionaire's death and the performer had no idea what he was signing. `` Liberace was in such a mental state on -LRB- Jan. -RRB- 22nd that he could n't understand or read independently,'' <PERSON> Gewerter </PERSON> said. `` If -LRB- comedian -RRB- Pee Wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> had walked into his room and said he wanted to be executor, he -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- would have said ` yes.' He -LRB- Strote -RRB- goes into that room owning nothing and comes out with a bag of goodies.'' <PERSON> Gewerter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> has mismanaged hundreds of thousands of dollars from the estate, and that <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> is spending the estate's money on personal possessions `` The fraud of Mr. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> does n't stop with the will,'' <PERSON> Gewerter </PERSON> said. `` He believed he was the embodiment of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>. He wanted to be <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>. More important _ he wanted <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s money. Once he became trustee he began robbing <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s grave.'' The suit seeks to replace <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> as trustee with <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s close friend and manager for 36 years, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBella </PERSON>, the late performer's accountant. It also seeks to remove <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> as executor of the will. In his opening remarks, <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>, said the plaintiffs were only angry that they did not get more money out of the estate and that <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> had served well as executor. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s doctor declared him physically and mentally fit just before they met to sign the will at the entertainer's <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> home Jan. 22, 1987. `` He read what I highlighted but I do n't think he read every word,'' <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said. `` He asked me generally what was the importance of each paper.'' <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> died Feb. 5, 1987, of complications stemming from AIDS. He was 67. <PERSON> Gewerter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> had vowed three months earlier to fire Strote, who had served as <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s attorney on various occasions. The other plaintiffs are <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s longtime friend and housekeeper at the <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> home; <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a companion of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s for six years before his death; <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, the only living sibling of the family; and <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Luckie </PERSON>, the housekeeper at <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> home.

<HEAD>On Demanjuk Judgment Day, Jews Honor Treblinka Victims</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The same day an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> court convicted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> of war crimes, hundreds of Jews visited the <ORGANIZATION> Treblinka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp where 850,000 Jews perished in the gas chambers he helped operate. As a cantor's mournful chant wafted across the vast open field covering the camp's remains, the visitors searched Monday among thousands of jagged memorial stones for the names of the Polish towns where the victims had lived. `` My parents were killed here, my sisters, my brothers, an uncle, an aunt were all killed here,'' said <PERSON> Jakub </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberstein </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, who was wearing a striped concentration camp inmate's cap `` All I know is that if I had a gun, I would shoot <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> with my own hands,'' <PERSON> Silberstein </PERSON>, a survivor of the <LOCATION> Buchenwald </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camps, said Monday. The court in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> ruled on Monday that the Ukrainian-born <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker, was the notorious guard `` <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible,'' who helped operate the gas chambers at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>. The emotional pilgrimage for hundreds of Jews from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries followed observances of the 45th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto Uprising. Accompanying the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> delegation was <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilczur </PERSON>, an official with the Polish government's <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war crimes investigation commission who assisted <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> prosecutors in gathering evidence for <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s trial. `` Being here on this day has a symbolic significance,'' he said. `` It is not a trial of one <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> -LRB- that is important -RRB-. It's a trial of the German system of homicide.'' On Tuesday, the Jewish visitors followed the last route of the condemned Jews of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto, traveling to <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> after dedicating a new memorial at the <LOCATION> Umschlagplatz </LOCATION>, the site near the railroad siding from which 300,000 Jews were deported to Nazi death camps. Traveling by bus, they made the 53-mile trip to <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, in about 1 -LCB- hours. Forty-five years ago, the cattle cars packed with people sometimes took several days to travel the same route. In 1942-43, a whole trainload of people could be undressed, stripped of their belongings and killed in two hours. The 13 gas chambers could kill 2,000 people in 10 to 15 minutes. The <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> razed the camp to the ground after a bloody prisoners' revolt on Aug. 2, 1943, and planted trees to hide the traces of their crimes, which today give the site a strangely serene atmosphere The Polish government is now raising money to build a museum at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>, where there is now only a memorial of stones, erected in 1963, built to resemble a symbolic graveyard. At the center of the 23-acre site is a massive granite column, resembling a tombstone, with a menorah, a traditional symbol of <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, hewn into one side. In front is a stone with the inscription in six languages: `` Never again.'' `` My feet are planted on this land which has mixed on it the ashes of 800,000 Jews who were brought here,'' said <PERSON> Chaika </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosman </PERSON>, a member of the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, and survivor of the 1943 Jewish ghetto uprising in the Polish city of <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION>. `` My nation was destroyed before my eyes and I was helpless,'' she said, speaking at a memorial rally in front of the monument that was attended by about 1,000 Jews and Poles. `` I come here from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a pilgrim to the graves of my predecessors.'' Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Itzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Navon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said the only positive answer to the Holocaust and <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> is `` increasing our numbers'' and `` strengthening the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' People walked among the 17,000 stones scattered in the field surrounding the memorial column, 130 of which bear the names of Polish cities and towns such as <LOCATION> Biala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Podlaska </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ostrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> whose Jewish inhabitants were transported to <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>. Other stone markers are inscribed with the names of the 10 countries from which Jews were sent here _ <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Some of the Jewish visitors also prayed by an open pit, filled with melted black basalt, which stands in the place where the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> burned the bodies of their victims. Walking back to the buses on this sunny, warm spring day, with temperatures in the 70s, visitors could hear birds singing in the fir trees surrounding the field of stones, which evoke such terrible memories.

<HEAD>Peace Talks Suspended; Ortega Warns Against Stalling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 High-ranking government and rebel delegations agreed on a 10-day suspension of direct peace talks after a fourth day of negotiations failed to produce a definitive cease-fire pact. Also Monday, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> warned that Sandinista troops would continue fighting the U.S.-backed rebel forces if rebel negotiators bowed to pressure from their top military commander not to sign an accord. A joint communique issued at the end of Monday's talks said the government and the Contras, as the rebels are known, would next meet in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> April 28-30 to continue negotiations to end their 6 -LCB- - year-old civil war The statement described talks between Sandinista officials and leaders of the Contras' Nicaraguan Resistance organization as `` frank and cordial,'' and said the two sides had entered into `` permanent session'' to reach an accord. Contra leader <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> told reporters that government and rebel officials had agreed `` that at any moment we can renew the negotiations to give continuity to this process.'' `` We are certain the negotiations will end in success,'' said Nicaraguan Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who headed the government's negotiating team. President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, the defense minister's brother, charged that Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, the Contra military commander, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were pressuring rebel negotiators to avoid a cease-fire agreement. According to <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> threatened the Resistance directorate saying rebel military forces `` would liquidate them'' if they signed an agreement with the government. `` If this happens, it would leave us no other road but to achieve a total victory in the military field,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told thousands of government supporters gathered in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s Plaza de la Revolucion on Monday evening. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, leaders of the Resistance directorate, denied <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s claim. The directorate's six members arrived in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Friday for the first time since the civil war began in November 1981. They left the country Monday evening. Officials from both sides declined to provide details on the latest round of talks. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said they were `` an advance and not a failure,'' while <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, the highest-ranking Resistance official, told reporters that both sides were `` on the road to an understanding.'' Negotiations reportedly stalled over the issue of when the Sandinistas would introduce democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Arriving in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Monday night, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said that would be the top issue when talks resume. The Sandinistas insist the rebels sign a permanent truce immediately. They say Contra delegates would then be allowed to take part in a `` national reconciliation dialogue'' with leaders of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s 14 legally recognized political parties. Contra leaders demand the Sandinistas first carry out a series of democratic reforms, or at least pledge to do so, before they will sign a pact. The two sides signed a provisional agreement on March 23 which provided for a temporary cease-fire while they negotiated a permanent truce. A 60-day cease-fire went into effect April 1. The Contras on Monday proposed that the temporary cease-fire be extended another month while both sides seek agreement. There was no immediate government response.

<HEAD>Banks Reopen For First Time in 45 Days; Only For Deposits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some Panamanian and foreign banks opened for the first time in 45 days, but only to accept deposits. One banker said the opening simply created the appearance that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s financial system can recover. Business was brisk on Monday at a few major foreign banks, but slow at institutions owned and operated by Panamanians. The <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ordered the reopening as a first step in the resumption of full banking services. Banks closed March 3 after a run on deposits, prompted by the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> which was orchestrated by strongman Gen. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Panamanians have been unable to cash paychecks or gain access to checking accounts since the closing and have conducted business on a cash-only basis. The manager of a foreign bank, speaking on condition his name not be used, said that Monday's limited reopening `` gives the illusion that things are becoming normal. I do n't know whether it will work or not.'' He said the move would `` allow circulation of checks _ reestablish the check as an acceptable payment in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' He noted, however, that clients depositing checks still would not be able to draw cash from their accounts unless the banks resume full services. `` But if you owe money to someone and he will accept a check, you can write a check on your new balance,'' he said. Even such a transaction would be guaranteed only if the partial reopening works as envisioned under a complex set of rules issued by the banking commission. Bankers said customers who made deposits Monday should know by next week if the checks cleared and have been credited to their accounts. Some financial sources predicted the new system would n't work as long as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s cash crunch continues and the government fails to resolve the political crisis that prompted the collapse of the banking system. The <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents most of the more than 120 banks doing business in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, has said repeatedly that its members will not resume full service until the government can assure a steady, adequate supply of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars, which <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> uses as its official currency. Panamanians began withdrawing large sums of money begining Feb. 26, the day <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> orchestrated the dismissal of <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> for trying to fire him as chief of the armed forces and police. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the head of the 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the power behind the civilian government. In retaliation, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ordered economic sanctions that included the freezing of Panamanian accounts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and withholding revenues from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> toll fees. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under federal indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate president. Word of Monday's partial bank reopening had been announced in newspapers through the weekend. About 30 people lined up outside the local office of <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> before opening time Monday and another 10 were outside the <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> branch. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s private and government banks, their solvency in question, appeared to be doing far less business. Except for the few who came with cash, customers said they were depositing checks they had accumulated since March 3. Some customers expressed optimism that the limited reopening might lead to the return of normal banking services in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` They're trying something new,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> employee who was depositing checks there. `` I do n't know if it'll work It might. We'll give it a try.'' But <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, like most others, was being cautious. `` Ill keep my cash at home. Later on, maybe, I'll deposit cash.'' A middle-aged Panamanian woman in the same line said she also was depositing only checks. `` I need the cash to eat,'' she said.

 More than 300 safe-deposit boxes were cleaned out after thieves cut a bank's alarm system and drilled a hole through a concrete floor into the vault, police say. Everything of value contained in the boxes at the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was stolen over the weekend, police said. `` They knew just where they were going and acted in a calculating and intelligent manner,'' said a police source The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> quoted without naming. Bank officials and investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police would n't comment, but the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> quoted police sources as saying the robbery was believed to have occurred over several hours Sunday. Bank President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> and investigators declined to estimate the value of the loss. According to police, the thieves were believed to have gained entrance to the bank's second floor through an emergency fire door, although there was no evidence of forced entry. Several panels from a dropped ceiling were pushed out, and alarm wires behind them apparently were cut and a bypass wire slipped into place. The thieves entered an unlocked and empty second-floor vault, from which they drilled a hole into the first-floor vault that contained the safe-deposit boxes, the Globe reported.

 A meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Bryce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> and his top administrators represents only the first step for improving life for blacks at the school, says a black student leader. `` I think the students are aware that this is just a beginning and what's going to be needed is further organization, further commitment and further negotiations,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, a student organization. Before the meeting, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> announced he would withdraw trespassing charges and the threat of university sanctions against 89 students arrested for a 15-hour sit-in that ended April 9. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> and nine other black student leaders negotiated with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and four senior administrators for five hours Monday on minority issues ranging from financial aid for blacks to creating a vice president for minority affairs. `` I think we made some progress,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. `` There were some things we had to say no to. There were some things we could say yes to and some things we had to look at.'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> agreed to create a vice president for minority affairs and also agreed in principle to work toward a goal of 8 percent black student enrollment and faculty membership. Last fall, <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> failed to reach a court-mandated goal of 5 percent black enrollment. Of the school's 67,000 students, a total of 2,424, or 3.6 percent, are black. <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> has 57 black faculty members, or 1.6 percent of its 4,100 instructors. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said he could n't commit the university to more financial aid for blacks. `` We think your arguments make good sense. ... We simply are not going to make budget decisions in this setting,'' he said. Before the negotiations began, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> granted amnesty to the protesters. More than 150 students occupied the telecommunications building April 8 after <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> canceled a meeting with student activists because ground rules could not be reached in advance. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> had sent two administrators to meet with student leaders behind closed doors, but the students demanded an open meeting. Students still in the building at dawn the next day were charged with trespassing and faced university sanctions, including possible dismissal.

<HEAD>Police Being Replaced After Rioting in Sungait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many police officers in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> are being replaced because they were incapable of dealing with ethnic rioting that claimed the lives of at least 32 people, an official said. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Demidov </PERSON>, deputy minister of internal affairs, said in an interview Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Vremya </ORGANIZATION> television news program that younger people, many of whom recently served in the army, were replacing the policemen. He did not say how many officers were being removed. Riots broke out in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> on Feb. 28 and continued for three days as Armenian demonstrators demanded annexation to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which is part of the neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> republic. About three-quarters of the residents of Nagorno-Karabackh are Armenians. Soviet officials rejected the annexation demand but promised a program to improve cultural and economic development in the area. <PERSON> Demidov </PERSON> said, `` Unfortunately, many <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> policemen were not up to the extreme conditions'' during the rioting. He did not elaborate but balanced his criticism with praise, citing a police Col. <PERSON> Filipov </PERSON> who he said blocked a mob from attacking a bus. Soldiers and internal security forces sent to <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> to quell the violence succeeded without firing their weapons, he said. <PERSON> Demidov </PERSON> said the death toll of 32 was correct, and repeated the government and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> claims the rioting was instigated by criminal elements.

<TEXT>
 Chinese authorities do not plan to reopen <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> to the thousands of backpackers who streamed through before pro-independence protests began last year, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. `` The thrust of the message is <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is open and they intend to keep it open but they intend to keep it -LRB- travel -RRB- in groups,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state, on Monday. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> said that in talks with authorities during a four-day visit to <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, they did `` not rule out'' the possibility of further unrest in the region's capital, <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. He said he carried no message from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government but expressed concern for human rights in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and pressed authorities to allow more journalists and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen to visit. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> said he did not discuss Chinese conditions for the return of the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s spiritual and former political leader, who fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1959. Individual travel into <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> officially was halted shortly after three protests in September and October by <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and others opposed to Chinese rule. Enforcement of the provision that all tourists to <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> join guided tour groups slackened early this year but has tightened since a protest March 5 in which at least five people died. Chinese authorities alleged after the protests in September and October that some foreigners joined in or encouraged participants. In 1987, 43,500 foreigners visited <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, spending $ 15 million, according to official figures. Many arrived individually from <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or overland from <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> said authorities told him future travelers would be required to travel in groups charging at least $ 27 per day for expenses. Such a restriction probably will discourage travel by youthful backpackers on tight budgets who in the past often spent one or two months at a time in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> mingling with Tibetans without close official supervision. He said there were `` at most a handful'' of foreigners in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> while he was there, Wednesday through Sunday. The Western-managed Lhasa Hotel, with 476 rooms, has had only about two dozen guests at a time since the protests began, he said. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> said local authorities claimed tourism had increased 133 percent in the first quarter of 1988, with 1,184 visitors. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> was not heavily patrolled by armed police, and he encountered no roadblocks. `` The general impression is one of surface normality, but you did n't have to dig deep to find views that there was ... potential for future problems,'' he said. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> said that when he raised the issue of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern over reported human rights violations in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, `` the response was that we and the Chinese have differing views on the human rights question.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has denounced any criticism of its human rights policy as interference in its internal affairs. It acknowledges holding some political prisoners in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, but denies charges they are mistreated or that religious rights are not respected. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> said authorities responded positively to his request that more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen be allowed to visit <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. Four visited <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> on April 7. He said officials told him journalists were allowed to visit if they apply for permission. In practice, almost all reporters' requests to visit <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> have been denied since last year's protests, when 14 foreign journalists were expelled from Chinese Communist troops entered <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in 1950, ending a theocracy headed by the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>.

 A federal judge imposed a 14-year sentence on the political boss of a mountain coal mining county for conspiracy as the county sheriff pleaded guilty to buying his job for $ 100,000. `` I despise your acts of public corruption,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haden </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said Monday while giving a maximum sentence to former <ORGANIZATION> Mingo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, a former sheriff who admitted selling his job to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Eddie'' <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> resigned Monday and pleaded guilty to three felony counts in a plea bargain, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said. He faces up to 13 years in prison and $ 351,000 in fines. <PERSON> Haden </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> to five years in prison plus a $ 10,000 fine on a conspiracy charge and three years each on three tax evasion counts. All sentences are to be served consecutively, <PERSON> Haden </PERSON> said, adding that to give a lighter sentence would `` minimize the seriousness of your activity.'' `` You sold that office. ... That is in and of itself a monstrous crime,'' <PERSON> Haden </PERSON> told <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty. `` There's no way to sugar-coat that and say it should be understood in the context of <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.'' The county is known historically as the site of the Hatfield-McCoy feud and is at the center of political corruption and drug trafficking in which nearly 50 public officials or employees in southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> have been charged or convicted in the last two years. `` If ever this cycle of corruption breeding corruption is to be stopped, it has to be stopped with some signal event that will tell the people of <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> who were slaves to the system that they are free,'' <PERSON> Haden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> also faces sentencing today in state court on two more charges in connection with the same case. His plea agreement indicates that those state sentences will be served at the same time as the federal sentences. <PERSON> Haden </PERSON> set <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>'s sentencing for June 13 in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>, 45, pleaded guilty to mail fraud for backdating a motorcycle accident report to protect an uninsured driver, failure to report income he later used to purchase the sheriff's job, and conspiracy to purchase the sheriff's job and use it to assist relatives and business associates in illegal activities. Also sentenced Monday was former county <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty earlier this year to one count each of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to deliver, obstruction of justice and defrauding the government. <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON>, 47, of <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> was sentenced to 12 years in prison, just three years short of the maximum sentence, fined $ 2,000 and ordered to repay the <ORGANIZATION> EOC </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-poverty agency, an amount yet to be determined by federal auditors. The former <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school board member also was indicted two weeks ago, along with 14 other county political figures, on charges of trying to control the 1984 county election by channeling large amounts of money into <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' political organization.

<HEAD>Police Use Tear Gas To Break Up Student Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of high school students who demonstrated in support of the `` <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six,'' a group of blacks waging a court battle to escape the gallows. Police said tear gas was fired after youths outside a secondary school threw stones at police vehicles in <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Plain, a large township for mixed-race people outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. Journalists said police ordered the protesters to leave and used tear gas and batons to disperse other students marching to the meeting. No injuries or arrests were reported in Monday's clash. Boycotts of classes were reported at mixed-race and black schools throughout the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> area. Some boycotters reportedly protested the suspension of teachers while others supported the <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>, five men and a woman convicted of complicity in the 1984 mob killing of black town councilor. The fate of the six is in limbo while their lawyers seek to reopen the trial to consider claims that police coerced a state witness. <PERSON> P.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zyl </PERSON>, registrar of the <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said on Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> attorney general's office was studying the application to reopen the trial. He said a decision would be made by April 27. A one-month stay of execution was granted March 17, a day before the six had been sentenced to hang. The stay would have expired Monday but was extended indefinitely last Friday when defense lawyers submitted the application. Many Western and Soviet-block governments have sent appeals for mercy for the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has refused to commute the death sentences, saying he wo n't interfere in the judicial process. No evidence was produced that the defendants contributed physically to the councilor's death. They were convicted under the doctrine of `` common purpose,'' which held them responsible for being part of the mob that committed the killing during anti-apartheid riots. Apartheid is <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of racial segregation whereby the minority 5 million whites control the government and the economy and the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Jackson Popularity Doesn't Translate Into Senate
Delegates</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s popularity in the Democratic presidential primaries has n't translated into a single vote from the party delegates in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Pose the question `` why'' to a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> member of that all-white group, and you'll get a look as though you asked why it does n't snow here in July. It's not group racism, lawmakers and analysts say. It's practical politics `` A member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has to look at it and see what's in it for him,'' says <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, a columnist and observer of internal congressional politics. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats send 43 delegates to the party's national convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. They are among the so-called super delegates, who serve by virtue of their positions as party leaders or elected officials. Of the 32 delegates picked in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> so far, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has nine; Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has five; Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who mothballed his campaign, has two, and 16 are uncommitted. Although <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is second in the overall delegate race to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he has zero. It can be a sensitive topic. Incumbent senators take a hard-nosed view of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s chances of actually becoming president. Backing a losing ticket would be of no help to their own re-election chances _ or for the Democrats retaining control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's a strong feeling that we've got to elect a president,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., who is committed to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` We need to do all we can to come up with the best possible slate,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, D-N. He's uncommitted, but says `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has certainly shown he has support. That has to be a major factor.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, who studies government at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, says some senators may have concluded that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` has the capacity to excite blocs of voters in primaries but he'd have an extremely difficult time being elected in a general election. `` I think you'd find any number of members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> embrace another black candidate,'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said, mentioning as an example an elected public official such as Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is supporting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Sen. <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga., who beat a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> incumbent two years ago with the help of strong black support, is among the uncommitted `` I have n't sensed any -LRB- racial -RRB- prejudice,'' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said, pointing out the large number of uncommitteds. `` The whole concept of super delegates is if the public has not made up their minds, then we come into play,'' he said. `` I think most senators want this situation to go away. It's a choice they do n't want to make,'' said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. `` It's a choice between the people you want to keep in your camp and the people you need to get in your camp to win. The Jewish community ... was very much alienated by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s remarks in the past.'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said the senators are `` caught both ways.'' `` They could be hurt politically by being prominently associated with any kind of a stop <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> movement,'' he said. The hope for senators is that the public will make a candidate the inevitable nominee soon so the super delegates can simply ratify the popular choice. With few primaries left, a big win for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in today's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> contest could lead many senators to conclude that the public choice has been made. `` I think if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> manages to win ... the political conditions will be created for the vast bulk of super delegates to end up in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp in time for a first-ballot victory,'' said <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>. `` If he wins the primary by a significant margin, it's all over,'' said <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>. What if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> surprises <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>? `` They're going to keep their powder dry certainly until the convention,'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. -- - EDITOR'S NOTE _ <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Komarow </PERSON> covers politics in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government-controlled media has barely mentioned that Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is visiting <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, the highest-ranking <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader to visit <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 29 years, said before leaving for the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation on Monday night that he hoped the trip would bring Cubans closer to God. `` I ask that you remember me in your prayers, that my trip to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> may bring our brothers and sisters there closer to <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and His Blessed Mother,'' he said Monday in a written statement in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The archdiocese of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> provided reporters with copies of the statement. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> spent two days in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and plans to arrive in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> today, after spending the night in the city of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. There has been no mention of the cardinal's trip in the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION>. A four-paragraph story appeared Sunday in <ORGANIZATION> Juventud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rebelde </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Rebel Youth -RRB-, the newspaper of the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was invited to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> by the country's bishops to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Rev. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Varela </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> priest who spent many years in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and became vicar general of the archdiocese. <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who came to power in 1959 and established a communist government, recently has eased restrictions on religious activities in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation. There was no word on whether <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> would get to talk to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> during his four-day visit. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> addressed an AIDS conference in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> with a plea that victims of the incurable disease be treated with compassion and dignity. `` We have 17 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> hospitals in the archdiocese of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' the Roman Catholic prelate said. `` I have personally urged that any person coming to any one of these hospitals seeking assistance because of the possibility of AIDS be treated with absolute, total and unconditional dignity.'' `` I spend many nights in one of those hospitals, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clare </PERSON>'s,'' visiting AIDS patients, he said. `` Often, I empty their bedpans, comb their hair or mop their brow ... I have realized more and more that every single one is a sacred human person made in the image and likeness of almighty God.'' Following his address at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>, the 68-year-old <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> flew by private plane to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Cuban Archbishop <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in a newsletter made available Monday that <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s visit underlines the `` brotherly'' relations between Roman Catholic churches in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. To worshipers, he said, there is no such thing as one church being more `` influential'' or `` powerful'' than another. `` These adjectives have been taken from the language of international politics and translated without thought sometimes to church relations,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. Catholics account for 41 percent of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s 10.2 million people, as compared with 92 percent of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s 6.6 million people.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> aid workers can resume drought relief operations in the war-torn north but that more than 50 other Western workers remain barred from the region, an official said today. The policy reversal, which affects only four of 60 Western relief workers, came after a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy met during the weekend with President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> and the nation's highest relief official, <PERSON> Berhanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jembere </PERSON>. Undersecretary <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> was sent to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to discuss the April 6 expulsions, which have crippled a massive emergency program to feed 3.2 million starving people in the northern provinces of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre. <PERSON> Tafari </PERSON> <PERSON> Wossen </PERSON>, information officer of the government <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials `` are definitely strengthening their operation there.'' In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Wossen </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Berhanu </PERSON> as saying the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> was never really included in the pullout of aid workers and that `` it must have been a misunderstanding.'' But the four <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> employees were among 60 foreign aid workers the Marxist government ordered out of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last week, <PERSON> Berhanu </PERSON> insisted his government would not allow even a skeleton staff of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> or other Western aid workers to moitor food distribution in the north. Two of the expelled <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> workers returned today to the Eritrean capital of <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, who also is to visit <LOCATION> Mekelle </LOCATION>, the Tigrean capital. Secessionist rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> claimed on Monday they had killed 300 government troops and captured or wounded 500 more on Sunday and Monday in a big battle 20 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> said they could not immediately comment on the government concession and its efects on the northern relief operation. The government said it was evacuating the foreigners to avoid `` personnel risks.'' But relief officials and Western diplomats accused Ethiopian officials of jeopardizing lives of millions of drought victims and said they believed the government wanted to remove witnesses from the war zone as it prepares for a massive offensive against rebels. <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, a former Italian colony on the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, was administered by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> from World War II until 1952 when it was federated with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution. Rebel groups have been fighting for independence since <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> incorporated it in 1962.

 Officials restored power to most of Quebec today after an outage affected its 6 million residents and extended to parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> province and scattered areas of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, a utility spokesman said. In <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, the outage trapped thousands of people in subways, prompted looting and delayed a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> playoff game. Hydro Quebec, the provincial power utility, said it was not known what caused the blackout, which began at 8:09 p.m. EDT. <PERSON> Jean-Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouinet </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hydro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said in a telephone interview today that power was restored to most of the 6 million residents of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> customers about six hours after the blackout started. <PERSON> Ouinet </PERSON> said he did not know how many people were affected outside the province. The blackout terminated television coverage of the Adams Division opening hockey game between the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadiens </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bruins </ORGANIZATION>. The game at the Montreal Forum was interrupted in the first period but then continued with the use of emergency lights. <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> won 5-2. <PERSON> Ouimet </PERSON> said the breakdown began on a power line between <LOCATION> Churchill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Labrador </LOCATION>, and the Arnaud generating station near <LOCATION> Sept-Iles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. Power was being restored slowly, he said. Hospitals and airports across the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> switched to emergency generators, but reported no major problems. In downtown <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, looters smashed windows at a few stores, but police Sgt. <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Bousquet </PERSON> said looting was not widespread. There were no arrests and no deaths immediately attributed to the blackout. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Volpo </PERSON>, owner of a <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> fur store, said thieves had stolen thousands of dollars worth of merchandise. `` I have a gun with a permit and if somebody tries to be funny with me while I'm here, they better understand the consequences,'' he said. Cities on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> side of the border were not affected because the state does not operate on the same system, according to a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and Gas. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION>, said about 800 homes in the Canaan and <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> areas were blacked out for about an hour. The sale of Canadian hydropower to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has become an important part of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> province's economy.

<HEAD>Baseball Cap Sparks Drive-By Shooting That Leaves 6-Year-Old Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A baseball cap that was the wrong color apparently sparked a drive-by shooting that left a 6-year-old girl dead and four family members wounded, the girl's brother said. `` It started with this hat,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Saucedo </PERSON>, 13, who suffered a minor stomach wound in the attack Sunday night. An argument with suspected gang members who tried to take his blue <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royals </ORGANIZATION> cap apparently prompted the attack, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said Monday after returning to his <LOCATION> Compton </LOCATION> home. `` The guys that jumped me said it was a gang hat and I should give it to them. I said no, I bought it with my own money at the Paramount swap meet and it was mine.'' During a fight with a suspected gang member over the hat Sunday, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s parents called deputies. But the gang members apparently returned. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s sister <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> was struck in the chest and killed by one of about two dozen bullets that ripped through the family's home while they were watching `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' an anti-crime television program, authorities said. The girl's parents, <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Saucedo </PERSON>, 39, and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 39, were wounded and were hospitalized in critical condition today, said sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. Her 7-year-old brother, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, and a cousin were reported in fair condition. Three other family members, including an infant, were unhurt. `` Shootings happen every night. I do n't want to stay here,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s 16-year-old sister, <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, said Monday as she sobbed and clung to a photo of her slain sister. Authorities investigating the attack were seeking two gunman who apparently fired a high-powered rifle and semi-automatic pistol from lime green Cadillac, then fled. `` The investigation so far indicates it was a gang-related retaliation shooting,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, `` although we're not yet sure exactly who it was targeted against.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Saucedo </PERSON> is not known to be a gang member, said Detective R.M. Graves. Meanwhile, Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> warned in a speech Monday that the police department's recent crackdown on gangs, which has included weekend sweeps that have resulted in hundreds of arrests, will continue. `` As mayor, I am resolved that we will not surrender one square inch of people's turf to gangs and drugs,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. `` We are in a war, and the enemy is within _ poisoning our children and our neighborhoods.

<TEXT>
 A court today convicted <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> and sentenced him to 13 years in prison for helping abduct two West Germans in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in hopes of forcing the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government to free his brother, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking suspect <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. The 29-year-old defendant looked dejected after hearing the sentence and slumped into his chair. He made no comment. Presiding Judge <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Arend </PERSON> said <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was guilty of the charges of kidnapping, coercion and possession of explosives. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, one of two West Germans kidnapped in the week after <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s arrest, has been freed. <PERSON> Arend </PERSON> appealed for the release of the second, businessman <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, who has been held since Jan. 17, 1987. `` Free <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and show the world your own humanity,'' the judge said. He condemned terrorism, saying: `` Terrorists work to bend other people to their will.'' <PERSON> Arend </PERSON> said that after <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s arrest at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport in January 1987, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> talked by telephone with people in the Lebanese capital, including another brother, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. `` After the capture of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> these men formed a circle in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> who decided to do something to block the possible extradition -LRB- to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Arend </PERSON> said. In testimony at the trial, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> police said they had monitored telephone calls made by <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for several years. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> security chief of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, a radical pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moselm </ORGANIZATION> group that is believed to be an umbrella for the groups holding 22 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The 13-year prison sentence came as a surprise because prosecutors had asked only for a sentence of 11 -LCB- years. Throughout the trial that began Jan. 5, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> denied having anything to do with the kidnappings. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> participated in the abductions in an attempt to force the West German government to release <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who is being held on charges stemming from the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days in the hijacking. Defense attorney <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeller </PERSON> told the court last week that <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> did not contest the explosives charges against him and recommended that he be sentenced to one year in prison. But <PERSON> Hoeller </PERSON> said his client should be freed because he had served more than a year in investigative custody. Federal agents testified during the trial that <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s fingerprints were found on a letter <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> wrote to his mother while he was being held hostage Federal prosecutor <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnarr </PERSON> said in his closing arguments that evidence did not link <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> directly to the gunmen who abducted the Germans, but he said the defendant played a role after the kidnappings. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport on Jan. 13, 1987 while carrying liquid explosives. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on Jan. 26, 1987. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was charged in February with murder, hijacking, hostage-taking and other crimes connected to the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking. After his arrest, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admitted helping his brother hide liquid explosives near <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Saarland </LOCATION> state. The coercion charge against <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> stemmed from his attempt to force the West German government to reject a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition request for his brother. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> denied the request last year, but promised that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> would be put on trial in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Last week, a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> state court said a juvenile court would hear <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s case because he may have been under age 21 when the hijacking was being planned. The juvenile court could still decide to try <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> as an adult.

 A nasty legal fight that pitted <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s son and a group of business associates against the founders of a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> savings and loan has ended with an out-of-court settlement. In a joint statement issued Monday, the settlement with the dissident shareholders was called `` economically attractive to the shareholders, and operationally prudent for the Fensters,'' the founding family. The family, which now owns 24.9 percent of the stock in <ORGANIZATION> Oceanmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, will acquire the 37 percent interest in the institution owned by <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and his associates.

Under the agreement, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenster </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> will be reinstated as acting chairwoman of the board.

I regret any personal hardship this purely business dispurt may have caused Mr. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. I have always considered him an outstanding professional.'' The parties and their attorneys agreed, as part of the settlement, that they would have no further comment on the settlement or its terms, which are subject to the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The Fensters founded the thrift in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> in 1986. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenster </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> filed suit in December against some dissident shareholders of <LOCATION> Oceanmark </LOCATION>, charging that thay had moved to assume control of the institution without going through proper federal channels. After Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> filed suit, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> countersued, accusing her of libel and defamation. `` The settlement will allow us to return to the business of the thrift,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, the largest minority shareholder and a <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> associate, said that `` two years ago, we thought that we could all work together to build a strong institution.'' `` Unfortunately, sometimes even relationships forged with the best of intentions do n't work out,'' said the <LOCATION> Rockland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, real estate developer. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, 30, is a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> lawyer who also has been his father's chief political adviser since the elder <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s successful run for governor in 1982.

<HEAD>Nuclear Arms Policy Prompts Political Crisis in Denmark</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The prime minister today called parliamentary elections to resolve a political crisis over the country's ban on peacetime nuclear weapons. Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> said a more strictly enforced ban, which the leftist opposition approved last week, `` goes beyond the limit where <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s full membership in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is put in danger.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, fellow members of the military alliance, have criticized the tighter ban. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has threatened to forgo <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> maneuvers in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, who heads a governing center-right coalition, called the elections for May 10. In the latest elections in September, his four-party coalition lost seven seats to control 70 of the parliament's 179 members. It has kept enough support on economic issues to command a majority but lost 23 votes on defense issues since <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> took office in 1982. The opposition's new policy requires the government to notify visiting warships that nuclear weapons are banned in Danish ports. Until now, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> has simply announced a general policy and assumed individual foreign vessels were observing it. Defense Minister <PERSON> Bernt </PERSON> <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collet </PERSON> has said the reinforced ban would be put in abeyance until after the election. The new ban fell short of measures adopted by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> demanding that ship captains affirm their vessels have no nuclear weapons. That policy prompted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to break off military cooperation with the south <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> nation. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> said today <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had vowed to bow out of military maneuvers to practice reinforcing <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> in wartime because it would have to disclose whether its ships carried nuclear weapons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Friday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was `` deeply distressed'' with the new Danish ban. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of never disclosing the presence of nuclear weapons `` is central to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ability to fulfill its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> commitments. We are not going to change it.'' <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> also said the Danish action could have `` extremely serious consequences'' for the 16-nation alliance.

 There's something missing from the carved marble figure of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> on the 60-foot shrine to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> heroes that stands in front of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>. It's the tip of his nose. The disfigured face of <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>, among the best known of the 189 defenders of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, was discovered Monday when members of a wreath-bearing procession took part in an event known as the Pilgrimage to the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>. Repairs are expected to begin in two weeks, after a grandstand is removed from <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>, officials say. The solution? Glue.

It just needs to be glued back on,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. Long said the tip can be glued with ordinary epoxy cement. Marble dust will be mixed with the cement to fill in gaps.

<TEXT>
 A flaming engine blamed for the crash-landing of a <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> turboprop last week had emitted a strong odor of fuel before an earlier flight, an investigator said. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nall </PERSON>, heading the investigation of Friday's accident here, also discussed other engine problems suffered by de Havilland Dash-8s at a news conference Monday night. The crash-landing injured 19 of the 40 people aboard as it smashed into a passenger ramp at Seattle-Tacome International Airport. The plane was one of 10 Dash-8s in the Horizon fleet. Pilot <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> also told investigators of a maintenance log entry April 8, a week before Friday night's crash, that described a strong fuel odor coming from the same engine that caught fire Friday night, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. `` There was some maintenance done and nobody complained of the smell after -LRB- the April 8 report -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> noted that in 1987 an engine fire in a <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Havilland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dash-8 </ORGANIZATION> had forced an emergency landing. And <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators that a different Dash-8 turboprop he was flying earlier this month suffered a brief power loss in one of its <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> engines. <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said although the engine immediately regained power, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> aborted that flight and landed. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> told the safety board he understood from other pilots that such a problem `` was not uncommon but it was certainly not a regular occurrence,'' he said. `` The investigation is obviously intense at this point,'' <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. The June 1987 engine fire aboard involved fuel spilled into the engine cowling and forced the plane, which had taken off from <LOCATION> Sea-Tac </LOCATION>, to make an emergency landing at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. Horizon Air changed maintenance procedures after that fire, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said, adding, `` We do n't know at this point if the -LRB- June'87 and the latest fire -RRB- are related.'' `` ... The direction and focus of the investigation is obviously to determine why there was the fuel in the right -LRB- cowling over the engine -RRB- _ passengers noted there was fuel there before the crash _ and the cause of the ignition of that fuel,'' <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said. Passengers in the plane that crashed Friday told investigators they could see fuel accumulated on the right wing. The Dash-8 engine is made by <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NSTB </ORGANIZATION> planned to take a long, hard look at all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes with similar engines. Horizon Air President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said Monday that airline crews checked engines on the company's fleet of Dash-8s, but found no problems that would have led to a fire like the one that preceded Friday night's crash. Three of the 19 injured passengers remained hospitalized Monday.

<TEXT>
 American evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> today praised <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leaders, saying they are working to broaden freedom of religion in their country. `` There's no complacency here that I've found among the leaders,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who is taking his first trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` They admit that there are serious problems in implementing the constitutional guarantee of freedom and something must be done about it.'' The 69-year-old evangelist, who has taken his religious message to more than 60 countries, made today's comments to foreign reporters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who has preached while in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and held talks with leaders, praised the country's leadership for recognizing shortcomings in defending the rights of believers and acknowledging that religion can play a role in the moral development of the nation. During the first three decades of communist rule in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, places of worship were destroyed and believers persecuted. Religion suffered especially during the 1966-76 ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution. The government now guarantees religious freedom, but it allows only state-sanctioned religious groups and forbids prosyletizing. Chinese religious officials say there are about 4 million members of the state-approved <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> church and more than 3 million Catholics affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Thousands of unaffiliated believers are also thought to worship at home. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who on Sunday preached to more than 1,500 worshipers in a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Protestant church, said he felt there was `` a possibility of a very positive turn of events for believers in this country.'' `` I seem to sense here that there is a desire on the part of leaders for a moral and spiritual rebirth or rejuvenation, something to give purpose and meaning to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today.'' During his week in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> has met religious leaders, scholars, students and government officials, including Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> confirmed an official Chinese report that quoted <PERSON> Li </PERSON> as saying that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> needs spiritual as well as material development to prosper. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> declined to say whether he discussed with officials the issue of Christians and other believers who have been imprisoned for their religious activities. Catholics in particular have been jailed for defying the government policy of cutting all ties to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said he was told religious leaders are holding discussions on drafting a law on religion and the state. `` This would help diminish both official and popular attitudes of intolerance and discrimination,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. He was to leave <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> today for coastal <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> province to visit the village where his wife <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, the daughter of missionaries, was born and spent her youth. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was also scheduled to speak at a Christian seminary in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> and preach at a church in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. He will visit <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> before leaving <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on April 28.

 Security at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> has been tightened because of clashes between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces and Iranian forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of staff said no <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> personnel were being alerted for combat duty. Residents and personnel on the base have been asked to be alert to `` suspicious and inquisitive strangers,'' unidentified vehicles and abandoned cars or packages, and to keep unused areas around home and work secured. `` This is FORSCOM-wide,'' Maj. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON>, public affairs officer for the 101st Airborne Division, said Monday. `` We have not been singled out,'' FORSCOM, or the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, directs the activities of about 950,000 active and reserve troops, about two-thirds of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s ground combat forces. <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON> said he did not know of any specific threats to military installations that might have caused the extra precautions. Gen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vuono </PERSON>, on a routine visit to the base to assess the readiness and training of the troops here, declined Monday to speculate if there was a possibility Army personnel might be called to combat. `` There are no plans to deploy the 101st to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>,'' he said, adding that the Army could execute any mission and that soldiers are `` ready to go on a continuous basis.'' Only <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and Marine Forces have been involved in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> action so far.

<HEAD>Federally Mediated Talks Last 20 Minutes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Contract negotiations between scriptwriters and producers broke off again after a meeting with a federal mediator and no new talks are scheduled in the six-week-old strike. Each side accused the other of intransigence Monday. The deadlock could affect the networks' announcement next month of their fall schedules, with production of new shows and their pilot episodes thrown into question. The Writers Guild of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> had requested a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, which the guild struck on March 7 over issues of residual fees from foreign markets and hourlong shows sold into syndication. `` They had nothing new to offer. They said, ` We have no change in our position,''' alliance spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said of Monday's meeting. `` They just called the meeting to tell us that. I do n't understand it.'' But Guild spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said the alliance, representing about 200 studios and producers, insisted that writers accept their final offer from March 6, the day before the 9,000-member union struck. `` At a time when the industry is at a standstill, the guild regrets the companies' unwillingness to deal seriously with writers' proposals and to continue to negotiate,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. She said the session presided over by federal mediator <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> lasted only 20 minutes. Until writers are willing to discuss the producers' final offer, `` We saw no reason to continue the meeting, or to schedule another meeting,'' said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. Producers have said several times that they are standing by their final offer. The alliance has said its proposal would raise writers' pay by $ 50 million over three years, even though it would reduce residual payments for some one-hour TV shows. Writers say their own analysis of the offer shows it would result in a loss of more than $ 37.8 million for its members. The strike has caused several television shows, such as `` Moonlighting,'' `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' and `` The Cosby Show,'' to fall three or four shows shy of a full seaso3ptk

 A cafeteria that fired an employee for having an `` extreme'' hairdo refuses to re-hire her despite a formal complaint filed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` If her hairstyle is in conformity with our policy, then she can have her job back,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, an attorney for Mobile, Ala.-based <ORGANIZATION> Morrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which fired <ORGANIZATION> Renee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Randall </ORGANIZATION> April 4 from its <ORGANIZATION> Morrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cafeteria </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, 19, says she had been told not to return to work until she changed her long ponytail `` cornrow'' hairstyle. `` Not only is this policy ridiculous but it is discriminatory against blacks,'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Comstock-Gay </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> chapter said at a news conference Monday to announce the complaint filed with the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` It ay not be intended to be racism, but black girls are the only ones who wear this style.'' Ms. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, 19, wears her hair in tightly braided cornrows with a ponytail in the back, <PERSON> Comstock-Gay </PERSON> said in an interview. `` The fall-back part is a black-red, black-orange _ there is a slightly different hue to it.'' Fountain said by telephone that the company objects to the ponytail, not to Ms. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>'s cornrows. `` Apparently it was the ponytail that was standing on her head about six or eight inches,'' <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said. `` And the color of the hair was different than that of her normal hair, which combined to make the hairdo extreme.'' Fountain said another employee in the <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION> store has a cornrow hairstyle that is acceptable. Ms. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> said she knew of no customers who had complained about her hairdo before she was removed from her job. She paid for the hairstyle and she should n't be forced to change it to please her employer, she said. `` She certainly wants her job back and we're going to try to convince -LRB- <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s Cafeteria -RRB- to give her her job back,'' <PERSON> Comstock-Gay </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> has not talked with <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> management since she was told to leave April 4, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Morrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> operates more than 150 cafeterias, primarily in the South and East, <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Comstock-Gay </PERSON> said if the complaint before the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> runs its full course, it may be six months or longer before a decision is rendered. `` I think she may have to look for -LRB- another job -RRB-,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, trying to end confusion over his position on fighting in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, said today the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` was appropriate under the circumstances.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, who was looking for a victory in today's presidential primary to propel him toward the nomination, greeted subway commuters in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> and stopped for a visit at the T-Bone Diner before returning to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made a brief statement to reporters on the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> situation but took no questions on the issue during a news conference on the steps of the diner. On Monday he had told one reporter he considered the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action a `` measured response'' but then refused to comment at two news conferences. `` Based on the facts that I have, I think the president took the appropriate action,'' he said today. `` It was a measured response.'' He said it was `` a responsibility of the international community to do something about'' the long Iran-Iraq war in the region. He mentioned an embargo on shipments of arms. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign `` a wonderful experience.'' `` I hope I can do well today and win today, and I hope I can come back as the nominee,'' he said. `` It's been a terrific, exciting, interesting couple of weeks and I hope if all goes well today a sign of things to come.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was returning to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for the day before traveling to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Dinner in the evening, an event held one week before <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s presidential primary. He planned to return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to be with supporters when the state's primary returns are counted tonight. Campaigning back and forth across the state on the eve of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s primary, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner generally refused to speak with reporters about the quickly changing developments in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. But aides confirmed he told one reporter early in the day that he considered the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack on the platforms a `` measured response,'' language considered supportive of the action. When reporters traveling with him asked for explanations, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declined to come talk to them on the plane and sent two aides to respond instead. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Albright </PERSON>, campaign foreign policy adviser, said that because events were shifting so rapidly, `` he felt he did n't want to continue with the initial statement.'' Asked if he had withdrawn the statement or stood by it, she said, `` A combination of several series of escalations makes one question whether it was an appropriate reaction.'' As he departed his campaign jet a final time in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Monday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned away from a reporter who asked about the issue. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> referred the questions to campaign press secretary <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, who had already told reporters, `` Given how the story has developed, he's withholding comment.'' The 11th-hour flap came against a backdrop of caution by the candidate, who could go a long way toward the nomination with a victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and following a campaign in which rival <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor of displaying foreign policy inexperience. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> urged crowds throughout his final full day of campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to ignore polls showing him in the lead and to help get other supporters out to vote, saying turnout would be the deciding factor. `` I pay no attention to polls, and I hope you pay no attention to polls,'' he told college students in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>. At a lunchtime rally in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared with his actress cousin <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and spoke optimistically. `` Here on the eve of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, I just want to say to all of you that I'm grateful for your support, grateful for all you've done, and we're looking forward to a great victory tomorrow here in the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and we're going to get it,'' he said.

 A man who once punched a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice to protest pornography is facing trial on felony charges of aggravated sexual abuse of a child and showing harmful material to a child. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>, 62, <LOCATION> Kaysville </LOCATION>, was bound over for trial following a hearing Monday before 4th Circuit Judge <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>. The charges, filed Jan. 25, involve an 11-year-old girl who worked as a housekeeper at the <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> home. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> is charged with showing the girl pictures of nude people and asking her to assume the same poses. The girl said that on one occasion, <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> removed her clothes, fondled her and gave her an extra $ 5 in wages, court documents said. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> recently asked Bean to drop the charges because news coverage of his previous and current court involvement was damaging his ability to make a living in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. He asked the charges be dropped so he could sell his house and move out of the state. The judge said it was not appropriate for him to be involved in negotiations of this type. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> was fined $ 500 and sentenced to 10 days in jail and two years probation after he punched Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> three times during a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> State Bar convention in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on July 15, 1982. White suffered a minor abrasion of the cheek. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> said the attack was to protest court rulings on pornography and school busing. `` He's causing four-letter words to come into my living room through the TV set. The only way I know how to stop it is to go to the source,'' he told reporters at the time.

However, their conduct was contradictory to established standards of conduct and specifically violated <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> policy on homosexuality,'' <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> operates under a policy that `` homosexuality is incompatible with military service,'' and the uniform code makes homosexuality a crime. The women, discharged Friday, were the first released as a result of the investigation, which started in December and primarily involves the Fourth Recruit Training Battalion, where all female recruits are trained. Five other women have been charged with indecent acts and are involved in criminal proceedings. A hearing for one of those women, Cpl. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, concluded Monday when a <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy testified he found his former girlfriend, a Marine, in bed with Ms. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, has been charged with indecent acts with women, sodomy and obstruction of justice. She has been suspended from her military police duties at the depot. After reviewing testimony from the two-day hearing, the hearing officer will make a non-binding recommendation of action to Ms. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>'s commanding officer. Recommendations could range from a court-martial to no action.

<HEAD>Court Says Development of California Forest Does Not Violate
Indian Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's planned development of part of the Six Rivers National Forest in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> does not violate Indians' religious rights, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today by a 5-3 vote. The court's dissenters said the ruling `` leaves Native Americans with absolutely no constitutional protection from perhaps the gravest threat to their religious practices.'' The decision revived the federal government's plans to harvest timber in one section of the forest and to upgrade a road linking the towns of <PERSON> Gasquet </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. A federal appeals court had ruled that such development would represent a constitutionally impermissible interference with the religious rights of three Indian tribes. But writing for the high court today, Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said, `` Even if we assume -LRB- the development -RRB- will virtually destory the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' ability to practice their religion, the Constitution simply does not provide a principle that could justify upholding -LRB- their -RRB- legal claims.'' Six Rivers, encompassing about 956,000 acres in northwestern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was designated a national forest in 1947. The portion of the forest involved in the legal dispute is in a region between the <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Klamath </LOCATION> rivers known as the `` high country.'' It is considered sacred by the Yurok, <PERSON> Karok </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tolowa </PERSON> tribes. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has proposed upgrading a 75-mile road between <PERSON> Gasquet </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to accommodate the hauling of timber and to enhance public access to that part of the forest. Twenty miles of the road is located on non-federal land and is maintained by <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. According to government lawyers, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has spent about $ 17 million upgrading 49 of the road's 55 miles over federal land. But a six-mile stretch of the road, in the <LOCATION> Chimney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> section of the forest, remains unpaved and is accessible only six months a year. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> plans to complete the road and allow the harvesting of timber in the `` high country'' region were challenged by members of the three tribes, various environmental groups and state authorities. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 found that `` the high country is indispensible to a significant number of Indian healers and religious leaders as a place where they receive the ` power' that permits them to fill their religious roles that are central to the traditional religions.'' Although the development would not intrude on any sites of Indian religious ceremonies, the appeals court said the development indirectly would `` produce an irreparable impact.'' In enacting the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Wilderness Act of 1984, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> designated most of <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rivers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> as a wilderness area. Since commercial activities are prohibited in such areas, timber harvesting generally is banned. But the 1984 law exempted a narrow stretch of land from the wilderness designation `` to enable the completion of the Gasquet-Orleans road project if the responsible authorities so decide.'' In rejecting the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' religious-freedom argument, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said that `` nothing in our opinion should be read to encourage governmental insensitivity to the religious needs of any citizen.'' `` The government's rights to the use of its own land, for example, need not and should not discourage it from accommodating religious practices like those engaged in by the Indians.'' She noted that government officials had `` taken numerous steps in this very case to minimize the impact that construction of the road will have on the Indians' religious activities. Voting with <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> were Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> dissented. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not participate in the case. Writing for the dissenters, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the court's ruling `` essentially leaves Native Americans with absolutely no constitutional protection against perhaps the gravest threat to their religious practices.'' `` I find it difficult to imagine conduct more insensitive to religious needs than the government's determination to build a marginally useful road in the face of uncontradicted evidence that the road will render the practice of -LRB- the Indians' -RRB- religion impossible,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. The case is <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, 86-1013.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> hailed a victory in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> as the `` hors d'oeuvre'' before today's presidential feast in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hoped the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary results would be `` a sign of things to come'' and make him the clear front-runner Democrats have sought. Turnout in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was described as quite heavy as voting began on a cool, dry day. At an East Harlem polling place, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his victory over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> caucuses Monday night `` is another evidence of how broad our support is. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> was the hors d'oeuvre, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is a four-course meal.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gtreeted commuters at a <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> subway stop and said, `` I hope I can do well today and win today, and I hope I can come back as the nominee. It's been a terrific, exciting, interesting couple of weeks and I hope if all goes well today, a sign of things to come.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, also seeking to end confusion over his position on the fighting in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was `` appropriate under the circumstances.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made a brief statement to reporters on the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> situation but took no questions on the issue. On Monday, he told one reporter he considered the action a `` measured response,'' then refused to comment at two news conferences. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, needing a surprise showing to salvage his debt-ridden candidacy, shook hands with commuters arriving in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. With strong support from the state's large black electorate, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was hoping for an upset that would allow him to claim the status as front-runner. <PERSON> Bea </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolen </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION>, described turnout as quite heavy throughout the city. She predicted it would top 50 percent and said, `` I'll have to wait and see later if it goes above 60.'' About 2.5 million of the state's 3.5 million eligible Democratic voters live in the city. Pollsters, while saying the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had a lead of anywhere from 10 to 17 points, also were warning about the volatility of the race. `` We could all be wrong. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is a killer,'' said ABC News pollster <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. Heading into the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> race, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> scored a win in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s Democratic caucuses Monday night, beating <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 45 percent to 27 percent. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had just 2 percent. But the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> contest was dwarfed by the big <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, with its prize of 255 Democratic delegates. Untroubled by any doubts about his grasp on the Republican presidential nomination, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expected to sweep the 96 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates at stake today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. For <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> offered an opportunity to break away from his pursuers and finally establish himself as the front-runner as the race moves on to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> next Tuesday and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> the week after that. The latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegate count gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 877, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 745, and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 417. A total of 2,082 was needed for a convention majority. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign was marked by an emphasis on candidate views on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and by the long shadows of two non-candidates _ Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. Turnout in today's polling was critical, and all three Democratic contenders spent the final hours of campaigning urging their supporters to go to the polls. `` If you stand in the rain today, you will vote in the rain tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told supporters in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> on a wet Monday. `` We've come too close; nothing can stop us now.'' `` Just do n't forget to vote tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told his backers. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaigned with <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, whose attacks on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> often got more attention than the sparring between the candidates. During the campaign, the mayor said Jews and other supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` would have to be crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> also said the former civil rights activist lied under pressure and would lead the Democrats to their worst defeat since 1972, when Republican <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> carried 49 states. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> was asked repeatedly about his weekend comments criticizing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I'm not saying he's a liar. I'm saying he ca n't stand stress, and then he lies under stress,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tried to avoid being drawn into a running battle with <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, but said at a news conference Monday that `` we have received more death threats in this campaign than in all the other combined because the climate has been so divisive and so violent.'' `` The name-calling and the accusations and the attempts of a provocation by the mayor have not been good for the city or the campaign,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who praised all three contenders but endorsed none, said that <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s tactic of `` attacking <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s character'' might boomerang. `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is not getting enough whites,'' said pollster <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION>. And he said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> `` does not appear to have gotten into the numbers where he will close the margin.'' Polling Sunday and Monday by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rebounding after losing some ground Friday and Saturday. The combined Sunday-Monday results were: <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 51 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 34 percent and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr. 9 percent. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> survey Saturday and Sunday had a narrower spread, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at 43 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 33 and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> at 12. A Gallup poll done Friday through Sunday put the race at <ORGANIZATION> Dukakis </ORGANIZATION> 45, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 32 and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 10. The ABC-Post poll had a 6-point margin of error, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s 4, Gallup's 5.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of people from around the world joined Polish officials today in offering flowers and prayers to the memory of fallen anti-Nazi warriors of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Jewish Ghetto Uprising. The 45th anniversary ceremony took place on a broad plaza in front of the Ghetto Fighters Monument in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, where the sounds of gunfire echoed on the morning of April 19, 1943. Heavily armed squadrons of German Nazi troops that day entered the walled Jewish quarter bent on quick, final annihilation of the last 70,000 inhabitants. Instead, they were routed, and the starving, poorly armed residents held off Nazi troops for three more weeks. `` We have to remember, yes, but not a paralyzing memory,'' <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Itzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Navon </PERSON> told the crowd of about 4,000 people in English. `` Not only remember the past, but we should derive a new determination from that tragedy to continue living.'' <PERSON> Navon </PERSON>, whose visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is considered private, expressed thanks to Polish authorities for the ceremony. The two countries do not have full-fledged diplomatic relations. Six million Jews were put to death in the World War II Holocaust, 3 million of them Polish. Earlier today, about 100 Arab and African students carrying <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags briefly marched through the city, also to commemorate the Ghetto fighters. The students drew parallels between the ghetto battles and the 4 -LCB- - month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> The protesters distributed leaflets to passers-by, recounting what they said were Israeli cruelties. Before the official ceremony, <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jablonski </PERSON>, chairman of the Polish veteran organization Zbowid which organized the observance, planted an oak tree on the plaza as a symbol of hope. Then, to the beat of military drums, delegations from veterans, Jewish, and Polish groups laid wreath after wreath of flowers at the foot of the monument, a relief of armed fighters crouched together facing their foes. The monument, near the city's heart, was the first erected on the destroyed left bank of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> after the war. As Poles and Israelis stood side by side around the square, a cantor sang Kaddish, the Jewish song of mourning. Rabbi <PERSON> Isser </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> prayed for the victims of the ghetto and the Nazi Holocaust in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Later, when the Polish officials and military honor guard withdrew, Israelis in the crowd burst into singing of their national anthem. About 3,000 people from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and around the world came to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for the observance week, which began Thursday.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> left today for talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to try to eliminate differences in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet drafts of the new arms control treaty to slash long-range nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was scheduled to depart at 8 a.m., but a mechanical problem with his <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet delayed the takeoff until 10:36 a.m.. About half of the 1,200 disputed items identified by American and Soviet negotiators are technical and could be resolved if major verification problems are worked out, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials said Monday But the others have proved intractable so far, involving the detection and counting of elusive mobile and cruise missiles carried on planes and warships, said the officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. Officials acknowledged that hopes were fading for the treaty to be ready for signing at the May 28-June 2 summit meeting in the Soviet capital. `` There's always hope,'' an official said. But he said there has been virtually no progress in resolving differences between the two sides since <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last month with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. The official blamed a lack of cooperation on the Soviet side. `` I ` m not one for bashing the Soviets,'' the official said in an interview. `` But they're not exactly following through on the problems. And look at the calendar.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is flying to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> and will go on to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Thursday for three days of talks with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and a session with General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He will also make stops in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tblisi </LOCATION>, the capitals of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will brief officials of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Monday and then return home. The monthly meetings are in preparation for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> May 29-June 2 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would like to crown his fourth and probably final superpower summit meeting with a treaty to reduce long-range bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 to 50 percent. But a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, briefing reporters under rules of anonymity, said four drafts prepared by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators had 1,200 distinct items of disagreement bracketed. The drafts deal with verifying the reductions, disposing of banned weapons, an exchange of information on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet arsenals and the treaty itself. A fifth and separate draft deals with space-based defenses. `` The longer time goes by without solving these issues, the more unlikely there will be a signing in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' the official said. `` But we'll keep trying.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is insisting on a strict verification system. This requires procedures for monitoring what the other side retains in its arsenal. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also will talk to <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about other subjects including the Iran-Iraq war, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and human rights. Since last July he has tried and failed to persuade the Soviets to join in calling for an international arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in order to force a cease-fire in the 7 -LCB- - year war in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> This has kept the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from pressing the issue in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> since the Soviets have the power to veto any resolution. In the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> wants the Soviets to accept a limited role in a peace conference. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> would prefer the Soviets be active in shaping a settlement, while <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> objects to their involvement since the Soviets usually side with the Arabs in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> disputes. On human rights, the senior official said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would try to make Soviet emigration easier. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants the Soviets to drop a provision for denying a visa if another family member objects and to ease restrictions on applicants involved in sensitive work in the past.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today made it easier for creditors to recover debts owed by dead people. The justices, voting 8-1, revived a claim by an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> bill collection agency that said it unfairly was denied the chance to recover part of a hospital bill owed by a former patient who died. The agency, <ORGANIZATION> Tulsa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is seeking to collect $ 14,657 from the family of the late <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> ran up a $ 142,000 bill at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> from Nov. 23, 1978, until he died the following April 2 Insurance covered all but the amount sought by the bill collector. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>'s family published a newspaper notice to creditors after his will was admitted to probate in July 1979. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> law requires that any creditor claiming money from an estate file such a claim within two months of the probate notice. <ORGANIZATION> Tulsa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which missed the deadline, said it was denied due process because it was not notified directly of the probate proceedings. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today said the agency has a legitimate case. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, in her opinion for the court, said if the Pope family knew about the collection agency or could have determined its identity by a reasonable effort it was required to notify the creditor directly _ by mail, for example _ about the probate proceedings. The court set aside a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in favor of the Pope family and ordered further lower court proceedings to determine whether the Pope family knew the collection agency was owed money or whether the agency's identity was `` reasonably ascertainable.'' Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> dissented. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Tulsa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, 86-1961.

<HEAD>Judges Unhappy With Proposed Sentencing Guidelines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New guidelines designed to eliminate disparity in sentencing will deprive judges of their independence, say some federal jurists who met to consider the issue. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Sentencing Commission, organized in 1984 as an arm of the federal judiciary, adopted the sweeping guidelines last November in an attempt to end the disparities in criminal sentencing. `` They're cold and implacable and as immutable as a computer,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ideman </PERSON>, one of 20 federal judges who met Monday. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, representing the commission, said the guidelines were developed to increase respect for the law by ensuring that defendants are sentenced fairly. He cited a 1974 study of 50 judges that found sentences for the same crime ranged from three to 20 years. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will make the final determination on the guidelines. Several of the judges expressed irritation at the notion of any independent commission fixing sentencing options for federal judges. The guidelines, proposed at <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' direction, established a range of penalties for all federal crimes that occurred after Nov. 1. Minimum and maximum penalties do not vary more than 25 percent and judges are n't permitted to deviate unless a case involves factors not considered by the commission. The controversial guidelines have prompted divided opinions from district judges throughout the country. Opponents have argued that the commission, as an arm of the judicial branch, did not have authority to assume what has been a function of the legislative branch. `` What it does is it destroys all the discretionary function of a judge and it gives an opportunity for prosecutorial misbehavior,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickran </PERSON> <PERSON> Tevrizian </PERSON> said Monday.

 Prosecutors today dismissed charges of marijuana possession against <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON>, the ex-wife of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON> had been charged March 17 after <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> used a search warrant to seize a package at her home. Federal prosecutor <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said a defect in the warrant would have made successful prosecution impossible. A copy of the search warrant used at Ms. <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON>'s home said an informer in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> told police Ms. <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON> would be receiving a pound of marijuana through the mail in eight separate packages. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said the problem with the warrant was that the marijuana was not delivered until sometime after the warrant was signed. He said the pollice officer who requested the warrant had told the court that the marijuana had been received. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said he had decided to drop the charge. `` I am the prosecutor, the one who received the case,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` This was my decision.'' He denied any suggestion that Ms. <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON> received special treatment. `` It has been treated like any other three-dash-one -LRB- possession charge -RRB- as far as is possible,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` I've never seen so much press interest in a three-dash-one.'' Ms. <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON>, 39, did not have to appear in court on the charge. A conviction could have carried a maximum fine of $ 1,000 or six months in jail or both, although lesser penalties are usually imposed. <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> and his wife were divorced in 1983. She married <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> real estate developer Fried Kemper the following year, with whom she has one son.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against Minnesota Welfare Recipients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today ruled against a group of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> welfare recipients who said they were given inadequate notice about a change in their eligibility for federal benefits. The court, voting 5-3, said states are not required to provide advance written notice about the effects of 1981 changes in eligibility requirements of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Under the AFDC program, states determine a family's eligibility after calculating its income and resources. Prior to 1981, when an AFDC recipient received a lump sum of money from any source _ such as an insurance settlement or lottery winnings _ the money was treated as income in the month received and as resources in succeeding months. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 changed that policy in an attempt to discourage quick spending of windfalls, providing that lump-sum income is to be prorated over a period of months. The change generally limits the eligibility after a family receives lump-sum income. A group of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> women who receive <ORGANIZATION> AFDC </ORGANIZATION> benefits sued state authorities in 1983, contending that they were not given advance notice about the lump-sum rule or the 1981 change in that rule. A 37-year-old <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> woman, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, is the lone remaining named plaintiff in the `` class action'' lawsuit. In October 1983, the <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> family received a $ 5,752 disability check. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> bus driver, wrote checks the same day to cover back mortgage payments and an overdue car-repair bill. The family also spent about $ 600 on children's clothing and other items. Although the disability payment was quickly spent, the <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> family was declared ineligible for <ORGANIZATION> AFDC </ORGANIZATION> benefits for eight months. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in late 1986 that imposition of the lump-sum rule on the <ORGANIZATION> Jenkinses </ORGANIZATION> was unfair because no advance notice of the 1981 rule change had been received. Today, the nation's highest court disagreed and gave <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> authorities a legal victory by reversing the appeals court ruling on what a federal notice regulation requires. `` The regulation simply requires the state to publish a general description of the basic structure of the <ORGANIZATION> AFDC </ORGANIZATION> program and its availability,'' Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> wrote for the court. He was joined by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> dissented. Writing for the three, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said she thought the disputed notice regulation `` requires the -LRB- <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> -RRB- Department -LRB- of Human Services -RRB- to give applicants for AFDC benefits written notice at least of the existence of the lump-sum rule and of the need for recipients to consult with a social worker before spending any lump sum they might receive.'' Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not participate in the case. The case is Gardebring vs. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, 86-978.

 Israeli today deported to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> six Palestinians who were involved in a fatal clash with Jewish settlers in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village, the army said. Two other Arabs were expelled from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and flown by an army helicopter to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the army reported. The deportations raised to 20 the number of Palestinians expelled since the start of the Palestinian uprising Dec. 8. More than 1,000 Arabs have been deported since 1967. So far, 167 Palestinians have died in the unrest, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. Two Israelis also have been killed. The army accused the deported Palestinians of inciting and organizing disturbances in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. It said they had appealed to an army review board but did not take their case to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Army officials said the six <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> residents were involved in a stoning attack against 16 Jewish teen-agers and two armed guards from a nearby <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement on April 6. A settler girl and two <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> residents were killed in the clash. An army report said the girl was killed by a bullet fired from the weapon of one of the Jewish guards. The army has destroyed the homes of 13 <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> residents linked to the stoning attack. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, a prominent Palestinian editor, said the deportations were a message that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` wants to continue the occupation and is disregarding Palestinian national rights.'' `` Such a policy will inflame the situation and actually add to the determination of the Palestinian people in their struggle for their national aspirations,'' said <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, editor of the pro-PLO daily newspaper <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fajr </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has condemned deportations, saying the measure violated the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention which bans the transfer across borders of civilians living in occupied zones. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which has not accepted the applicability of the conventions to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, has defended the practice, saying only mass expulsions were barred and that such punishment was less severe than execution, permitted by the conventions. Also today, an Israeli Cabinet minister criticized the slaying of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> commander <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, warning it would backfire on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The army censored a newspaper editorial about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s reported role in the assassination Soldiers sealed off parts of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and clamped a curfew on 17 towns, cities and refugee camps for a third straight day to quell rioting in the occupied territories, the military said. Nineteen Palestinians have been killed since Saturday's slaying of <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, who was second in command to <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Israeli sources have confirmed that Israeli commandos shot and killed <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> at his home in a <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> suburb. The nation's leaders have so far refused to comment. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television reported Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> agents, naval and army commandos carried out the assassination, reaching their target by sea. The report said the operation was approved at a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> meeting last week, with two dissenters, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and Cabinet Minister <PERSON> Ezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>. In an interview with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio today, <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>, a former defense minister, refused to comment on whether <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> onducted the assassination, but said: `` It does n't contribute to the fight against terrorism. In principle it creates more. It distances the peace process and will bring greater hostility and make us more vulnerable around the world.'' <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON>'s body was flown to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> today. His funeral is scheduled for Wednesday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military censor, meanwhile, took a rare step and censored an entire editorial by the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> which </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspaper </ORGANIZATION> sources said dealt with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s role in <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON>'s killing. The editorial appeared as a blank white space with only a title that read: `` They Are Silent But Speak.'' <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Yudkovsky </PERSON>, the newspaper's editor, declined to comment on the action. Also today, the Israeli-appointed mayor of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuqan </PERSON>, declined to comment on media reports that he planned to resign from his post because of the 4 -LCB- - month-long uprising in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupied in the 1967 Middle East War A leaflet published this month by the pro-PLO underground called on Tuqan and other Israeli-appointed municipal officials to leave their jobs. Tuqan stepped in as <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> mayor in March 1986 after Israeli-appointed <PERSON> Zafer </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Masri </PERSON> was assassinated by pro-Syrian extremists. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city with 120,000 residents, and 16 other towns and refugee camps in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> have been under curfew since Sunday. <PERSON> Jelazoun </PERSON>, a Palestinian refugee camp near the city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, has been under curfew for 34 days, the longest curfew on a camp since the uprising began Dec. 8. Soldiers initially barred even <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> relief officials from delivering food to the camp's 5,000 residents. But today, the army allowed three relief trucks carrying sardines, corned beef, beans, cooking oil, powdered milk and rice to enter the camp, according to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a spokesman for the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> has written letters to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy judge, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s trustee and supporters asking for a chance to save the troubled ministry, a newspaper reported. `` I believe it's time we have the chance to help save the ministry <PERSON> God </PERSON> gave us a vision to build,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said in the letter obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION>. `` Please let <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> and me, along with the partners who worked so hard to birth <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, fight for its right to continue.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> made the plea to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, trustee <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> supporters. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said the letter came in response to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s financial crisis and <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' decision Friday ordering the ministry at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, to begin planning its own liquidation. `` I once again ask for your forgiveness and for restoration,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> wrote. `` I beg those who have the future of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in their hands, before <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> is torn apart and sold, please let the founders have ninety days to try, under God, to save what I believe to be a God-given vision.'' The two-page letter also touches on the financial troubles that have plagued <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned in March 1987 after acknowledging a sexual encounter with <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and the payment of hush money to her. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his former top aides are under investigation by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> for possible mail, wire and tax fraud. The investigation is focusing on how <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> spent millions of dollars in contributions under <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s leadership, and whether <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his associates broke federal laws against raising money for one purpose and using it for another. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> claims <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> owes at least $ 55.7 million in back taxes and wants to revoke its tax exempt status. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> would have no comment because <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> is pursuing legal action against the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s attorney says the former evangelist plans to come to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> within the next six weeks to meet with state Assemblies of God officials and to seek forgiveness. The denomination defrocked <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> nearly a year ago. Lawyer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> called the move a `` peace-making mission,'' and said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> hopes to `` right whatever wrongs that can be righted.'' <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is not interested in reinstatement to the Assemblies of God. `` He's not asking for a job,'' <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> told the Observer. `` It's expressly designed not to request anything of them except forgiveness He wants to clear the air and say ` I'm sorry things went badly.'''

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> says a federal ranking of state education efforts is unfair and incomplete, and he wants the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to stop its annual `` wall chart'' comparing state-by-state improvements. The report `` fails to acknowledge the diminished role of the federal government in improving education, while holding individual states up to public criticism for failure to meet unspecified federal expectations,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said in a letter to Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` Premature reporting on education programs, improvements and achievements is discouraging to those who are implementing major reforms in public education. ... Such improvements can only be reached by long-term committment,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said in the letter, mailed Friday and distributed to reporters Monday. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has been using the wall chart for five years to show the educational performance of each state. In the latest chart, released in February, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> was 20th in combined Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, 48th in graduation rates, 44th in per-pupil expenditure, 40th in student-teacher ratios and 27th in average teacher salaries. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' letter, which was drafted by state education officials, complained that the Education Department's statistics are wrong. It repeated complaints about using SAT scores, saying the test is weighted more as a college admissions test in some states than others. It said the teacher salary comparisons do not take into account each state's cost of living, and it noted that some states include general equivalency diploma holders as high school graduates. <PERSON> Valena </PERSON> <PERSON> Plisko </PERSON>, director of elementary and secondary planning at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, defended the chart, saying it `` has been effective in prodding the states to improve their performance.''

 Band leader <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s career might not have been quite as successful had the founders of this <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city picked a different name 150 years ago. After all, `` Pardon me, boy, is that the <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION> choo choo?'' does n't really sing, does it? <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION> was one of several possibilities considered by land commissioners when they were naming the new town at <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>'s Landing in 1838, says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingood </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> historian. Other nominees were Lookout City, <ORGANIZATION> Albion </ORGANIZATION> and the eventual winner, the Cherokee Indian word for `` rock coming to a point,'' a reference to Lookout Mountain. `` There was spirited debate,'' <PERSON> Livingood </PERSON> said Sunday during a program marking <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>'s 150th birthday. The commissioners settled on <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Livingood </PERSON> said, because one observer noted that although the sound of the name was perhaps outlandish, the city's success would make the name `` pleasant and familiar, and, besides, there will be not another like it anywhere in the world.'' That prediction did n't exactly pan out _ there is a town in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> with the same name _ but <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION> has come a long way in the last century and a half, say those who have governed it in recent years.

 A 9-year-old girl whose frostbitten lower legs were amputated after she was abandoned in an unheated building walked out of a hospital today, and doctors said she had most of the abilities and all the energy of a cheerful youngster. <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>, who has been fitted with artificial limbs, limped very slightly but smiled and held two dolls when she walked down the front steps of La Rabida Children's Hospital. She was accompanied by her great-grandmother, <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>, her aunt, <PERSON> Sallie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>, and a cousin, <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlisle </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> will live with her great-grandmother in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, where she was found three months ago. `` She's in very good spirits,'' said <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shea </PERSON>, her physical therapist. `` She's very excited to be going home. She wo n't need physical therapy anymore. As you can see, she walked out fine.'' `` She's been doing wonderfully,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaudes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON>'s physician at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rabida </LOCATION>. `` She can ride a bicycle, she can roller skate. We took her to a ballgame over the weekend.'' <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said he had hoped to regain custody of his daughter but decided he had little chance of convincing the courts because he and his wife, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, already have two small children. <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> lived with her mother, <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, before being found Jan. 17 by a construction worker in the family's unheated home in a padlocked apartment building Authorities said the girl apparently had been locked inside the freezing attic several days earlier by her mother, who allegedly abandoned the girl. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, 25, has pleaded innocent to charges of felony child neglect. Doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Wyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Children </PERSON>'s Hospital determined they could not save <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON>'s lower legs from frostbite-caused gangrene, and amputated them 6 inches below the knees Jan. 23. The girl was transferred to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rabida </LOCATION>, also a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> hospital </ORGANIZATION>, on Jan. 29 to be fitted with artificial limbs and be trained how to use them. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabida </PERSON> staff members say they will miss <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> _ even though she had an urge once in a while to roller skate in the halls.

 `` She has her permanent legs now and puts them on and off by herself,'' <PERSON> Jaudes </PERSON> said. `` She also puts on and takes off her own socks. She'll have a counselor in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, but the physical problems are gone.'' The physician said <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> will be attending a regular elementary school in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, not a special school for the handicapped. `` You ca n't consider her handicapped,'' said <PERSON> Jaudes </PERSON>.

 Before she was abandoned, <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> had been a third-grader at <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daniel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where a fund has been set up for her. Because of the intense public interest and support <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> received after she was found, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabida </PERSON> authorities said they planned to bar reporters from interviewing her or her family. While she was being treated at <PERSON> Wyler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> received a bag of mail a day on average from well-wishers, hospital officials said. More importantly, the public contributed more than $ 120,000 to pay for <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON>'s medical treatment and future welfare. The bill at <PERSON> Wyler </PERSON> alone was $ 27,020. The bill at <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rabida </ORGANIZATION> was $ 18,000 in early March, and was then growing at the rate of about $ 600 a day.

 Tunisian Ambassador <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Yahia </PERSON> said today his country has evidence that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carried out last weekend's assassination of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Yahia </PERSON> said the most conclusive piece of evidence was the presence of a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 aircraft with Israeli markings off the Tunisian coast at the time of the assassination. The plane, carrying sophisticated electronic equipment, was used to jam telecommunications around the town where <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> lived, he said. The plane's registration number was 4X977, he said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s international aircraft designation code is `` 4X.'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Yahia </PERSON> said the government-appointed inquiry panel had found that the commandos used 9mm Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns to kill <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, one of the top leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, two bodyguards and a Tunisian gardner. Reports from <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> said the attack was carried out by seven people. He said the team used false Lebanese passports to enter <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, driving two <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> minibuses and a <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> car rented from a <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> car rental agency to reach <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>'s home. The cars were later found abandoned on a beach 10 miles from the scene of the attack, he said. The inquiry panel is still investigating whether the commandos got away by boat, he said. In all, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Yahia </PERSON> said, the preliminary investigation had determined the `` unequivocable responsibility of the Israeli government'' for Saturday's assassination of <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> by a commando team. Unconfirmed reports from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> say the operation was carried out by navy frogmen, commandos and the <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> intelligence agency. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has refused to confirm or deny allegations of its involvement.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS JACK WILLIAMS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five times the warning blared from the bridge on the USS Jack Williams: `` Silkworm incoming.'' Five times the Iranian missiles missed their target, a three ship attack group from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The U.S.-Iranian feud exploded into missile warfare Monday as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> attacked two Iranian platforms in retaliation for a mine that blew a hole in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate last week in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. During the day, the `` surface action group'' led by the <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, a guided-missile frigate, came under attack five times from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Silkworm anti-ship missile batteries. Although <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers on the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> identified the missiles as Silkworms, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, did not confirm they were the Chinese-made rockets. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said today it was still analyzing the attack. `` Silkworm incoming,'' blared the bridge, lurching the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> into violent maneuvers. Crewmen scrambled to spot the oncoming missiles. `` Everybody look astern! Everybody look astern!'' Lt. <PERSON> Augustino </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponturier </PERSON>, the officer of the deck, shouted to junior officers and lookouts. The gas turbine-drive frigate rolled sharply and pointed its stern toward the approaching missile, presenting its smallest target and allowing the aluminum-chaff launchers and other defensive weapons a clear shot. None of the first four Silkworms came close enough to be seen but members of a helicopter crew and a fire detail hit the deck as the fifth crossed behind the ship and slammed into a distant oil rig with an orange-yellow flash. Officers aboard the ship were elated with the response system. `` Not one of these ladies has a scratch on her, and the other guys ca n't say that,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>, operational commander of the force. In all, six Iranian ships were damaged by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fire Monday. <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> said a C-130 aircraft that was spotting targets for the Silkworm batteries was tracked by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets off the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Enterprise and was almost shot down. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials reported one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter with two crew members aboard missing Monday, and the search for it continued today. They denied Iranian claims that the vessel was shot down. The Williams, with members of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news media pool aboard, was the operational flagship for one of the three `` surface action groups'' taking part in the fighting Monday in the southern gulf. The others in the group were the destroyers <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. Monday's operations began when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships destroyed two Iranian-owned oil platforms. Over the next few hours, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces sank two missile-armed patrol boats, damaged two others and bombed and rocketed two frigates. One of the Iranian frigates, the <LOCATION> Sahand </LOCATION>, was hit by a Harpoon missile fired from the <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>. The white missile roared skyward in a cloud of smoke and streaked for the horizon, as the men on the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' bridge cheered wildly, `` Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!'' A flash and white smoke erupted on the horizon, followed by a long series of heavy explosions as the weapons and ammunition aboard the Sahand blew up. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION>, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilot who observed the Sahand reported it `` listing badly, with a big hole in its port side, the superstructure on fire and a lifeboat with some survivors in the water.'' Shortly after, F-14 jet fighters from the Enterprise attacked the Sahand's sister frigate, the <LOCATION> Sabalan </LOCATION>, after it fired a missile at the aircraft. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Willey </PERSON>, a Central Command officer accompanying the media pool, said the view from the bridge atop the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was `` both spectacular and frightening _ contrails from missiles could be seen in almost every direction.'' The oil platform attacks were aimed at what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials called military targets. Both the <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION> and Sirri platforms have been used by the Iranians for military purposes, they say. The strikes were ordered after the frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> hit a mine, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say was laid by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, in the central gulf last Thursday. Ten crewman were injured. While other task groups were attacking the platforms, the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' unit was sailing halfway through the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, in calm seas, under clear skies within range of the Iranian Silkworm batteries. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said the misssion of the three ships was to `` exercise the right of innocent transit passage and respond to all contingencies.'' And that's when the missile attacks came, apparently the first time <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had fired the Chinese-made rockets at ships in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> and the southern gulf. Later Monday, as the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and its accompanying warships sailed out of the `` Silkworm envelope'' into safer waters and a setting sun, the alert level was lowered from `` general quarters'' to the next lowest, `` condition one-alpha.'' Ponturier, of <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, took off his steel helmet and walked toward the door. `` It's <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> time,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today `` it seems to be quieting down'' in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> after a round of sea and air battles Monday in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dealt a heavy blow to Iranian forces. `` We hope it continues that way,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters during a photo-taking session at the start of a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> took a licking when it tried to strike back after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> destroyed two Iranian oil platforms. In the most intense exchanges since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> beefed up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firepower in the gulf last summer, American forces sank or damaged four Iranian attack boats and disabled two frigates that fired missiles at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes. Asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had underestimated what the Iranian response would be, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied: `` No.'' `` It seems to be quieting down. We hope it continues that way,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said nine ships were involved in a search-and-rescue mission for a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopter missing with two crewmen from Monday's operation. The attack helicopter, on a reconnaissance mission, had been due to land on the USS Wainwright by mid-afternoon Monday, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> time. Besides the ships, which searched through the night, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sent several aircraft aloft today as part of the search for the helicopter. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said that Iranian warships had brought down a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, had briefed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressional leadership on the situation in the gulf. Essentially, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> as saying, Iranian naval ships were in port today. Meanwhile, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said that while they support <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s action, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should reassess its go-it-alone policy of protecting the vital sea lanes. `` This is an action that was taken that was justified, and, I think, measured,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the committee's `` But I think we've got to make sure that we do n't convert this into a U.S.-Iranian war. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the committee's ranking Republican, said `` we'd like to see a more coordinated participation by our allies'' in the gulf. `` Our allies are there, but thus far they have declined efforts by our nation to suggest that we work at a more coordinated fashion.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> were interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. Both Democrats and Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> united Monday behind <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s warning that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will `` pay a price'' if it persists in trying to trade blows with a militarily superior force of American warships and aircraft in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said today that `` we need to re-examine our policy of protecting only 11 -LRB- Kuwaiti -RRB- ships. Many people do n't realize it, but if a British ship or a French ship is attacked by an Iraqi aircraft right in the sight of our own American ship, we do n't do anything. That has given the perception that we have lined up with the Iraqis.'' `` We've got to correct that perception and we've got to re-examine our policy,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. But the senator also said that `` we need to get our allies ... to protect certain zones.'' House Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' said `` I think we do n't want to unilaterally be there, the policemen over there Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said on the same program that `` we're not really protecting international shipping. What we're protecting is ships flying the American flag. Many of the criticisms that we had when this policy began is that we began it unilaterally without getting international cooperation.'' `` As time has gone on, the British, the French and the Italians have come to assume roles,'' he said. `` But, indeed, if there was a mistake in the policy originally, ... we did not act together and get cooperation when this began.'' The initial platform attack had been in retaliation for the mine explosion last week that damaged the USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and injured 10 crewmen. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there is `` conclusive evidence'' that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> planted the mine that exploded Friday. `` They must know that we will protect our ships, and if they threaten us, they'll pay a price,'' the president said in a speech to a business audience. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> won applause for consulting with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before sending the military into action. `` The mines have been clearly identified as manufactured by the Iranians and sown in the waters by the Iranians,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` The Iraniare carrying out terrorist acts <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s decision to fight back amounted to `` foolhardy behavior.'' `` I'm not sure that it's explainable in terms of Western logic at this point,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news conference. `` I have to only assume that it's some kind of a fanatical reaction or slavish obedience to a contingency plan. `` It certainly makes no sense whatsoever in military terms. And we hope that tomorrow that will bring peace in the region.'' From the White House to the Pentagon to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the message to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was the same: cool it, or else. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attacks on the oil platforms, which are used as staging areas for Iranian gunboats, were a `` measured response'' to the mining of the gulf. While saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants a more normal relationship with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` We've taken this action to make certain the Iranians have no illusions about the cost of irresponsible behavior. We aim to deter further Iranian aggression, not provoke.'' The incident was the second such outbreak of violence since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began escorting oil tankers through the gulf last July to protect them from attack from the warring parties in the 7 -LCB- - year Iran-Iraq war On Oct. 19, a raid was staged in retaliation to a missile attack on a Kuwaiti ship flying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag in which 18 Americans were injured. Two Iranian oil platforms were destroyed in what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the time termed a `` prudent'' response.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he eagerly awaits the fall presidential campaign against the Democrats `` even if they unleash <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also defended anew the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military strikes in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, saying they were designed to teach `` madmen'' like the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> a lesson. `` From having read the intelligence reports this morning, response around the world and in the countries in the area _ some whom wo n't publicly state it _ has been very strong and very understanding,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an audience here. `` We have a disproportionate responsibility to keep the sea lanes open and for the stability of the moderate states in the area,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He also told the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> breakfast that he was eager and ready to take on the Democrats in the fall. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s primary will be held next Tuesday. `` I ca n't wait for the debates with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee no matter who he turns out to be,'' the virtually certain <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee said. `` Even if they unleash <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> I ca n't wait.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor has cast a long shadow over the Democratic race, even though he has declined to run for the nomination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been citing the U a difficult language. It forces me to attempt linguistic acrobatics with my mouth that I'm not used too; I'm constantly in danger of getting stuck.'' For the interview, <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> made his remarks in nearly fluent but cautiously enunciated German. The play opened in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in January and has been sold out ever since. More than 40,000 people are expected to see the production before its scheduled April 30 closing, <PERSON> Gisela </PERSON> <PERSON> Huwe </PERSON>, a theater spokeswoman, said. `` ` <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s Tenth' is one of the greatest successes in the 40-year history of the <PERSON> Schiller </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Huwe </PERSON> said of the two-act play written by <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON>. Much of the play's action concentrates on efforts by a fictional <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> music critic named <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> to imagine how <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s 10th Symphony might have sounded It also focuses on his often stormy relations with his son, <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON>, who composes modern symphonies which Winter has no use for. A Viennese au-pair girl named <PERSON> Irmgard </PERSON>, who loves <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON>, manages to wake the composer from the dead. The composer rings the doorbell and strides, with long hair flowing, across the stage.

<TEXT>
 Arab hijackers of a Kuwaiti jet today brought a 20-year-old woman related to the emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to a microphone and she pleaded <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to meet the hijackers' demands as the ordeal entered its third week. `` If not, we are all in danger,'' said <PERSON> Anware </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>. Anware and her 22-year-old sister, <PERSON> Ibtesam </PERSON>, are the only two women left among the approximately 35 hostages, all thought to be Kuwaitis. It was the first time either of them has been made to plead for the hijackers' cause. In a tense but firm voice, <PERSON> Anware </PERSON> said, `` We want you to tell our families that my sister and I and all the passengers are well, although our morale is low.'' `` I hope from my family and government that they will hurry to free the prisoners. If not, we are all in danger. Thank you.'' It was the fifth time since the plane landed in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> early Wednesday that the hijackers have broadcast appeals from hostages for the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> government to release 17 men convicted on terrorist charges in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The pro-Iranian prisoners were responsible for the 1983 attacks on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> sheikdom. Another of the emir's cousin, <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, believed suffering from a nervous disorder, broadcast an almost incoherent but similar message Sunday. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has refused to meet the demand. There has been no apparent break in the stalemate although Algerian mediators continued their active shuttle between the plane and a high-level <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegation. This morning contact with the Moslem Shiite hijackers began with a request radioed to the control tower. `` Good morning,'' said one of the hijackers, speaking clearly in English. `` We'd like to have water for the plane, someone to clean the toilets and newspapers: five in Arabic and three in French. We also need one medicine, interviaform,'' a treatement for diarrhea. A yellow car carried an airport worker to the plane to fill the request. As the Moslem holy month of <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> began on Monday, the hijackers requested copies of the Koran, the Moslem holy book, which were delivered. During Ramadan, observant Moslems do not eat or drink during daylight hours. At the hijackers' request, a traditional pre-fast meal was delivered to the plane Sunday night for all aboard. The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> was hijacked April 5 with 112 people aboard and forced to land in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where 57 eventually were released. On April 8, the jet flew to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where two passengers were killed and 13 freed. Since landing in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> one passenger has been freed. The five to eight hijackers are armed with grenades and guns and have threatened to blow up the plane. A hostage freed on Thursday, 70-year-old <PERSON> Djumaa </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON>, flew out of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> on Monday night on a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> executive jet. Escorted to the plane by four members of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> negotiating delegation, <PERSON> Chatti </PERSON> waved to television cameras before getting on the plane but said nothing. The hijackers' only direct threat in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> was that made Saturday when they asked that the plane be refueled so they could `` settle our score'' with <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in another country, rather than in `` friendly <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>.'' Radio conversations on Monday made no reference to refueling the plane or leaving <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. Radio Algiers said in an Arabic language news broadcast on Monday that there was `` hope that a peaceful solution is still possible'' despite no indication that either side would make any concessions. The oficial radio reported `` new movement that gives a chance for new elements,'' but did not elaborate. Algerian officials have been acting as mediators between a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegation and the gunmen, boarding the plane several times a day for talks. Interior Minister <PERSON> Hedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khediri </PERSON>, in charge of the mediation effort, said early on he had obtained a promise from the hijackers that they would not resort to violence on Algerian soil.

 A tornado blasted through this <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> town before dawn today, destroying several homes and a college library, blowing off rooftops, flipping cars and leaving four people dead and 15 injured, officials said. The tornado touched down at 4:30 a.m. just west of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, about 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, and cut a 12-mile swath of destruction, authorities said. `` There was this huge roar and then I heard a tree crack out there and thought we were all gone,'' said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's dispatcher. The tornado passed only four blocks from her office. Four people were killed north of town, said Sheriff <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Peavy </PERSON>. Fifteen people were injured, but none of the injuries was critical, according to <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> Jeannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. A house-to-house search found no more bodies, but a man and a baby had to be freed from separate homes where they were trapped, <PERSON> Peavy </PERSON> said. Two of the deaths occurred in mobile homes blown apart by the tornado, and four other houses were seriously damaged as well, said <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` It did n't leave any of it. Not even a dish. You'd never know there was a trailer here,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, sister of one of the victims. Rescue units from adjoining counties were helping out, along with state law enforcement and forestry officials. State prisoners were also on their way to help with the cleanup, <PERSON> Peavy </PERSON> said. He had no estimate of the damage. The tornado was part of a storm system that struck across the Southeast with high winds, lightning and hail. Trees, roofs and mobile homes were damaged, and at least six other injuries were reported. <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, a town of about 3,500 people, is the county seat of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a thinly populated tobacco growing area of piney woods, rolling hills and swamps on the border with <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The twister's destructive path started in front of a shopping center and then proceeded straight into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junior </LOCATION> <LOCATION> College </LOCATION>, where it `` totaled the new library and took the roof off the auditorium,'' <PERSON> Peavy </PERSON> said. The twister blew away several homes, blew the roof off a nearby church, overturned cars and knocked down trees, <PERSON> Peavy </PERSON> said. As far as his office knew, all the damage was from one tornado, <PERSON> Peavy </PERSON> said. He said the tornado's sweep through town lasted under 30 minutes. Electric company workers were restoring power throughout the area. Two tornadoes struck near the towns of <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bascom </PERSON>, about 100 miles to the west of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> emergency management director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mader </PERSON>. Three homes and a trailer were destroyed and five homes seriously damaged, he said, and two people were slightly injured. Many county roads were blocked by fallen trees, he said, and officials were surveying the area by helicopter. The tornadoes were spawned by a belt of thunderstorms being pushed by a cold front. Hail the size of golf balls and damaging winds hit <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. More than one inch of rain fell in one hour this morning in <LOCATION> Waycross </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, 70 miles northeast of here, and wind gusts of 40 mph were reported in <LOCATION> Valdosta </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, trees and power lines were reported blown down, a barn was reported destroyed and a tin roof was blown off an old building. The winds destroyed up to nine mobile homes west of <LOCATION> Bainbridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, Monday night, injuring three people, one seriously. The sheriff's office said the wind left the homes in shreds. <LOCATION> Bainbridge </LOCATION> is 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>. A 9-year-old girl from <LOCATION> Cottonwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, was injured by lightning as she stood near a stove at her home Monday night. The lightning accompanied a tornado that moved through southern <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> about 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Tallahasse </LOCATION>. In the eastern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bulloch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, six mobile homes and one house were heavily damaged shortly after dawn today, but no injuries were reported, the weather service said. Tornado watches were still in effect across 14 southeastern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and 15 northeastern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> counties until at least five hours after the tornado hit. <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has been hit by seven tornadoes since 1959 with only one injury reported, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

 A giant <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-5B aircraft has delivered 45 tons of detection gear to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s nuclear test site in an unprecendented flight, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The gear is designed to help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> determine the size of a future Soviet nuclear test, scheduled to take place sometime this summer. The gear left <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> Friday afternoon aboard the giant aircraft and arrived at an airfield on the Soviet site Sunday evening, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> time, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said Monday. A dozen test site scientists and workers were also on board and joined 10 other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel who had gone to the Soviet site at <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> earlier this month. Seven Soviet scientists are currently at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site, preparing to monitor an American blast sometime this summer. `` They've been to ground zero a couple of times and are planning where they'll put their equipment,'' <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. The exchange is designed to test monitoring equipment the two sides would use in making sure each country is adhering to nuclear test treaties. The testing of monitoring equipment is a prelude to a possible nuclear test ban. The seven Soviet scientists are staying at a dormitory at Mercury, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, a government town at the test site 65 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. The Soviets spent some time sightseeing Saturday, just as other Soviet nuclear scientists did during a historic visit in January. They toured downtown's Glitter Gulch and the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, posing in front of a display of $ 1 million in cash at <LOCATION> Binion </LOCATION>'s Horseshoe Hotel and Casino <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquilina </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, told workers in a letter last week that the Soviets would be on the site for several weeks. He encouraged test site workers to `` try to be good hosts and treat them like other visitors to the test site.''

<HEAD>Consumer Reports: Nursing Home Insurance Not a Good Buy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Insurance to cover the costs of nursing home care has been promoted increasingly in the last few years, but probably is n't a good buy for most Americans, a national consumer group said Tuesday. And anyone considering such coverage should study the policy carefully, Consumers Union warned. Even insurance sales representatives are confused about what coverage is being offered, officials of the group said at a news conference. Consumers Union rates more than 50 long-term care policies in the May edition of its magazine, Consumer Reports, and finds some fault with every one of them. `` The private insurance system can not spread its costs over a large enough number of people to make coverage affordable to the millions who need it,'' Consumers Union President <PERSON> Rhoda </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpatkin </PERSON> said. Only the federal government can do that, she said, calling for congressional action to provide long-term care protection. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> of the consumers group said policies providing long-term care are quite expensive and are not recommended for people of moderate income. Prices can range as high as $ 100 a month to $ 260 a month. And people under 60 should n't buy such policies unless there is some guarantee that benefits will rise to keep pace with inflation, Ms. <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> added. Nonetheless, many policies are being offered and some people may be tempted to buy them, she said. Problems to watch out for include: _ Protection may not be available to people who need it most _ those with health problems already Check policies for exclusions that disallow coverage for pre-existing conditions. _ Some policies were found to cover only certain types of care, but not custodial care, potentially the longest and most costly type _ More than half of all nursing home patients are admitted without having been hospitalized first, but a majority of the long-term care policies checked required prior hospitalization before benefits could be provided _ Alzheimer's disease accounts for half of all nursing home patients, yet a majority of the policies did not specifically state that it was covered A company flooded with claims could decide to use the vague language of its policies to exclude Alzheimer's coverage, Consumers Union warned. In addition, the group noted that some policies require a confirmed diagnosis to provide coverage, and Alzheimer's can not always be confirmed except by autopsy.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> faces new problems rebuilding a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> rocked by resignations now that his second choice for the No. 2 post has told him to find somebody else. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is looking for a new nominee after former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> told the attorney general's aides on Monday to begin searching for a new candidate, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources say <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, asked today whether <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> had withdrawn, said, `` Not yet. I expect we will be hearing today or tomorrow.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> declined comment when asked whether he was thinking of other names to suggest. The attorney general was questioned as he left a memorial service for law enforcement officers slain while enforcing drug laws. While department sources said <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> had not flatly withdrawn, they said he already had informed the department that he probably would do so. The sources, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> asked that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s aides begin looking for other candidates. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s problems in filling the post of deputy attorney general, as well as the position of assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division, stem from the abrupt resignations March 30 of <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burns </ORGANIZATION> and criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. They quit out of concern that the nearly year-old criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is hurting <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> operations, morale and image. A number of current and former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys have been approached about taking <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>'s post, but all have turned it down, department sources have said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who testified before a federal grand jury for four hours in the probe Monday, has refused to resign, predicting that he wo n't be indicted. In an attempt to recover quickly from the resignations, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> hurriedly announced the selection of Shepherd for the No. 2 position two weeks ago without customary White House clearance and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background checks. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> still has not nominated Shepherd. <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, 62, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> attorney, told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> last Friday that he was giving serious consideration to withdrawing because of stress on his family stemming from his selection. A former bookkeeper from <ORGANIZATION> Shepherd </ORGANIZATION>'s law firm testified shortly before <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> recommended him for the post that she had an affair with <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>. The bookkeeper, who was convicted of embezzlement, claimed <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> had told her to write checks to herself. <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> denied that he had an affair with her or that he had authorized her to write checs. The trial testimony and <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>'s membership in an all-white country club and an all-male social club brought increasing public scrutiny of <ORGANIZATION> Shepherd </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> announced his selection April 5. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s first choice to fill the post of deputy attorney general was former federal judge <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> lawyer. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he was unable to take the post because he had a heavy caseload and had gone to work at the law firm just last year. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal problems were not a major factor in his decision not to take the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> position. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has gone outside the department in his attempt to fill <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>'s old job at the head of the criminal division, other <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources said. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saltzburg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> law professor, has been sounded out about possibility of taking the job, said the sources speaking on condition of anonymity. Reached at his home, <PERSON> Saltzburg </PERSON> said he had n't been offered the job, but would not comment when asked whether he had been approached about it. <PERSON> Saltzburg </PERSON> also is a consultant on a legal question in the Iran-Contra prosecutions being conducted by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Saltzburg </PERSON> is a consultant to former federal judge and ex-U.S. attorney <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> was hired by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to represent the Iran-Contra prosecutor on the issue of congressional immunity. The legal question is whether or not the congressional testimony compelled by grants of immunity to former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffer <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and businessman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> prejudice their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

 The body of slain <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> commander <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> was flown to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> today for burial in the Syrian capital in the absence of his lifetime comrade, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. The 52-year-old al-Wazir, better known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, was assassinated Saturday in a commando raid at his home outside the Tunisian capital. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources have acknowledged that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was responsible for <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>'s death but the government officials have not confirmed this. The plane carrying <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON>'s body arrived in the Syrian capital at 2:45 p.m. after a flight from <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. Accompanying the body were <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Intisar </PERSON>, his five children, and senior <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> officials, including political department chief <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON>, Executive Committee member <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, and the guerrilla movement's security chief, <PERSON> Hayel </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief, saw the body off at <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> airport but stayed behind, apparently because of his feud with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> were expelled from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> in June 1983 after a Syrian-backed mutiny in <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> ranks. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief's media adviser, <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, confirmed in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would not attend <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>'s funeral Wednesday. <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Ramle </LOCATION>, which is now in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and had asked to be buried close to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. His mother and father live in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said another top <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, better known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON>, also would not attend the funeral. He, too, has not visited <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> since the PLO-Syrian feud. <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> launched <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s main guerrilla group, in 1965. Fatah accounts for more than 80 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s military strength. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the Tunisian government have blamed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the murder of <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, who reportedly masterminded <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> rioting against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have privately acknowledged that the Mossad intelligence service and the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> navy cooperated in the assassination. The Tunisian government filed a complaint today with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Tunisian investigators said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was behind the attack, in which al-Wazir and two aides were killed. <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> today requested an urgent meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to condemn the assassination. President <PERSON> Zine </PERSON> <PERSON> el </PERSON> <PERSON> Abidine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> condemned the `` flagrant, premeditated aggression against Tunisian sovereignty.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government on Monday sharply criticized <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>'s killing `` Violence is not the solution to the problems of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. The Tunisian investigators' report said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 was 34 miles outside <LOCATION> Tunisian </LOCATION> air space at time of the attack. The plane, `` of the type used in the electronic war,'' jammed communications in <PERSON> Sidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bou </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON>, the northern suburb where <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> lived outside <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, the report said. `` The terrorist group which assassinated the Palestinian leader had sophisticated technological support which put this operation beyond the framework of normal terrorists and into the kind of terrorism that only states are in a position to practice,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Tuesday called for religious freedom for Ukrainian Catholics in a letter marking the 1,000 anniversary of Christianity in what is now the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` No one ought to consider membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> as incompatible with the good of the homeland and with the heritage of Saint <PERSON> Vladmir </PERSON>,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in a letter to Ukrainian Catholics around the world. Prince <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> introduced Christianity in Kievan Rus', the ancient name of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, with a mass baptism on the banks of the <LOCATION> Dnieper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in 988. The Ukrainian church was suppressed in 1946 by Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who ordered it absorbed into the Russian Orthodox church. Ukrainian priests who refused to accept the state-dominated Orthodox church were shot or imprisoned, according to church historians. Today, Eastern Rite Ukrainian Catholics make up the largest underground church in the officially atheist <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Ukrainian clerics say there are up to 4 million Ukrainian Catholics in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including 10 secret bishops and more than 100 priests.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> negotiators asked the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> today to support the automaker's efforts to organize plant workers into teams and help avoid increased assembly costs. The team plan would allow <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> greater flexibility in using different workers for different jobs, Vice President <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said after a second morning of meetings with the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> on a new contract. St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's No. 3 automaker, wants modifications to a pattern contract adopted last year at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to help avoid cost increases. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> wants to set a minimum retirement age to keep more workers active in their prime and increase the ratio of active workers to retirees. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers now retire as early as age 48. Adopting a minimum retirement age, as well as encouraging workers to join prepaid health care plans, would help keep <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s per-car production cost from going as much as $ 3.50 above <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> said the union had no immediate comment on <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s proposals. On Monday, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s senior executives will forgo bonuses in years when the No. 3 automaker earns too little to share profits with workers. The announcement came as the sides opened early talks on a contract covering 66,000 workers in 15 states. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers have no profit-sharing formula under the current contract, which expires Sept. 14. But union and company officials agree they will adopt an industry-pattern agreement established last fall at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that contains profit-sharing. Union officials will study St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s announcement before commenting, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Laarman </PERSON> said, calling it `` a free gift, the kind you have to look at real close.'' <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> leaders have blasted <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest automaker, for paying millions of dollars in cash bonuses or stock awards to executives in the past two years while saying its earnings were insufficient to distribute profits to workers `` There is a public perception that it is unfair _ and we tend to agree with that,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. `` In any year where profit-sharing payments are not made to <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> employees, the annual senior executive bonuses will also not be paid. We intend to work through that issue in a commitment form with the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said they hope to reach a contract settlement in two to three weeks. Union bargainers presented their demands Monday. Company negotiators were scheduled to present proposals today before the release of a company proxy statement likely to show that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> again exercised stock options granted in the early 1980s, when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s stock was worth a fraction of its present value. In 1986, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> earned more than $ 20 million in salary, benefits and exercised stock options. The pattern contract's profit-sharing formula resulted in a record $ 636 million distributed among 156,000 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> workers last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> profit-sharing checks averaged about $ 4,000 per worker. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said pattern bargaining `` has always served our membership very well. It has been a stabilizing force within the companies and between them.'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> wants to set up a committee of union and company officials and outside participants to track the new contract's ability to protect jobs and increase efficiency and quality at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> plants. The committee's findings would be used in drawing up a new contract in 1990, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said, apparently indicating <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will agree to the union's demand for a two-year contract. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said they want to put <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s contract expiration back in synch with the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> pacts so that in 1990, all three will expire together for the first time in a decade. The talks, which normally would begin in mid-July, cover wages, benefits and working conditions. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> contract covers 51,600 hourly, 5,600 salaried and 6,000 laid-off workers at factories, parts depots and offices in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led the balloting in the first round of the Capitol Hill `` primary'' today, when <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> named 43 members as `` super delegates'' to this summer's convention. The presidential candidates focused their attention on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, where 255 delegates were at stake, but nearly as many convention seats were to be decided by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats in sessions today and Wednesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the backing of 13 of those selected, while most of the professional politicians _ 21 _ remained uncommitted. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, whose campaign was dependent on a good showing in today's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, was second to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, gaining the support of six of his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleagues. He was named as a delegate as well. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, whose campaign is on hold, managed to win only a seat for himself and the backing of fellow Illinois Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' closest challenger, was shut out. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s choices kept <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' overall delegate lead intact. According to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> count, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 881 delegates to 745 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 419 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 183. Uncommitted delegates totaled 622. Today's choices came in a quick public vote by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, following weeks of secret jockeying for the spots at the convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said that the selection process was relatively painless. `` We were pleased that we were able to accommodate almost every Democratic member who requested to be an unpledged delegate,'' the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Democrat said. He did not name the two who lost out because of seniority. The House Democratic Caucus makes its official choices for 210 `` super delegate'' slots on Wednesday, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is ahead among those already nominated for those positions as well. The results from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> caucus were not a surprise, although 32 of the 43 were nominated last week in secret. The other 11 were nominated and put on the list over the weekend. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> obtained a list of those nominees. Among the first 32, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had nine, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> five, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> two and 16 were uncommitted. The 11 additional delegates named today added four delegate votes for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, two for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and six to uncommitted. A total of 646 of the 4,162 votes to be cast at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention will come from super delegates. In addition to the 253 congressional slots, 362 votes will be cast by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and 26 by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governors. Five former party leaders also have automatic seats at the convention. The 11 senators added to the delegate list today were: <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines, Texas Air Corp. Lash Out at Unions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The executives of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, lashed out at the unions today for a `` slanderous safety campaign'' and `` misinformation'' that they say has led to the government investigation into the airline company. `` Eastern today is the most watched airline in the business,'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> told a news conference, adding that he welcomed the government probes into <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, also part of his airline empire. `` The ramp inspections -LRB- ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- will demonstrate once and for all that <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern are as safe as any major airline,'' said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. `` What is at issue is how far a union is permitted to go by weakening a company through harassament.. -LRB- and -RRB- misinformation ... in part -LRB- in an attempt -RRB- to take over the company,'' said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who vowed to keep Eastern `` The company is not for sale,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said, adding that while he is aware of interests by some union leaders to launch a hostile takeover he has no concerete evidence of such a move. Officials from the unions representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s mechanics and pilots could not be reached immediately for comment on the charges. They have said in the past that they are only trying to highlight efforts by <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to weaken Eastern. The airline and the mechanics' union are negotiating a contract in which the union has been resisting demands by management that it take significant wage concessions. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, said that he is confident the federal investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> will conclude the airline is being operated safely. He said federal inspectors have examined all of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s jets at least once since the probe was announced last week and some planes have been examined five or six times as they operate in and out of different airports. Bakes accused the unions of a `` slanderous safety campaign'' which he said has been a `` major factor'' in recent financial losses by the airline. While some Eastern jets have been taken out of service after the inspections, he characterized such actions as routine and `` proof that the system is working.'' `` Everyday planes are being taken out of service'' briefly as part of the airline's normal operations when they have mechanical or other problems. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest airline company, has been reeling from a series of inspections announced last week by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> into safety at the two airlines and the parent holding company's management and finances. The news conference also was attended by two members of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors and by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Borman </PERSON>, who was Eastern's chairman before the airline was sold to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and now remains on <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors All of the executives blamed the labor turmoil at Eastern for creating `` an atmosphere'' which prompted the unusual scrutiny of both the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and its parent <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Bakes said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is `` clearly being hurt by operating in an atmosphere of many myths'' but that the various federal investigations of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> so far have had only a small impact on flight bookings at the airline. `` Obviously this is n't helping our business,'' he said. Eastern, meanwhile, said it was launching an advertising campaign aimed at countering the attack on its image. The aim of the ads as well as Tuesday's news conference is `` to clear the air'' and `` set the record straight,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Onstad </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> vice president.

 Nine-year-old <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>, whose frostbitten legs were amputated after she was abandoned in an unheated apartment this winter, walked out of a hospital Tuesday on artificial legs, smiling and waving. `` She's very motivated, very courageous,'' said <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shea </PERSON>, the girl's physical therapist at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rabida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION>'s Hospital. `` She runs and she jumps and she can skip. She can do just about everything. `` The only thing she ca n't do is double-Dutch jump rope because I do n't know how,'' and so she could n't teach her. <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON>'s ordeal touched hearts nationwide after she was found locked in a Gary, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, apartment Jan. 17 by a construction worker who said he heard a child's voice plead, `` Please do n't board me up.'' Hundreds of presents, thousands of letters and donations totaling $ 125,000 poured in to cheer her up and pay her hospital bills after her legs were amputated just below the knee. Before <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> left the hospital Tuesday, her relatives packed up four boxes with toys and other presents she received. Under a sunny blue sky, <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> walked down the front steps of La Rabida, holding two dolls and wearing a pink and white lace dress with pink bows in her hair. She limped very slightly as she walked to a waiting car, accompanied by her great-grandmother, <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>, her aunt, <PERSON> Sallie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>, and a cousin, <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlisle </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> will live with her great-grandmother in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. One of <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON>'s nurses kissed her while Ms. <PERSON> O'Shea </PERSON> made sure her seat belt was fastened. `` She's in very good spirits,'' Ms. <PERSON> O'Shea </PERSON> told reporters. `` She's very excited to be going home. She wo n't need physical therapy anymore. As you can see, she walked out fine.'' While at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rabida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> learned to ride a bicycle _ falling only once _ and how to roller skate without using canes, Ms. <PERSON> O'Shea </PERSON> said. `` She's been doing wonderfully,'' said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaudes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON>'s physician at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rabida </LOCATION> `` You ca n't consider her handicapped.'' <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> lived with her mother, <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, before being found by construction worker <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> who had been sent to board up an unheated brick home after a mortgage foreclosure. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said at the time that he heard a child pleading for help, removed a six-foot refrigerator from the top of the stairway and kicked open a padlocked door to rescue the girl. Doctors said later the severity of her injuries indicated she had been in the extreme cold for at least five days. Doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Wyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Children </PERSON>'s Hospital determined they could not save <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON>'s lower legs from gangrene, and amputated them Jan. 23. Her 25-year-old mother has pleaded innocent to three counts of felony child neglect and remains in the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Crown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, in lieu of $ 50,000 bail, said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the county prosecutor's office. Her trial is scheduled June 20. She faces up to 60 years in prison, if convicted on all three counts, Ms. <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said. The girl was transferred to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rabida </LOCATION>, also a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> hospital </ORGANIZATION>, on Jan. 29 to be fitted with artificial limbs. Her bill at <PERSON> Wyler </PERSON> reached $ 27,020 and at <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rabida </ORGANIZATION> it was averaging about $ 500 a day, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabida </PERSON>'s development director, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Monjar </PERSON>, said, which would have brought it to about $ 39,500 through Monday. Donated money not used for medical bills will be used to provide for <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON>'s future education and care. In <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> will return soon to a regular elementary school, probably as a fourth-grader, Ms. <PERSON> Monjar </PERSON> said.

 Unreasonable fear of AIDS could cause a substantial disruption of the workplace unless employees are educated about how to deal with co-workers who have the fatal disease, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The survey, conducted by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herold </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, showed that of 2,000 employees questioned across the country, 42 percent said they would not work with anyone who has AIDS. Twenty-nine percent said they felt so strongly about it that they would quit their jobs before working with an AIDS patient. <PERSON> Herold </PERSON> said at a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> national headquarters that there already have been incidents in which work came to a standstill as a result of unreasonable fear toward the immune deficiency disease. He said a state government office in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was shut down completely when a worker with AIDS became ill and vomited in his office. Maintenance workers refused to clean up the mess and co-workers refused to continue to work in the area. The office was forced to close for the day, he said. A power company was forced to cancel a cardiopulminary resuscitation training program when workers said that they would not use the skill if they learned it because of their fear of AIDS, he said. CPR requires mouth-to-mouth breathing. `` They -LRB- the workers -RRB- said that if anybody touched a live wire and got electrocuted, they would just have to die because nobody would do CPR,'' said <PERSON> Herold </PERSON>. He declined to identify the state government office or the utility company. <PERSON> Herold </PERSON> said that companies need to make policies now dealing with AIDS-infected employees because it often is too late to make policies after the problem develops. `` The passions run high when AIDS if found in the workplace,'' said <PERSON> Herold </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> announced that it has developed a program to help head off such problems through an AIDS education course offered to businesses for their employees. Called `` Working Beyond Fear,'' the course includes a video presentation and an instructor who can answer questions and promote discussion in meetings of employees, said <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON>, manager of the AIDS program at the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> national headquarters. Ms. <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> said that more than a quarter million people are expected to be infected by the AIDS virus in the 1990s, suggesting that AIDS in the workplace will become a growing issue. `` It is conceivable that every business in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will be affected by AIDS,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON>.

AIDS is a contagious disease that destroys the immune system, rendering the body incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. It is caused by a virus that most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. The disease currently is incurable and fatal. Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users, although a small percentage of cases are attributed to transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring. As of April 4, AIDS had been diagnosed in 58,270 Americans, of whom more than half, or 32,545, have died since 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Court Upholds States' Power to Control Gasoline Prices, Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday upheld the power of states to control gasoline prices and oil industry profits in a ruling that state officials say will help protect the public when there are energy crises. The justices voted, 8-0, to reinstate regulations in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> that limit oil company profits and prevent an excise tax from being passed on to consumers. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, writing for the court, said the absence of specific federal legislation on gasoline regulation leaves the states free to adopt such rules. The ruling treats <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, a commonwealth, as though it were a state and applies to all states. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> rejected oil industry arguments that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, by eliminating gasoline controls, mandated a free market in petroleum products. There may be a `` general congressional desire'' favoring the free market, he said. `` But unenacted approval, beliefs and desires are not laws,'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> added. `` Without a text that can ... plausibly be interpreted as prescribing federal pre-emption -LRB- of state power -RRB- it is impossible to find that a free market was mandated by federal law.'' The ruling was hailed by <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Genzer </PERSON>, general counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Officials. `` The governors need the ability to respond quickly'' when there are energy shortages, he said. `` I've heard it a million times. When they're standing in gas lines or do n't have enough home fuel, people come to the governor or the state energy director,'' not to the federal government for help, he added. <PERSON> Genzer </PERSON> said the ruling may not have great immediate impact because there are no oil shortages now that require emergency state action. But he said that without Tuesday's decision states could be powerless, for example, to enforce so-called set-aside programs requiring that a percentage of gasoline be reserved for top-priority needs when there are shortages. Most states have laws that give governors broad emergency powers to protect fuel supplies. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling overturns a 1986 decision by a federal appeals court here that said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended to bar state regulation of the oil industry when it lifted controls on gasoline effective in 1981. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized the federal government in 1970 to place controls on petroleum products in an effort to curb inflation. That law expired in 1973. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in the wake of an Arab oil embargo, then enacted an emergency law placing extensive price and allocation controls on gasoline. That was followed in 1975 by a new law aimed at promoting oil conservation. The 1975 law was amended later to provide for gradual deregulation and give the president sweeping authority to lift controls selectively. Complete deregulation by the federal government was required as of Sept. 30, 1981. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, which previously had suspended its regulation of petroleum products while the federal controls were in effect, placed an excise tax on oil refiners in 1986. The Puerto Rico Department of Consumer Affairs then issued regulations requiring advance notice of price increases, prohibiting wholesalers from passing on the cost of the excise tax to retailers and imposing maximum profit margins on sales by wholesalers to retailers. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s regulations, challenged in a lawsuit by oil companies, were supported by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and state and local officials. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counties </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Conference of Mayors were among the groups that urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to rule in favor of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> did not take part in Tuesday's ruling In other action, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>: _ Ruled, 5-3, that the government's planned development of part of the Six Rivers National Forest in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> does not violate Indians' religious rights The decision revived the federal government's plans to harvest timber and improve a road in an area considered sacred by three tribes. _ Made it easier, by an 8-1 vote in an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> case, for creditors to recover debts owed by a dead person by requiring generally that they be notified directly when the debtor's will is reviewed in court _ Ruled against a group of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> welfare recipients who said they were given inadequate notice about a change in their eligibility for federal benefits The 5-3 ruling said states are not required to provide advance written notice about the effects of 1981 changes in eligibility requirements of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program.

 A court convicted <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> on Tuesday of abducting two West Germans as ransom for his brother, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, who is accused of hijacking a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, 29, was sentenced to 13 years in prison after being found guilty on all charges of kidnapping, coercion and possession of explosives. `` It is totally reprehensible to rob two innocent people of their freedom and make them fear for their lives,'' Chief Judge <PERSON> Arend </PERSON> said in explaining the sentence he and his four colleagues meted out to <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. The 13-year term was 18 months longer than the prosecution requested. The maximum allowed was 15 years. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who is bearded and wore a sport coat and open-necked shirt, slumped into his chair after hearing the verdict and remained silent. More than 100 spectators, most of them reporters, were in the room. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport Jan. 13, 1987, and <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> 13 days later, both with explosives in their possession. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is accused in the June 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in which a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. Both Hamadis were living in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at the time of their arrests. After <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was jailed, but while his brother was free, two West Germans were kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> on Jan. 17 and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> on Jan. 20. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> was released in September, but <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> remains a hostage. <PERSON> Arend </PERSON> said the evidence proved <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was among radical Shiite Moslems who plotted the kidnappings to try to block <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has refused extradition and assigned <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s case to juvenile court for trial. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, deputy <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said: `` We commend today's action by the West German court, which sends a clear signal to terrorists.'' Defense lawyer <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON> <PERSON> Hild </PERSON> said he would appeal and told reporters: `` I do not find this judgment at all convincing.'' <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> denied involvement in the kidnappings but admitted storing explosives near his home in <LOCATION> Saarland </LOCATION> state for his younger brother. The chief judge said in court: `` After the arrest of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, the group in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> considered whether to attack the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, hijack a German airliner or kidnap a German citizen,'' and decided on kidnapping. An older <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> brother, <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON>, also was among the plotters, <PERSON> Arend </PERSON> said. He is security chief in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Party of God -RRB-, a Shiite Moslem group allied with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In the 3 -LCB- - month trial of <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, the court heard tapped telephone conversations between him and <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> friends in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> indicating he was among the plotters A compelling piece of evidence was a letter <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> sent to his mother from captivity that bore <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s fingerprints. `` There is no doubt the fingerprints are those of <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Arend </PERSON> said. He said evidence showed the defendant acted as an interpreter during questioning of the hostaged soon after their abductions. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has spent several years in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and is fluent in the language, but was in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> were kidnapped. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> threatened <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> at one point while holding a gun and also struck him with his hand, <PERSON> Arend </PERSON> said. `` The accused demanded that <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> hand over the addresses of other Germans in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' which indicating the kidnappers were seeking more victims, the judge declared. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> testified at the trial that he and <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> were chained to a wall for four months. `` Animals should not be treated the way the hostages have been treated,'' <PERSON> Arend </PERSON> said, looking directly at <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. He said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> planned to take the explosives stored near <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s home to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for terrorist acts. The judge did not elaborate. According to <PERSON> Arend </PERSON>, evidence showed <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> also was guilty of coercion. That charge stemmed from the kidnappers' threat to kill their hostages if <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was given to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> rejected the extradition request last year and said he would be tried here. No trial date has been set for <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, whose case was turned over to juvenile court. Prosecutors' files show he now is 23, but judicial officials say there is some question about his age at the time the hijacking was planned.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Twelve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> students have been dropped from the student campus patrol and two of them face criminal charges of stealing from the offices they were assigned to protect. Not all 12 were involved in crimes, but some knew and did not inform supervisors, said university Police Chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dollins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dollins </PERSON> said he wo n't abolish the 4-year-old program, in which about 60 students are paid $ 3.50 an hour to patrol the campus. `` When we first started, the students were motivated out of a desire to provide public safety on campus,'' said <PERSON> Dollins </PERSON>. `` We need to get students with qualities of courage and integrity on board.'' One of the 12 student patrol members, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boch </PERSON>, gave police his diary detailing some of the incidents. `` I discover that <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> building is easy-open city with my trusty ... pocketknife,'' <PERSON> Boch </PERSON> wrote in the diary. `` God, this job is just practice breaking and entering.'' <PERSON> Boch </PERSON> and the other 11 face possible university disciplinary action. <PERSON> Boch </PERSON> said `` it was sort of a game'' to get into offices, where he allegedly took small items such as stationery and pens. However, <PERSON> Boch </PERSON> said that when he discovered another patrol member was stealing more valuable items, he told the student patrol coordinator and handed over his diary. <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Difanis </PERSON> later charged two patrol members, one with burglary, felony theft and misdemeanor theft and the other with misdemeanor theft. <PERSON> Boch </PERSON> will not face criminal charges, said <PERSON> Difanis </PERSON>. `` It's silly little things,'' <PERSON> Boch </PERSON>'s diary said. `` You can call it burglary and theft if you want, but we did n't see it as crime per se.'' He added: `` I see in hindsight I should n't have kept a diary.''

<HEAD>Single-Family Housing Starts Up Sharply for Second Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction of single-family homes rose sharply in March for the second consecutive month, the government said Tuesday, offering evidence of a healthy building season this spring. However, a steep decline in apartment construction held the overall level of housing starts to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.54 million units in March, a modest 1.9 percent increase over the previous month, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obrinsky </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, said the March increase, coupled with an overall 9.6 percent jump in February, provide evidence that housing has recovered from its slump in December and January. Housing starts plummeted 15.8 percent in December, the sharpest monthly decline in more than three years, and drifted another 1.2 percent lower in January. Analysts attributed the decline to builders' fear that the October stock market crash would dampen home buying and to the pre-crash buildup in mortgage interest rates. `` Whatever problems there might have been in the worst of the winter months, housing seems to have recovered pretty much,'' <PERSON> Obrinsky </PERSON> said. `` It's not going to be a boom year for housing, but the decline from last year should be pretty moderate.'' Housing construction hit an eight-year high of 1.81 million units in 1986 and fell 10 percent in 1987. Analysts are projecting another 4 percent to 8 percent decline this year. <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said lower interest rates, strong employment gains and the rebound in consumer confidence after the crash `` are the ingredients we need for a good spring buying season.'' However, he warned, `` we have to anticipate that rising mortgage interest rates will lead to a tailing off in the second half of the year.'' Rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which shot up above 11.5 percent before the stock market crash, dipped below 10 percent in February and March before rising to 10.19 percent last week. Economists are projecting rates of about 11 percent by the end of the year. Housing permits, considered a good sign of future economic activity, also rose in March, moving up 2.1 percent to an annual rate of 1.45 million units. The strength in starts last month came in construction of single-family housing, which rose 7.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million units after an even stronger 8.9 percent climb in February. Construction of multi-family units fell 12.3 percent to an annual rate of 358,000 units. The construction of buildings with five or more units was at its lowest rate since June 1982, during the last recession. Apartment construction has been in a slump because the new tax law passed in 1986 removed many of the tax shelter benefits of investing in real estate. Also, the old law had encouraged overbuilding in some areas. `` Multi-family housing starts are in a range that we are going to have to get used to for most of this year and perhaps much of next year, until vacancy rates come down,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> A. Regalia, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. Regionally, the West posted the strongest gain in March, 18.7 percent. Starts also rose in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, by 2.7 percent. Housing starts fell 5.8 percent in the South and 3.5 percent in the Northeast.

<HEAD>Thiokol, NASA Enter Final Test Phase Before Shuttle Flights Resume</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The third full-scale firing of a redesigned solid fuel booster rocket for the space shuttle was scheduled for Wednesday with deliberate flaws built in to test safety features. The two-minute firing of the 126-foot-long, 1.2 million-pound booster was scheduled for 3 p.m. EDT at <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s Wasatch Operations plant 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` This is a really important milestone in the resumption of flight,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>. `` In a sense, it's the culmination of the redesign effort of two years. If all three of the -LRB- final -RRB- tests proceed satisfactorily, the launch preparations proceed.'' The horizontal test is designed to reveal any weaknesses in booster, which was redesigned after the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the shuttle Challenger. The disaster, which killed Challenger's seven-member crew, was blamed on a flawed booster rocket seal that allowed blazing exhaust to escape through a joint in the side and ignite the shuttle's external liquid fuel tank Wednesday's test is the first in the last series of firings planned by <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> before the shuttle's first post-Challenger launch, scheduled for mid-August. Other full-scale tests are scheduled for June and July. The rocket for Wednesday's test was assembled with deliberate flaws in sealing material in the joints between segments of the booster. Flawed seals have been tested previously in short-duration tests, but never in a full-scale firing, <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. In one joint, a defect was cut into the surface of a J-shaped seal where sections of insulation meet inside the rocket casing. The defect could let hot gas penetrate the insulation and hit the innermost of three O-rings. In the short-duration tests, the defect sealed itself during firing and gas did not reach the O-ring. In another joint a small `` blowhole'' was created in the adhesive that binds the insulation to the rocket casing. In short-duration tests, hot gases have followed the blowhole to a new O-ring, but have not gone beyond it. The test comes at a critical time for <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>. The company is <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s sole supplier of booster rockets, and views a successful launch as a sign the stigma of the Challenger tragedy can be set aside. While praising <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>'s work in the redesign effort, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> also has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a $ 1.2 million government plant to build its own boosters. Though not related to the shuttle program, the company's image also was tarnished by the deaths of five employees in a Dec. 29 fire that destroyed a first-stage MX missile rocket motor. State safety inspectors cited <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> for alleged safety violations, which are being contested by the company. But both <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> investigators concluded the workers violated company safety rules by being in the building during a critical stage of the fueling process that normally is carried out by remote control. <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said confidence at the company remains high. `` The morale here is extremely good as far as the redesign and success we've had to date,'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. `` What most people do n't realize is this redesign effort is about three times as intricate as the original design process, and is being completed in half the time.

<HEAD>Florida To Seed Keys Waters With 10,000 Baby Conchs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 State marine biologists plan to salt the waters off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> this summer with 10,000 baby queen conchs in hopes of rebuilding the population of shellfish that gave the Keys their nickname _ the <LOCATION> Conch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The goal is a conch population large enough to allow private and commercial fisherman to again harvest the key ingredient for conch chowder and conch fritters. It's unknown if the year-old seedlings, raised under controlled conditions, will survive in Keys waters. `` Hopefully, our project will be the start of a continuous seeding program in which we will be putting 50,000 conch into the water each year,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> seeding project. Queen conch had become so rare in the Keys two years ago that former state Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of Key West obtained a state ban on harvesting and a $ 265,000 grant for the reseeding program. Over-harvesting was the main reason the shellfish were endangered in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Since the ban, most of the conch meat has been shipped to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> from places such as <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. Last year, according to <LOCATION> Berg </LOCATION>, 1.73 million pounds were imported _ about 8 million conchs. Each of the seedlings has been tagged so its progress can be monitored. <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said it takes three to four years for a conch to reach maturity.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to `` send our own message to people who kill cops'' by passing legislation providing for the death penalty for the slaying of officers enforcing drug laws. The president spoke at a memorial ceremony for police officers and others who have lost their lives in the line of duty while investigating illegal drug trafficking. `` Six months ago I sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> legislation which says that when narcotics racketeers kill and are convicted they will face execution,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved similar legislation in 1986, but neither the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> judiciary committees has taken up his measure this year. `` It is time to back up the rhetoric on the drug problem with action, and I call on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to vote promptly on my bill providing for capital punishment when a death results from drug dealing and when a Drug Enforcement Administration or other law enforcement officer is murdered,'' the president said. `` When drug syndicates commit murder, our sympathy should be with the victims, not the killers,'' he said. `` It's time for us to send our own message to people who kill cops.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said that liberal politicians and others who took a permissive attitude toward drugs in the 1960s share the blame for the deaths of officers enforcing the drug laws now. `` Some liberal politicians decried our restrictions on drugs as conservative, moralistic, reactionary and old fashioned, or simply remained silent that there even was a drug problem,'' he said. `` Many universities adopted a hands-off attitude toward so-called recreational drug use, and the entertainment industry produced films and music that promoted and legitimized drug use,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` The truth was that drugs are killers but for nearly a generation this vital message was ignored by a whole group of people who should have known better.'' `` The leaders of that destructive generation remain the forgotten accomplices in the epidemic of illegal drug use,'' he said. `` They can not escape blame when a law enforcement officer dies in the battle.'' The ceremony, held in a White House office building, was attended by law enforcement officers, families of slain officers and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. At one point, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> led the group in a moment of silence, and then said, `` Amen. We rededicate ourselves to continue their struggle.'' First lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has campaigned actively against drug use, joined her husband on the platform, but did not speak. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a federal drug enforcement agent who was wounded during a heroin investigation near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in which two of his colleagues were killed, told the group that his fellow agents `` were victims of society's demand to satisfy their desire for drugs.'' `` Not until people quit using drugs will it become safe for those of us in law enforcement and the rest of society,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Reagan's 1984 Campaign Fined</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> fined President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s campaign committee $ 10,000 for accepting excessive contributions in the 1984 primary election, newly released records show. The commission is winding up its work on the 1984 election, and documents released Monday include a Jan. 26 settlement signed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> committee. An audit by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> found that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accepted more than the $ 1,000 maximum from 285 individuals, for a total of $ 193,674 in excess receipts. Of that, the campaign transferred $ 172,624 into a fund used to comply with various <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> regulations in the general election. But such a transfer is legal only if the donors give written permission, which was not obtained in the case of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s campaign, the commission report said Most of the rest of the money was refunded to the donors, `` although not within a reasonable time,'' according to the settlement agreement signed by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> committee treasurer, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Five thousand dollars was later listed in the names of spouses of original donors, but that procedure, too, requires written authorization from the contributors and spouses, and the authorization was not given. Spending and contribution limits apply to all candidates who receive federal matching funds for their presidential campaigns. The two party nominees for the general election receive all their campaign funds from the federal pot and do not have to raise any money on their own. In the primary elections, however, they must raise money privately that can be matched from the federal fund. The fund is supported by the voluntary $ 1 checkoff on income tax returns. This year, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> will give the Democratic and Republican nominees $ 27 million each for the general election campaign.

 A polka dot dress, bullets taken from victims and a hand-scrawled notation that `` RFK must die'' were among pieces of evidence put on display today as officials opened secret records on the assassination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The exhibits mounted on boards and in glass cases were samples of the voluminous files examined by state archivists and were put on display to illustrate key points in the investigation as authorities released the material. The police files on <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s shooting could shed new light on persistent questions about whether <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishara </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> was the only gunman in the shooting. Was <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> shot from in front or behind? Were there eight shots or more in the pantry of the Ambassador Hotel? And how close was the gunman whose bullet found its fatal path into <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s brain? Those questions and others raised by conspiracy theorists and scholars may be addressed in some 50,000 pages of documents, interviews with 4,000 witnesses, and 2,500 photographs being released today by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Secretary of State March <PERSON> Fong </PERSON> <PERSON> Eu </PERSON>. `` It has been almost 20 years since that awful night at the Ambassador -LRB- Hotel -RRB-, a night which ended one life and changed so many others,'' <PERSON> Eu </PERSON> said as she formally ordered the materials made public. Among the disputed facts verified by the documents was an admission by police that they destroyed key evidence in the case, including ceiling tiles, a door jamb and thousands of photographs taken in the Ambassador Hotel kitchen where <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was shot on June 5, 1968. An official record in the evidence showed that 2,410 photographs were burned on Aug. 21, 1968. It gives no reason for their burning. The polka dot dress was one of many purchased by police in an effort to jog the memories of witnesses on a point of contention _ whether a girl in a polka dot dress was seen running from the Ambassador Hotel shouting, `` We shot him.'' That report was never verified. One entire case of evidence contained items from Sirhan's <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> home Among the items was the now-famous diary in which <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> scrawled in pencil his plans to kill the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> senator. `` My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more the more of an unshakeable obsession,'' he wrote. Under a series of doodles was the statement, `` RFK must die.'' Also included was sign-in sheet from a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> gun club which showed that <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> visited there on June 4, 1968. The key question is whether <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, a Jordanian immigrant serving a life sentence for the crime, was the lone assassin of the Democratic presidential hopeful. On the eve of the release of the files, <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> McKissack </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> expects nothing to contradict his frequently-stated claim that he was a lone gunman. <PERSON> McKissack </PERSON> said that although <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> maintains he does n't remember shooting <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> believes he was motivated by anger over the Arab loss in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war <PERSON> McKissack </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, who is serving his sentence at <LOCATION> Soledad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, has given up hope that he will ever be paroled. Eu and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Archivist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> say they hope the release of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigative file will satisfy the public's right to know everything about the event. `` There should no longer be any speculation about what the police found,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. The release follows years of demands for public access to the information. `` This is a kind of vindication of citizens' efforts to force this material out,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a political scientist on leave from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> who has devoted himself to studying <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s killing. Stone equated its importance with the 1964 publication of the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of the assassination of President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s brother. The only things withheld from disclosure, <LOCATION> Eu </LOCATION> said, were autopsy photos, criminal `` rap sheets'' and fingerprint cards, juvenile case records, internal police personnel records and records that originated with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> or police departments outside <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>'. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would release its own file at an unspecified time. <ORGANIZATION> Eu </ORGANIZATION>'s spokeswoman, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, said her office had been inundated with calls since announcing the impending release, including many from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s home state, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which he represented as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator. A summary of <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> files released in 1986 contained a police conclusion tht <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> was the lone assassin. It found no evidence of a second gunman or a conspiracy. <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> admitted the killing at his 1969 trial but has claimed he has no memory of the actual shooting. He blames his memory loss on alcohol. Names and details considered sensitive at the time were deleted from the 1986 summary. It did not fully address questions raised about forensic evidence involving the gun, autopsy reports and witness recollections. Witnesses told of seeing <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> step from behind a steam table into <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s path as the senator walked toward him. But <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Noguchi </PERSON> testified at <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>'s trial that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was killed by a shot fired behind his right ear. Conspiracy theorists suggested that a second gunman fired at Kennedy from behind while <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> stood in front of him.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships and helicopters today searched for a missing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attacked two neutral ships and more mines were sighted in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed it had shot down the helicopter during a sea battle that raged Monday over much of the southern gulf. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> fired five land-based missiles at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships during Monday's fighting, in which American forces destroyed two Iranian oil platforms and blasted six Iranian vessels. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers identified the missiles as Chinese-made Silkworms but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it had yet to confirm what kind of missiles whistled past the warships. Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, told President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders that there was no evidence <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had fired any Silkworms, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. In avoiding the missiles, the three-ship convoy led by the USS <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> took evasive action and fired chaff into the air, which confused the rockets' radar guidance system and caused the missiles to miss the convoy in the southern gulf. Monday's confrontation was the most serious between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Iranian forces since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sent its task force to the gulf last year. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today said the gulf `` seems to be quieting down.'' Gulf-based maritime salvage experts reported the Iranians attacked two tankers in the Strait of Hormuz today. Monday they fired on three neutral ships. The salvage experts said one of the two tankers put out a distress signal at midmorning and gave its name as <PERSON> Meltem </PERSON>. They could not secure additional details. The other tanker, the 12,125-ton Fal-5 from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, was set ablaze but <LOCATION> Omani </LOCATION> coastguard patrol boats rescued the crew. Mines were spoted by a passing vessel in a central gulf area where no explosives had earlier been noted, and shipping executives predicted commercial vessels would be discouraged from sailing in the region. Sources close to the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said the convoys of 11 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reflagged Kuwaiti tankers sailing under <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> protection were discontinued until a major shipping channel further north was cleared. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> denied that the convoys had been suspended. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> raids on the Iranian oil platforms came in retaliation for a mine strike last Thursday against the USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, which injured 10 crewmen. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said several people were killed or injured in the raids on the two oil platforms but gave no further details. It has denying planting the mines. No American casualties were reported in Monday's fighting. However, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was searching for a Cobra attack helicopter with two crewmen that had not returned to a cruiser. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said Monday night that Iranian warships `` in a heroic clash with the aggressor American helicopters in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> shot down one of them Monday afternoon.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said the helicopter did not return to the USS Wainwright Monday after a `` routine reconnaissance mission.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> identified the helicopter crew as Capt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and Capt. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. They were assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. In its latest report on Monday's fighting, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed Iranian gunboats sank a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ship Monday in the southern gulf. `` Iranian speedboats spotted and scored direct hits on an American naval logistical ship sailing in the region, sinking the vessel with all its crew aboard,'' the agency said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> reiterated today that there were no confirmed casualties Monday. Asked about the Iranian report of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ship being sunk, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said: `` No report has reached us from our forces in the gulf of any hostile acts today.'' The missile attack Monday represented the first reported firing of the Silkworm batteries along <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s coast at ships in the southern gulf or the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the waterway's narrow entrance. The attack was witnessed by <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON> who was aboard the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> with a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news media pool. Fighting began early Monday when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> blasted two Iranian oil platforms as a `` measured response'' to mining of the Roberts. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces then sank an Iranian gunboat defending the platforms. Later Monday, two Iranian navy frigates fired on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets, which then bombed the ships, setting them afire near the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships also sank one and damaged two other patrol boats attacking neutral shipping near the <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> oil field, off the emirate of <LOCATION> Sharjah </LOCATION> in the southern gulf. During the raid at <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, Iranian forces attacked American, British and <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> merchant vessels and a press helicopter. About an hour after midnight Sunday, two groups of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships struck the Iranian oil platforms <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION> and Sirri-D, 100 miles apart in the southern gulf. One platform was destroyed by naval gunfire and the other by explosives placed on it by <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, according to statements in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter was fired upon during the raid on the platforms but not hit. Iranians shot at a press helicopter carrying an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> crew and <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiller </PERSON>, but missed. <PERSON> Schiller </PERSON> reported today that the <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION> and Sirri-D platforms had been reduced to charred ruins and appeared abandoned after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack. After the platform attack, an Iranian patrol boat fired at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruiser <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON>, one of the attacking ships, but missed. The frigate <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> sank the Iranian boat, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. In late afternoon, the Iranian frigates, the <LOCATION> Sahand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Sabalan </LOCATION>, were hit by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bombs and missiles after they fired on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, seeking `` signs of things to come,'' squared off against <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a raucous <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary Tuesday as he bid for control over the race for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> hoped for an upset that would propel his candidacy through the final six weeks of primaries, while Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> struggled simply to survive. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s millions rendered their primary verdict while <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators met behind closed doors in the Capitol to select 43 delegates to the party's national convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won 13 pledges and outdueled <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who gained six as well as his own. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was shut out, with the majority of senators remaining uncommitted. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the winner for sure on the Republican ballot, with no serious opposition in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or elsewhere. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> offered 96 delegates for the vice president, steadily closing in on the 1,139 needed to secure his nomination at the Republican National Convention in August. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was the biggest single-state primary night so far this year, offering 255 delegates and a shining opportunity for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to assert control over the Democratic race. He'd won two primaries and two caucuses since his stinging defeat to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> three weeks ago. In the next few weeks, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' primary prospects appeared bright. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> offered <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> an unusually high percentage of black voters that wo n't be available to him in upcoming states. And already there was talk of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> skipping <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> next week; that would leave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the only white candidate in the race. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> began the day leading in the competition for national convention delegates. The Associated Press count showed the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor with 880 delegates, to 745 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and 419 for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. It takes 2,082 to gain the nomination at the party convention. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary campaign proved to be a ferocious affair that exposed deep racial and religious divisions among New Yorkers, featuring an almost daily tongue-lashing from Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> directed at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sought to remain above the fray, although he said on the day before the primary that `` we have received more death threats in this campaign than in all the other combined because the climate has been so divisive and so violent.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> hailed a solid victory over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> caucuses on Monday and said it was a sign of things to come. `` <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> was the hors d'oeuvre, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is a four-course meal,'' he said. He campaigned through the morning of primary day in hopes of boosting turnout in predominantly black areas in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> where his support was strongest. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> greeted morning commuters at a subway stop in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to spend the day. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was a distant third in public opinion surveys, despite a costly effort designed to reinvigorate a campaign that has been moribund since Super Tuesday six weeks ago. He spent primary morning campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as aides passed the word that they expected the senator to gain less than 10 percent of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> vote _ a performance that would raise questions about his ability to continue. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, normally the most cautious of candidates, predicted in the final hours of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign that he would score a victory that would place him firmly on the path toward the nomination. `` It's been a terrific, exciting, interesting couple of weeks and I hope if all goes well today, a sign of things to come,'' he said. Interesting hardly began to describe the multi-million dollar campaign to appeal to the state's many and far-flung ethnic and religious groups. The state's two prominent Democrats captured their share of the limelight: <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> when he was n't attacking <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and Gov <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> declined to endorse anyone while finally ruling out accepting a draft.

<HEAD>NEW YORK: a draft.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 At times, it seemed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> were mere bystanders peering into the ever-bubbling <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> political cauldron. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> played the role of emcee, meeting with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, speaking nicely of them as well as <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, but not endorsing anyone. Some divined a preference for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>; when <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> urged party leaders to express a preference for a candidate, many of them flocked to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's side. But there was confusion aplenty when the governor and his aides offered multiple explanations of whether he would accept a draft at the party nomination convention. Asked if he would utter a simple yes or no answer to the question, he replied, `` Yes or no.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> provided much of the fireworks, first saying that Jews would have to be `` crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, then saying that the former civil rights leader `` under stress is not capable of telling the truth.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who ardently sought <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s backing in hopes of cutting into <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support among Jews and other residents of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, declared by the end of the campaign that the mayor was `` speaking for himself.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, returned fire. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, he said, `` is a lunatic.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wanted none of that fight, but he had trials of his own. He was upbraided at one campaign stop in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> for not doing more to contest <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for black votes, and spent several hours ducking reporters one day who wanted to ask him about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's decision to bomb Iranian oil platforms in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. He was thrown off-stride briefly when he refused to rule out creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, and again when <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> pounced upon a remark concerning the possible use of nuclear weapons in the event of a Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> watched from a distance. He divided time between next week's primary state of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he attended official meetings on the Iranian military situation. `` I ca n't wait for the debates with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee no matter who it turns out to be,'' he said. `` Even if they unleash <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, I ca n't wait.''

<TEXT>
 A citizens' group, concerned that a new type of discrimination will evolve once scientists have cracked the human genetic code, proposed Tuesday that a federal commission be established to advise on how to control the new gene technology. <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trends </ORGANIZATION> and an active opponent of some biological research projects, said he is organizing the citizens' group as a result of plans for the government to finance research that would map the human genetic code. The genetic code forms the blueprint for all human physical characteristics. It determines why some people have blue eyes and blond hair, and others have brown hair and brown eyes. It also gives a predisposition for some illnesses and disabilities. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said that once the genetic code, or genome, is known there is a possibility that this will be used by employers, insurance companies and others to discriminate against people whose genetic make up includes potential disease-causing defects. `` A new kind of discrimination will arise, not based on skin color, but on genetic makeup,'' <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` We do n't want to see the emergence of a commercial genetic discrimination in this country.'' <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said his group is proposing that organizing and financing a citizens' commission on genetic ethics be a part of any legislation that would finance research on the human genome. Earlier this year the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> proposed that the government finance a $ 3 billion effort to map the function of the 100,000 genes that make up the human genetic code. The project is now being considered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said funds should not be provided for the scientific research unless money also is appropriated to control the application of knowledge developed by the technical research. Without such controls, he said, `` we face the very real possibility of a new form of eugenics in this country.'' Eugenics is the concept of improving the human species by controlling hereditary factors through controlled mating or through genetics. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said some legislators have agreed to introduce legislation requiring the genetics advisory board, but he declined to name sponsors of the legislation. He said the commission is supported by what he said were `` 70 prominent national leaders'' of civil rights, labor, disability rights and religious groups. Seven representatives from those groups attended the news conference. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> attorney and a disability rights activists, said the genetics research could be used by employers to exclude some people from jobs. She said many disabled workers now are denied jobs for medical reasons and the genetic technology `` could provide more sophisticated means of screening people out of jobs that they could do.'' This would be done, she said, by labeling people based on their genetic potential for illness or disability. `` There are too many labels now,'' she said, `` and this will give us still more labels we can apply to people.'' Rabbi <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Saperstein </PERSON>, representing a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> center of reform <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, said new knowledge such as the genetic code must be carefully applied because there no longer is room for technological error. `` This is the first generation of humanity that does not have the benefit of making mistakes in applying technology,'' he said. `` All of human history is a test run for this moment.'' He said that because of the eugenics experiments conducted on Jews by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in World War II his religious community is particularly sensitive to the application of new genetic knowledge. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said the proposed commission, to be called the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, would comprise 12 members, six each selected by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He said the board would appoint a committee of 18 that broadly would represent all special interest groups concerned with issues of genetics. He said the proposal would include an appropriation of $ 3.5 million to finance the work of the board and the committee.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS JACK WILLIAMS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The warning `` Silkworm incoming!'' blared five times from the bridge of the USS Jack Williams but all five Iranian missiles missed the three-ship <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> attack group. The missiles flew from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s anti-ship missile batteries Monday as the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> attacked two Iranian oil platforms in the southern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in retaliation for a mine that blew a hole in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate last week. Officers on the Williams, which led the `` surface action group,'' identified the missiles as Chinese-built Silkworms but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, did not confirm it. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it was still analyzing the attack. With the first warning of `` Silkworm incoming!'' the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> lurched into violent maneuvers and crewmen scrambled. `` Everybody look astern! Everybody look astern!'' Lt. <PERSON> Augustino </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponturier </PERSON>, officer of the deck, shouted to junior officers and lookouts. The guided missile frigate rolled sharply and pointed its stern toward the approaching missile, presenting its smallest target and allowing the aluminum-chaff launchers and other defensive weapons a clear shot. None of the first four rockets came close enough to be seen but members of a helicopter crew and a fire detail hit the deck as the fifth crossed behind the ship and slammed into a distant oil rig with an orange-yellow flash. Officers aboard the ship were elated with the response system. `` Not one of these ladies has a scratch on her, and the other guys ca n't say that,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>, operational commander of the force. In all, six Iranian ships were damaged by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fire Monday. <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> said a C-130 aircraft spotting targets for the Iranian batteries was tracked by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Enterprise and was almost shot down. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials reported one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter with two crew members aboard missing Monday, and the search continued Tuesday. They denied Iranian claims that the aircraft was shot down. The Williams, with members of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news media pool aboard, was the operational flagship for one of the three `` surface action groups'' involved in the fighting Monday in the southern gulf. Also in the group were the destroyers <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. Monday's operations began when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships destroyed two Iranian oil platforms. Over the next few hours, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces sank two missile-armed patrol boats, damaged two others and bombed and rocketed two frigates. One of the Iranian frigates, the <LOCATION> Sahand </LOCATION>, was hit by a Harpoon missile fired from the <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>. The white missile roared skyward in a cloud of smoke and streaked for the horizon. The men on the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' bridge cheered: `` Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!'' A flash and white smoke erupted on the horizon, followed by a long series of heavy explosions as the weapons and ammunition aboard the Sahand blew up. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION>, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilot who observed the Sahand reported it `` listing badly, with a big hole in its port side, the superstructure on fire and a lifeboat with some survivors in the water.'' Soon afterward, F-14 jet fighters from the Enterprise attacked the Sahand's sister frigate Sabalan after it fired a missile at them. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Willey </PERSON>, a Central Command officer accompanying the media pool, described the view from the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> bridge as `` both spectacular and frightening _ contrails from missiles could be seen in almost every direction.'' The oil platform attacks were aimed at what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials called military targets. Both the <LOCATION> Sassan </LOCATION> and Sirri-D platforms have been used by for military purposes, they say. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the strikes after the frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> hit a mine, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say was laid by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, in the central gulf last Thursday. Ten crewman were wounded. While other groups attacked the platforms, the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' unit steamed halfway through the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, in calm seas, under clear skies within range of Iranian Silkworm batteries that had not yet been used in the southern gulf. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said the mission was to `` exercise the right of innocent transit passage and respond to all contingencies.'' That's when the missiles came. As the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and its accompanying warships sailed out of the `` Silkworm envelope'' later Monday, into safer waters and a setting sun, the alert level was lowered from `` general quarters'' to the next lowest `` condition one-alpha.'' Ponturier, of <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, took off his steel helmet and walked toward the door. `` It's <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> time,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> might veto a massive trade bill now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but that action would n't directly affect the free-trade agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` There's nothing that tells me that they're connected,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. If there is a veto of the sweeping trade bill, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto message would `` describe some reasons that have nothing whatsoever to do with the free trade agreement with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, as far as I can see.'' Lawmakers are near final action on the 1,000-page trade bill, but there have been veto threats over parts the administration find objectionable, including a provision that would require 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. The U.S.-Canada trade pact was signed Jan. 2 but still requires approval by the Canadian parliament and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. If approved, the treaty will take effect Jan. 1, 1989, and will gradually eliminate all tariffs between the two countries and address non-tariff barriers. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, U.S-Canada trade was about $ 124 billion in 1986, of which $ 4.6 billion was agricultural. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> appeared at a news conference with Canadian minister of agriculture, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, following private discussions. Wise said he was pleased by <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s view of the trade bill and said there is `` the absolute need and the absolute necessity for us to join forces'' in ongoing global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. `` In fact, I think, were it not for the leadership taken by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... we probably would n't be at the stage that we are now in the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of multinational trade negotiations,'' Wise said. Both he and <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said the U.S.-Canada free-trade agreement would help push the cause of global reform. `` It would be extremely helpful, I think, to both of us, in sending a very legitimate and a very concrete message to our other trading partners, particularly at <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>,'' Wise said. In a joint statement later, the two agricultural leaders pledged to work together `` to ensure that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> ministerial meeting in May and the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> economic summit in June provide the necessary political impetus'' for a midterm review of the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION> next December in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> refused to specutlate today on the fate of a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopter and its two-man crew missing since American encounters Monday with Iranian forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Nor would he comment on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s claims that its forces had brought the craft down. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, asked as he left a memorial service for police officers and others killed enforcing drug laws whether the copter was considered lost, answered: `` I'm not going to speculate. We're continuing to look, and I'm certainly hopeful. Asked about Iranian claims that its forces had shot the helicopter down, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> replied, `` I'm not going to get into the details.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, changed the status of the helicopter's two crewmen to missing. Pentagon Spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> identified them as Capt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>, 30, and Capt. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 33, assigned to Squadron HMLA-167 based at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> claims a home of record of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> a home of record of <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> repeated statements of Monday that the Cobra had been sent out on a `` standard patrol sweep'' and that there was no evidence to suggest the copter had ever come under fire. As he commented, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and planes continued to search for the Marine Cobra attack helicopter over the central gulf. The helicopter did not return to the USS Wainwright Monday after what <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials called a `` routine reconnaissance mission.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday night that Iranian warships, `` in a heroic clash with the aggressor American helicopters in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> shot down one of them Monday afternoon.'' Addressing the search, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Maj. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, said today: `` There is a very extensive search underway. Numerous ships and helicopters are involved. The airborne search stopped during the night and resumed at daylight, but numerous surface ships kept searching during the night.'' The helicopter was in the lower central portion of the gulf, near the area of Monday's heaviest fighting, when it disappeared, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, which was not releasing the names of the two crewmen. Another Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col., <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, said the helicopter was assigned to the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> as part of the Marine task force protecting <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil tankers in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The helicopter was operating temporarily from the <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON>, a cruiser, he said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he did not know what radio contact there had been with the helicopter. No American casualties were reported in the initial attacks on Iranian positions and the later return fire from Iranian speed boats and land-based missiles.

<TEXT>
 European leaders Tuesday denounced mine-laying in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, while Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> went further and delivered a strong defense of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliatory action against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` I'm in favor of action against those who lay mines against shipping in the gulf ... and not letting people get away with constantly causing extra trouble on what should be a free international seaway,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, adding: `` I fully support the action which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> took.'' A <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> government spokesman said <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> `` is concerned by the sudden renewal of tension in the gulf.'' Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said: `` We reaffirm our commitment to freedom of navigation in the gulf and demand that the mining stop'' along with `` all other acts hostile to navigation in international waters.'' In reply to a question, he said attacks on merchant shipping `` can only lead to measures of self-defense.'' Italian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> said: `` Laying mines is an illegal act, which puts navigation at risk.'' He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack on an Iranian oil platform and an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> counterattack, `` correspond with the hard logic of military action and reaction.'' An Iranian diplomat said the accusation that his country planted the mines was `` such an absurd thing that one does not have to deny it.'' He implied <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was the culprit, because disruption of gulf shipping served Iraqi interests. `` It was <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that attacked the shipping in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> -LRB- and -RRB- invited foreign forces to the area ... in order to divert the attention from the main problem on the battleground,'' said <PERSON> Akhunzadeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Basti </PERSON>, the Iranian charge d'affaires in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio interview. Asked whether <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would attack <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> targets again, he replied: `` By these actions, they -LRB- <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> -RRB- openly committed themselves, or they made an alliance with the Iraqis. So we see now the Americans are directly supporting <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in a defeated war and if that is their position, of course there will be countermeasures.'' <PERSON> Basti </PERSON> was summoned to by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> who protested about the mining and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s attack on the <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> a British-owned tanker on lease to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Frankfurter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundschau </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said that militarily, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` can be satisfied with the results of the attacks against two Iranian oil platforms in the gulf.'' However, it said, `` in another way the attack did not work as planned in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'' because <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> responded to the action by attacking the <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>. `` This means a dangerous escalation of the already tense situation between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the gulf, and confirms the fears of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could be drawn into a broad military conflict in the gulf,'' the paper said.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Incest to Blame for High Infant Mortality in
Turkmenia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet newspaper on Tuesday blamed high infant mortality in the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION> on widespread incest among rural residents who intermarry to avoid paying huge dowries demanded by tradition. The youth newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> quoted a doctor in the village of <LOCATION> Yagtylyk </LOCATION> as saying that at one nearby collective farm, there are 90 families in which the parents are close relatives, and 71 of them had borne children who died within a year. The newspaper did not make clear how much of the republic's high incidence of infant mortality was attributable to incest, but said it was `` a high percentage.'' A Soviet sociology journal last year reported that the infant mortality rate in <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION> is more than twice the Soviet national average, which itself ranks 50th in the world, behind most developed countries. The journal, <ORGANIZATION> Sociological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, said 58.2 of every 1,000 children born in the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> republic die within a year. The national infant mortality rate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1986 was 25.4 per 1,000. Infant mortality in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that year was 10.4 per 1,000 births. `` They knock us doctors for the high infant mortality rate,'' <PERSON> Khodzhamurad </PERSON> <PERSON> Makhemov </PERSON>, a pediatric specialist in <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>'s Takhtinsky region told the newspaper `` Yet we are powerless in the case of the death of a child of related parents.'' The report referred to the case of a 30-year-old woman in the region who married her first cousin and gave birth to eight children. Five of them died before reaching age one. <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said 164 cases of infant mortality attributable to incest had been found in the one village, <LOCATION> Yagtylyk </LOCATION>, the population of which was not given and is too small to be included in the annual national economic report. The article speculated, however, that a similar situation existed throughout the rural regions of the republic of about 3.3 million people. Intermarriage in the republic has not fallen off in recent years, the newspaper said, blaming the practice on `` those who support dowry ransoms, the buying and selling of Turkmenian girls.'' Rural families that can not afford to pay thousands of rubles to an outside family encourage their children to marry within, the newspaper said. The article quoted local marriage office workers as saying they are powerless to prevent intermarriage, and called for changes in the republic's legal code to deter close relatives from marrying. It noted, however, that traditions in rural regions are not so easily broken, and that many of the related couples who arrive at public offices to register their weddings do so only after they `` in fact have already become husband and wife.'' <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>, like most of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, is populated mostly by Moslems, who marry in religious ceremonies and register with Soviet authorities as a formality. The article, titled `` Marrying ... a Brother,'' also called on teachers and health care workers to inform rural residents of the genetic dangers involved in bearing children with a close relative.

 In a move to double its space, the <ORGANIZATION> Pierpont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> will buy, renovate and occupy a 136-year-old brownstone mansion next door, it was announced Tuesday. The research library and museum has agreed to pay the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which is moving its offices to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, $ 15 million for the mansion. `` One of the great appeals of the library has always been its intimate, human scale,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the library director, said. `` People should be reassured that we have no intention of undermining this.'' The mansion, in <LOCATION> midtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, will provide space for exhibitions, storage, educational programs and offices, he said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON>, associate director, said the library may use its archive of <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> family possessions, including furniture and decorations, to create some period rooms. In all, the library will spend about $ 5 million restoring and renovating the house. The mansion was built in 1852 as the residence of <PERSON> Anson </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, a financier and heir to the <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> copper fortune. In 1904 it was bought by <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierpont </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> as a home for his son, <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jr </ORGANIZATION>. The elder <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> had lived in a brownstone next door since 1880. The 45-room house, which has 22 fireplaces and 12 baths, was purchased after <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION>'s death by the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which added a five-story annex in 1957. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> began his art collection while a student in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, gathering bits of glass from the shattered windows of old churches and cathedrals. In 1906 <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> built a library to store his collection, and in 1928 his son built an annex on the site of <ORGANIZATION> Pierpont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION>'s home. The library, a national historic landmark since 1966, was designed by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Follen </PERSON> <PERSON> McKim </PERSON> and built of fitted marble blocks. The library prides itself on its collections of medieval and Renaissance illuminated manuscripts, master drawings, early printed books and bookbindings. The collection includes three Gutenberg Bibles, a 1477 printing of <PERSON> Chaucer </PERSON>'s `` Canterbury Tales,'' the original manuscript of <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' `` A Christmas Carol'' and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON>'s own copy of the first edition of `` Frankenstein.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> called on Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for talks when he visits the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> later this month. `` I think it would be helpful for us, and I think it could be helpful also for the Soviets,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in a joint interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and the German news agency <ORGANIZATION> DPA </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader's statements represented a marked change from hard-line statements earlier this year that warned of the dangers of Soviet involvement in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had signaled their intentions to visit the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in the coming weeks although details had not been finalized. `` We know about some intentions of both of them to do something about the unrest -LRB- in the Israeli-occupied territories -RRB-, about peace in our area, but we do n't know details of their next steps,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. He said he would respond favorably to a visit of a high-ranking Soviet official such as <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, adding: `` We would welcome it, and we will be willing to talk with him.'' Speaking Sunday in his office at the prime ministry, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> stressed that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was the key to efforts aimed at rekindling a peace process in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Asked if the Soviets and Americans could work together on a peace shuttle, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said, `` I think first of all they have to work with us. We are the most important partner in such an effort.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also said he wanted to discuss with <PERSON> Shevardadnze </PERSON> the normalizing of relations, which were broken by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, as well as the emigration of Soviet Jews. `` For us, it's important to have an opportunity to present our positions, our views about the necessity for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to establish normal relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and also to try to convince the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to change its policy regarding Jewish emigration,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. As a precondition for Soviet involvement in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peacemaking, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has demanded restoration of relations and free immigration for the 380,000 Jews who <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> claims want to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Independence Day, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are to sign a new memorandum of understanding that calls for strategic cooperation in political and military spheres. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the pact would affirm existing agreements and stressed it was not an anti-Soviet agreement, adding: `` There is not any new element in this memo, but it institutionalizes all the existing agreements.'' The 73-year-old Israeli premier defended <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s use of force in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, saying it had reduced the scope of the rioting in recent weeks. `` I think there is a certain improvement, and I hope it will go on because I imagine that many Palestinian Arabs understand that this way of violence will not help any cause,'' he said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he was `` not ready'' to comment on statements by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces assassinated <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s head of military operations, who was killed in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> on Saturday. The influence of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the refusal of moderate Palestinians to speak with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were cited by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as reasons for a lack of a solution. `` One of the important reasons for the Palestinian tragedy since the beginning of the century is their being exposed to influences from outside,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. He said it was his belief that the 1.5 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were `` not yet ripe'' to handle their own affairs and deal directly with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` They've always relied more on Arab factors from outside and when there was a local leadership, it was always an extreme, violent minority, and this situation still exists,'' he said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he believed the future of the occupied territories, which were captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1967, would be `` one of the main subjects'' in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s November general elections. He indicated elections may again result in a national unity government, a coalition like the one that has shared power since the 1984 balloting ended in stalemate. Even though <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have fought frequently, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said a large part of the populace favored such a coalition. `` I hope that if such a situation will arise, we will find ways to make it better than this time,'' he said.

 A self-educated janitor who wore his lawyer's hand-me-downs and lived frugally while investing in the stock market has left at least $ 600,000 to the college where he mopped floors for 30 years. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON>, who died March 22 at age 82, had amassed $ 1 million with investment knowledge gleaned in part from discussions with professors and from economics classes he audited at <ORGANIZATION> Bethany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you saw him and talked with him, noticed his demeanor and the way he dressed, you might confuse him with, the only word thing I can think of is, a bum,'' said his lawyer, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gompers </PERSON> of Wheeling. `` But he was n't. He was a warm, compassionate person who cared about people. I would give him some of my old clothes to wear. If I did n't, I know he would never buy any for himself.'' <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> lived frugally, investing money from the sale of his share of the family dairy farm in 1953 to his late brother, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, along with wages from the private, 800-student college in northern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. He worked at <LOCATION> Bethany </LOCATION> from 1953 to 1983. `` He knew the stock market inside and out. He was always at the college library reading The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> to follow the stock market,'' said <PERSON> Gompers </PERSON>. The college will receive an initial $ 600,000 from the estate, <PERSON> Gompers </PERSON> said. A trust fund for a disabled nephew will get $ 400,000, the balance of which will revert to the college on the nephew's death A niece and two other nephews each received $ 2,000. `` I never imagined he had that kind of money,'' said <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, dean of the faculty. `` I taught economics and business at <LOCATION> Bethany </LOCATION> for many years and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> would be sitting and waiting for my car to arrive and he wanted to talk about stocks,'' <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> said. `` He asked me general questions and I had no idea how much he was investing. I have no idea what his stock portfolio is either.'' <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> sat in on every lecture that <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gresham </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Bethany </LOCATION> president, gave on economics. He often asked <PERSON> Gresham </PERSON> about investments and asked what things at the college were worthy of support. What <PERSON> Gresham </PERSON> best remembers about <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> is how hard he worked. `` It was past time to quit many times when I saw him,'' <PERSON> Gresham </PERSON> said. `` It would sometimes be dark and he would still be working.'' <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> had lived at home on the family farm until 1953, a year after his mother's death. Strained relations with his brother led him to sell out. He never married. He lived above a garage where he kept old lawnmowers for parts to rebuild other mowers. He would spend money only when necessary. Associates said not much distracted him from his work, except mention of one particular former president. `` It was common knowledge that the way to get <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> really involved in a conversation, or to start an argument with him, was to mention former President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunnell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bethany </PERSON>'s director of financial aid. `` He had no use for FDR's ` New Deal.''' `` He despised <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Gompers </PERSON> said. `` He did n't like the idea of somebody being able to get something without working for it.''

<HEAD>House Votes Symbolic Approval of INF Treaty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 393-7 on Tuesday to place its symbolic stamp of approval on the new treaty banning medium-range nuclear weapons worldwide. The action has no practical effect since the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has exclusive rights to consent to the ratification of treaties. But it does put the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on record as overwhelmingly endorsing the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty shortly before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opens debate on the agreement. The resolution voicing support of the treaty, which was concluded by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December, also made a series of non-binding policy statements in which the House: _ Declared that the president should continue to provide a credible nuclear deterrent force, including maintaining nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to help ensure the security of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance _ Called on the president to provide leadership to strengthen <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s conventional forces and modernize the alliance's nuclear deterrent forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ Urged the administration to seek verifiable conventional arms agreements resulting in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact arms reductions in those areas where pact forces have superior strength _ Called for the creation of a comprehensive arms control strategy _ Endorsed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's effort to negotiate with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> effectively verifiable reductions in strategic, intercontinental nuclear forces _ Declared the president should act appropriately to deal with any Soviet violations of the new INF treaty, including withdrawing from it if the violations are serious _ Called on the president to propose ways of resolving existing alleged Soviet arms control violations `` and to address any future Soviet arms control violations in a decisive manner. The INF treaty requires the destruction of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missiles with a range of between 300 miles and 3,400 miles. It bans flight tests of any missiles within that range. And it provides for on-site inspection to verify compliance. Most such weapons are deployed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but the treaty imposes a worldwide ban. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution stated that the treaty sets an important precedent by requiring the Soviets to destroy more weapons than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in order to eliminate all such medium-range missiles. It applauded verification requirements as being `` extremely stringent.'' `` The INF Treaty vindicates the importance of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> security cooperation and illustrates the ability of the members in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to act in concert to accomplish meaningful reductions in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear arms,'' the resolution declared. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, R-Ind., one of the few <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members to speak against the treaty, said it should be rejected because the Soviets can cover European targets with long-range weapons, and because, he contended, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is certain to cheat `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sucks us into agreements and later violates them,'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> asserted. `` This is another tragic mistake.''

 A French warship spotted three mines and Iranian spe <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels. A marine executive said the gulf appeared `` ghostly'' from lack of shipping. He and others said commercial vessels were avoiding the waterway, where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980 and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sank or damaged six Iranian vessels Monday. They also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had suspended escorts of Kuwaiti oil tankers temporarily, but <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> denied it. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags and registration to 11 Kuwaiti tankers last year and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> escorts them through the gulf. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said things were quieter in the gulf Tuesday and `` we hope it continues that way.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed its speedboats in the southern gulf sank an `` American naval logistical ship,'' killing its crew, an hour after <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships destroyed two Iranian oil platforms Monday. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> headlined the dispatch `` Yankees Go Down To Watery Grave As Revolutionary Guards Sink <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Ship,'' but it contained no details. At the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said of the claim: `` No report has reached us from our forces in the Gulf of any hostile acts -LRB- against them -RRB- today.'' After the confrontation Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said there were no confirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> casualties but a search was being conducted for an missing AH-1 helicopter with two crewmen aboard. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed to have shot it down. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> lodged a formal complaint Tuesday about attacks by the `` war-monger'' <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> responded that its actions had been `` necessary and proportionate.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> also said an American attack Monday on the patrol boat Joshan killed 15 crew members and injured 29. In Monday's operations, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces destroyed two offshore Iranian oil platforms in the southern Gulf, then sank the <PERSON> Joshan </PERSON>, disabled two frigates and sank or damaged three attack boats. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attacked neutral commercial ships after the raid on the platform, which were in retaliation for a mine that damaged the frigate USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> last week and wounded 10 crewmen. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said Tuesday the <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> ambassador, who represents American interests in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and `` given a written warning in regard to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s aggressive attacks.'' It said the note `` emphasized that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will retaliate.'' Shipping executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the French warship spotted three mines in an area of the central gulf previously believed mine-free. No details were available. After midmorning distress signals from two tankers entering the narrow <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the southern gateway to the gulf, owners and agents advised their vessels to anchor just outside the gulf, off <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakkan </PERSON>, the executives said. They identified the two ships attacked as the Meltem, flying the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> flag, and the 12,215-ton Fal-5 from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. No details about the Meltem were available, but they said the Fal-5 was set ablaze and Omani coastguard boats rescued the crew. <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON>, in a report from shipboard, said a five Iranian missiles were fired from shore Monday at a three-ship `` surface action group.'' They were the first such attacks reported on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships. The three <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships took evasive action and fired chaff into the air, which confused the missiles' guidance systems and caused them to miss. One missile crossed behind the ships and hit a distant oil platform, which was not identified. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers identified the missiles as Chinese-made Silkworms, which are known to be based in and near the strait. The Pentagon said, however, that it had not confirmed the missile type. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> denied it, sources close to the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was halting excorts of the 11 reflagged tankers until further notice. No convoys had been reported under way this week, and the <PERSON> Kuwaitis </PERSON> said they were suspended after the <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> hit the mine last week. According to the sources, the mine was in a main channel off the <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> that leads to the northern gulf and a mine sweeping operation must be completed before convoys resume. Pentagon officials said the AH-1 Cobra helicopter did not return to the USS Wainwright on Monday after a `` routine reconnaissance mission.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the search continued Tuesday but the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> had formally changed the status of the two crewmen to missing. He identified them as Capt. <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> and Capt. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, assigned to Squadron HMLA-167 based at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>USDA Seeking Advice on Designing Wheat Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Public comments are being sought on how to design the 1989 wheat program, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. One the biggest decisions will be whether to include an acreage reduction program, or ARP, in next year's program. That involves how much of a farmer's wheat base must be idled in order to qualify for 1989 price supports and other program benefits.

 Prayers and songs filled the air Tuesday as thousands remembered the Jewish men and women who fought <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and died in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> ghetto 45 years ago. Late in the day, anti-Israeli <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> students marched to the main monument of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ghetto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation laid a wreath. The ceremony in which prayers, songs and flowers were offered in memory of the dead took place at midday on the broad plaza in front of the Ghetto Fighters Monument. At 4:30 p.m., about 25 Arab and African students arrived at the same site carrying banners criticizing Israeli conduct in the occupied territories of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. They were joined by a delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> diplomatic mission to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. As police looked on, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> group laid a wreath of white lillies two yards from the wreath presented by the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The wreath, draped with a colorful Arab scarf, said, `` From the fallen in the Palestinian uprising to the heroes of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto Uprising.'' Exactly 45 years ago Tuesday, heavily armed squadrons of Nazi troops entered the walled Jewish quarter of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, bent on the quick annihilation of the last 70,000 inhabitants. Instead, they were routed by the starving, poorly armed residents, who started a doomed three-week struggle. Before the main cerresenting veterans groups, Jewish communities worldwide and Polish organizations laid wreath after wreath of flowers at the foot of the monument, a bold relief of armed fighters crouched together facing their foes. The monument, near the city's heart, was the very first erected in the destroyed left bank of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> after the war. As a crowd of about 4,000 Poles and Israelis stood side by side under the leaden sky, a cantor sang Kaddish, the Jewish song of mourning. And Rabbi <PERSON> Isser </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> prayed for the victims of the ghetto and the Nazi Holocaust in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Later, when the Polish officials and military honor guard withdrew, Israelis in the crowd burst into singing of their national anthem, Hatikvah -LRB- The Hope -RRB-. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> do not have full-fledged diplomatic relations. Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Itzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Navon </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on a visit considered private, addressed the crowd and expressed thanks to Polish authorities for the ceremony. He also spoke of the Holocaust in which 6 million Jews were put to death in World War II, 3 million of them Polish Jews. `` We have to remember, yes, but not a paralyzing memory,'' he said in English. `` Not only remember the past, but we should derive a new determination from that tragedy to continue living.'' An assembly at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s Palace of Culture and Science took place later in the day, with speeches marking the anniversary. Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> was absent from the main ceremony, but met Tuesday with a delegation of the visiting Jewish leaders. About 3,000 people from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and around the world have come to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for the observances beginning April 14, fewer than the 4,500 originally expected. Jewish visitors to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> objected five years ago when <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> diplomats were allowed to lay flowers at the main ceremony marking the 40th anniversary of the ghetto uprising. This year, Polish officials did not invite diplomats to take part in the ceremony at the monument. But representatives of several nations held private wreath-layings later in the day. The last diplomatic group was led by deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shawki </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Omari </PERSON>. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> watched the scene and said afterward he had no objections to the wreath-laying. `` They have a right. I have no sympathy for terrorism, of course, but I have some sympathy for the Palestinian people. I think it was quite dignified,'' he said. The Polish state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, distributed a text of a letter from <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hijazi </PERSON> to Polish officials likening Nazi fascism in World War II to Israeli `` fascism'' in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The letter expressed `` deepest respect for the fallen of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> ghetto.''

 The body of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander assassinated in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> last week, was met in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on Tuesday by grieving relatives and competing factions of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The PLO-chartered plane carrying the body of <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, his wife, five children and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials touched down at <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> airport at 2:45 p.m. <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was not aboard the plane. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> saw the body off at <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> but stayed behind, apparently because of his feud with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON>, 52, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, was killed Saturday by armed commandos who burst into his home in suburban <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. The funeral was set for Wednesday. Israeli sources have said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security forces carried out the attack but the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government has refused to confirm this. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> have blamed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the assassination. <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> on Tuesday requested a special session of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to condemn the slaying. <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Fawzieh </PERSON>, hugged and kissed his wife, <PERSON> Intisar </PERSON>, as she stepped from the plane. <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON>'s sick father could not make it to the airport. Among those aboard the plane were five members of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, all members of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the backbone of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Also aboard were members of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> and the Moscow-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. The popular front and the democratic front are the main factions making up the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> were expelled from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> in June 1983 after a Syrian-backed mutiny in <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> ranks. <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Ramle </LOCATION>, which is now in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and had asked to be buried close to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. His mother and father live in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. Palestinian delegations at the airport rushed to embrace the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials as they stepped from the plane. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, who leads the popular front, took Mrs. <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> in his arms. Mrs. <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, wearing a black dress and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag scarf, emerged from the plane carrying a poster of her husband in one hand and flashing `` V'' for victory in the other. `` In soul, in blood we shall continue the march to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>,'' vowed Mrs. <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, flanked by her children, all wearing olive green military fatigues. About 30 Palestinian girl and boy scouts, some clad in <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flags and others in traditional Palestinian costumes, repeated Mrs. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s words, adding: `` There is no God but God. God loved Abu Jihad.'' The boy scouts, standing near the plane and carrying four wreaths including one from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, sang Palestinian revolutionary songs. <PERSON> Al-Wazir </PERSON>'s 21-year-old son, <PERSON> Bassil </PERSON>, vowed to avenge the loss of his father. `` My father's martyrdom means a new beginning, a new start, readiness and will to fight for the freedom of Palestine,'' <PERSON> Bassil </PERSON> told reporters in English. Representatives of <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s government and the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> government of King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> also were at the airport. Dozens of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> men carried <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>'s coffin, draped in a red, white, green and black Palestinian flag, out of the plane into a waiting ambulance an hour after its arrival. A Tunisian commission investigating the assassination has concluded that the operation was conducted by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> commandos. The Tunisian ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Tuesday the most conclusive piece of evidence was the presence of a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 aircraft with Israeli markings off the Tunisian coast at the time of the assassination. The plane used sophisticated electronic equipment to jam telecommunications around the town where <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> lived, he said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pranced, danced and rocked at an age when most kids are still molding Play Doh. An international star and millionaire by adolescence, his life has remained shrouded. His new autobiography, `` Moonwalk,'' hopes to rip through that cloak. It does n't. What we have here is a failure to titillate. The 283-page book, to be released this week by <PERSON> Doubleday </PERSON>, does not name lovers, explain the megastar's affection for the Elephant Man, detail massive plastic surgery and skin whitening, talk about the oxygen pressure chamber he purportedly wanted to prolong his life, or serve up any other delicious show biz dish. Rather, `` Moonwalk'' is a gentle excursion into the 24 years <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has spent as a performer. The title refers to the sliding dance step he popularized. `` I was interested in being able to talk about how I feel in a book that would be mine _ my words and my voice,'' the 29-year-old star says. `` I hope it will clear up some misconceptions.'' Misconceptions are as plentiful in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s life as screaming teen-agers at his concerts. The media, it seems, has not been kind to little <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. `` I do n't understand why they feel the need to make up things about me,'' he writes. `` I take some small pride in thinking that I've come out pretty well, all things considered. ... It's a difficult life. Very few manage any semblance of a normal childhood.'' He admits to having two nose jobs and a chin cleft. However, he said he has not had his cheeks or eyes altered or a skin peel. He acknowledges long-standing friendships with <PERSON> Tatum </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> _ but there is no kiss and tell. The closest he gets is a passage about a date with <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>. They went to a club in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> called On the Rox, and the young actress grabbed his hand. `` This probably would n't mean a lot to other people, but it was serious stuff to me. She touched me,'' he says in the book. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was asked to do the book in 1984 by two Doubleday editors _ <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, who wrote the dedication page, and <PERSON> Shaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Areheart </PERSON>, who worked closely with the reclusive star and helped him write. `` He was someone we admired and thought was a real musical genius, and he had had a long and fascinating career, considering his age,'' <PERSON> Areheart </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I think the book reflects the <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> I've come to know. He's very sensitive, very loyal, very kind. `` He's every inch a professional; he's that way in every aspect of his life. He's very articulate, very intelligent, very creative, very lovely.'' <PERSON> Areheart </PERSON>, who has been a Doubleday editor for nine years, said both she and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were satisfied with the result. `` I did n't put any pressure on him about subjects he wanted to discuss in the book,'' she said. `` I wanted him to write a book that reflected things he wanted to share with people. I thought he was amazingly candid and warm and did an excellent job.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s honesty is illuminated in his feelings about his loneliness, his family, how his career was managed and his missed childhood. He started performing when he was 5 and recalled coming home from school, dropping his books, going to the studio, returning home around midnight and sometimes never even having time for a snack. There was a park across the street from the Motown studio, and he used to watch other youngsters at play. `` I'd just stare at them in wonder _ I could n't imagine such freedom, such a carefree life _ and wish more than anything that I had that kind of freedom, that I could walk away and be like them. So there were sad moments in my childhood,'' he said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is the seventh of nine children born to <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. He performed as lead singer with his older brothers as the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 5. They released 26 albums for Motown and Epic. Their father, a steel mill worker who played with a local rhythm and blues band, was extremely strict with the young performers. `` We'd perform for him and he'd critique us,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> writes. `` If you messed up, you got hit, sometimes with a belt, sometimes with a switch. ... Dad would make me so mad and hurt that I'd try to get back at him and get beaten all the more.'' When he turned 21, his father's management contract expired, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, dissatisfied with how his career was going, especially with Motown's refusal to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksons </ORGANIZATION> to write and produce, fired him.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Tuesday he did n't know until last week that the real estate family contributing money for his wife's salary was leasing office space to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In his first comments to reporters on the subject, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said `` there's absolutely no connection'' between his wife's $ 40,000-a-year salary donated to a charity by the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family foundation and a subsequent $ 50 million <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lease with a partnership headed by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also said that as attorney general he `` never participated in any matter pertaining to the Benders.'' After meeting with several Republican congressmen on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to discuss his trip earlier this month to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was asked whether it would have been better not to accept money that was coming from a family that was renting offices to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think at the time nobody knew that they -LRB- the Benders -RRB- were renting buildings to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' he replied. `` As a matter of fact, I did n't know that until I saw it in the news media last week.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported last Wednesday that a partnership headed by <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> won a $ 50 million lease renewal on a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> building housing offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency. Thirteen days after obtaining the new lease, real estate developer <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> and his partners sold the building for $ 22.6 million more than they had paid for it two years earlier, earning a 60 percent profit. `` Let me just say there's absolutely no connection between the two things -LRB- his wife's salary and the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>'s business with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and I think that will be made plain ultimately when all the facts are out,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. The attorney general was referring to the criminal investigation of his activities being conducted by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is looking into the involvement of longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> in <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> taking her position with the <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sclerosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, to which the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> contributed the money constituting her salary. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, has told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> played a `` peripheral'' role in Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> taking the job at the MS Society. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s ties to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement with scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> triggered <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s probe of the attorney general last May 11. Since then, the investigation has spread to Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s job and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s actions on behalf of a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project in which <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was acting as a lawyer for one of the partners. In addition, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> has been delving into <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ownership of $ 14,000 in regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone company stock during a time when as attorney general he was meeting with executives of the `` Baby Bell'' companies.

<HEAD>About 1,000 Cubans Move Step Closer To Deportation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 1,000 Cubans in federal custody have been determined a risk to the community by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, bringing them one step closer to deportation, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> will begin informing the prisoners this week that they are considered `` non-releasable,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Monday. The agency's action follows an agreement last year between the government and rioting Cuban prisoners in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, which called for a review of the cases of 3,800 Cubans in detention at the time. But in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, a lawyer who was present at the signing of the agreement complained that prisoners were not allowed to present evidence or witnesses during the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> review. `` It's a paper review. It's a joke,'' said <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Penalver </PERSON>. The prisoners also will not get hearings during the appeal process, he added. The prisoners, who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1980 boatlift from the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION>, had committed crimes in this country and served out their prison terms before the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> detained them indefinitely. In addition to the 1,000 judged non-releasable, about 2,100 of the detainees have been released or approved for release, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The rest still are being reviewed. Once they get their notices, the prisoners have 30 days to appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>. If that fails, they can appeal to a special <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> panel. Anyone failing both appeals can remain in detention indefinitely. But many of the non-releasable detainees also will receive deportation notices, said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON>. The deportation process includes two further chances at appeal. `` I think this is due process, and then some,'' <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> would not say when deportation notices would be sent, or how long the appeals could take. The prisoners rioted last fall, days after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced on Nov. 20 that an immigration pact with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had been renewed. Under the accord, up to 20,000 Cubans could come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year as immigrants and up to 3,000 more could arrive as refugees. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, in turn, agreed to take back at least 2,545 <ORGANIZATION> Mariel </ORGANIZATION> felons in INS custody. The news sparked riots at prisons in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. Many of the detainees had spent years in <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> detention and expected to be released under an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> review that started last June.

<HEAD>Head of Securities Group Concerned About Lack of Market
Cooperation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the securities industry's largest trade group told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that despite progress in some areas, he remains very concerned by lack of cooperation between stock and futures exchanges. `` My deep concern is that things are moving so slowly in coming up with the coordination between the various major markets,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week that they likely were within 30 days of reaching an agreement on coordinating market halts when stocks or stock futures rise or fall too sharply. But <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON>, who is chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Edward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> brokerage firm, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the pace of reform by the exchanges has been `` painfully slow.'' `` Exchanges, while they're quasi-public institutions, are still very much like businesses and competitive advantage is very important,'' he said. Thus, they are `` torn between loyalties'' when considering measures to prevent another stock market crash. <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON> said he finds market halts `` very distasteful,'' but the `` lesser of two evils'' when compared with `` the destruction of our markets.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Damgard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the trade group for futures brokers, said he favors `` natural trading halts'' such as price limits. However, stocks and futures industries remain split over the level of margins, the amount of money needed to control an investment. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is pushing for higher futures margins, while the futures exchanges say their margins, raised after the crash, are now high enough. <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON> advocated the creation of a new panel of senior exchange officials, which, under the oversight of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, would attempt to resolve such policy disagreements. <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON> opposed a proposal by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., that would create a supercommittee of federal regulatory agencies to decide policy conflicts by majority vote Instead, he backed the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s bid for authority over stock futures, which currently rests with the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Authority over futures margins should go to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which already sets stock margins, <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Damgard </PERSON> also opposed <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>'s proposal, which was introduced last month with the support of <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a Wall Street investment banker and former senator who headed a presidential task force that studied the crash. <PERSON> Damgard </PERSON> said it would be inappropriate for independent regulatory agencies to be forced to bend to the wishes of other regulatory agencies. He recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refrain from tinkering with the current division of regulatory turf but said more cooperation could be fostered by continuing a White House working group, which is planning to report its recommendations next month. <PERSON> Damgard </PERSON> said such a group would allow agencies to bring `` subtle pressures on one another without making one party knuckle under.'' He also said futures margins are best set by the individual exchanges. However, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> told <PERSON> Damgard </PERSON>: `` It seems to me what you're calling for is, if not chaotic, at least indecisive.

 <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> swore in its first new mayor in 28 years Tuesday as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> took over from the retiring <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> and pledged `` to shake things up a little.'' <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON>, who was elected April 5 by a comfortable margin, took the oath of office and replaced the longest serving big-city mayor in the country. `` After 28 years of leadership from Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> is prepared to build on his accomplishments _ and to improve upon them where we can,'' <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> said in his inaugural address at City Hall before about 200 city and state officials and supporters. <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>, 70, a past president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION>, announced last year he would not seek re-election because of his age. After <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> was sworn in, <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> wished his successor good luck. `` I know you have the courage and vision to do the job,'' <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON>, 38, whose campaign themes stressed the need for change, said he planned to seek broader cabinet-government powers. One proposal would allow the mayor to hire and fire certain city officials who now have set terms of office. <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> also immediately replaced five <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> appointees on the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sewerage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and called for the panel to fight water pollution. But one of <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON>'s biggest challenges will be grappling with lingering racial divisions in the inner city, where blacks suffer from high rates of unemployment and welfare. `` <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> has always been proud of its racial and ethnic diversity,'' he said. `` But not all racial and ethnic minorities have shared equally in our progress. `` City government can be and must be a leader in breaking down the barriers of discrimination and bringing this city together.'' <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> pledged to open city government to minorities, and of his 12 staff appointments, three are black and one is Hispanic. <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> also said creating jobs would be a top priority. `` All of the economic development tools and resources at our disposal will be targeted toward creating jobs and keeping them here in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Norquist </PERSON> said he planned to alter the structure of city government to cut expenses and hold down property taxes. `` I said many times during this campaign that <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> is at a crossroads,'' he said. `` Which path we take will determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> takes its place as one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s truly great cities in the 1990s, or whether it settles for second-class status.''

<HEAD>Persian Gulf Clash Largest Yet in U.S. Bid To End Tanker Attacks</HEAD>

 Monday's naval battle in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> marked the most heated conflict in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort aimed ostensibly at calming the `` tanker war'' between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention nearly a year ago came when many administration analysts believed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was in danger of losing the war it began with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980, a fear that has faded. The naval engagements on Monday coincided with claims by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that it had retaken the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, which it lost in 1986 in what many observers considered to be <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s major victory in the Iran-Iraq war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Tuesday denied it had lost <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION>, but noisily claimed that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters had flown air support for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops, allowing it to blame `` the Great Satan'' for what could prove to be a major Iranian defeat in the ground war. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> denied that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces flew in support of Iraqi troops. He and other administration officials portrayed the naval engagements on Monday as a kick in the teeth that they hoped would keep Iranian ships, speedboats and mines out of the gulf. In the wake of the fighting Monday, the two-man crew of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter was missing and an unknown number of Iranians were dead. That was thought to be the most casualties in the tanker war since an Iraqi warplane mistakenly fired on the USS Stark, killing 37 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors on May 17, 1987. Many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> expressed support for the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions. But the fighting renewed talk on Capitol Hill of invoking the War Powers Resolution, under which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have 60 days, or at most 90 days, to approve the deployment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in a war zone. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration fended off congressional efforts to invoke the War Powers resolution last year, but in doing so sent mixed signals about why it had agreed in the winter of 1986-87 to reflag 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers and provide them naval escorts in and out of the gulf. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., led criticism of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy last spring, saying `` we have basically taken a strong tilt toward <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> That ought to be debated on its own merit and not under the illusions that we are protecting the free flow of oil.'' Administration officials said the goal of the escorts was to protect the flow of oil out of the gulf, but also acknowledged they wanted to restore <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credibility among the Arabs following disclosures that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had sold arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. An Iranian victory in the war, they said, would endanger <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states along the gulf, a fear that was reinforced by riots by Iranians pilgrims to Mecca on July 31. And administration officials said they met the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> request for protection in order to prevent the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from providing the escorts and thereby increasing <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> influence in the region. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort soon became a contest of wills between the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the regime of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, and the Iranians appeared at times to have the upper hand. The escorts actually began last July 22, as four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships sailed with two U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers, the Gas Prince and the <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>. As the convoy neared an oil loading terminal in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a mine explosion rocked the <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, a 400,000-ton supertanker. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships crept the remainder of the way in the wake of the <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, which one <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer likened to a `` deep draft mine sweeper.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> called the debacle `` an irreparable blow to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military and political prestige,'' and said the mine had been laid by `` invisible hands.'' Although <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the most part avoided attacking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessels directly, its mines and speedboats continued to plague gulf shipping. Then, on Oct. 15, an Iranian Silkworm missile fired from <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> struck a U.S.-owned vessel, the <LOCATION> Sungari </LOCATION>, and the next day another Silkworm hit a reflagged <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> tanker, the <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, blinding its American captain, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>. On Oct. 19, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> struck back. Four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships fired 1,065 rounds from five-inch guns at an Iranian oil rig, destroying it. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, then still winning the ground war, refrained from a direct response. But over the winter, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> failed to launch its annual <LOCATION> Kerbala </LOCATION> offensive along the southern front, and there were reports that the <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> regime was having trouble finding `` martyrs'' to fill the ranks. Then <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> launched its surprise offensive to retake Faw. Confronted with defeat on land, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> responded with force to the new American attack on oil platforms in the gulf _ an attack very similar to the one <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> ignored last October. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vigilance had tightened since the attack on the Stark 11 months beforehand, and the apparent American military success seemed likely to fend off any moved in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recall the 25 to 30 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval vessels in and around the gulf.

<HEAD>Habitat To Build 20 Atlanta Homes In Largest Project To Date</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Habitat for Humanity announced Tuesday it will build 20 homes for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s working poor in a five-day crash project starting June 27, the 12-year-old volunteer agency's most ambitious project. The effort, named the <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> Work Project'88 after Habitat's best-known volunteer, is intended `` to fill a void between a market economy that does not reach down to some economic classes and a government with other spending priorities,'' said project director <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Habitat `` arouses the conscience of the world to the problem of the homeless'' and to the `` disgrace in our own rich nation of the homeless situation.'' The Americus-based Habitat has built more than 4,000 homes for the working poor on a non-profit, no-interest basis since 1976 and expects to complete 2,000 this year. It has chapters in 277 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities and 26 other countries. Recipients of the homes, who have to help build them, pay back the cost usually over 20 years with mortgages averaging $ 118 a month. The money goes into a revolving fund used to build more houses. Most of the labor is volunteer. The houses are wood-frame structures designed to be simple but adequate with all of the basics and few frills. Habitat has built 24 homes in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> since it started in the city in 1983 and hopes to complete 75 by 1990. City figures show 31 percent of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s housing to be substandard, compared with a nationwide average of 8 percent. `` Habitat is doing what the federal, state and local governments should be doing,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who also is active in the Habitat organization. `` Habitat is showing us the way.'' So far 10 families have been picked for the 20 homes to be built in the $ 600,000 project. The first house has already been built to serve as the temporary project office. After construction is over, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will move into the three-bedroom house with her two children. The <ORGANIZATION> Oglethorpe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> housekeeper has lived all her life in the down-at-the-edges southeast <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> neighborhood where the block of homes will be built. `` This means I can keep my roots here,'' she said. ` We helped frame it up and insulate it.'' `` There was a lot I did n't know and they showed me how,'' she said. `` Now if something goes wrong maybe I can fix it myself.'' Habitat also will build five row houses in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> starting June 20 and has announced a 12-week, 1,200-mile march from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> starting June 26 during which Habitat volunteers plan to build 120 homes and collect $ 1.2 million in donations to initiate more construction.

 A former English teacher is getting rave reviews for mathematics textbooks with odd titles like `` Mathematics Through Sports'' and `` Mathematics Through Home Management.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellyson </PERSON>, who also used to be a coach, has written four textbooks, and a fifth is on the way. So far, he has sold more than 1,600 books to a broad spectrum of educational institutions. The soon-to-be released `` Mathematics Through Sports'' reads like a series of short stories, interrupted with sets of math problems. `` People ask why something like this has never been done before,'' said <PERSON> Ellyson </PERSON>. `` I tell them, ` Because it's a heck of a lot of work.''' <PERSON> Ellyson </PERSON>, 70, retired eight years ago from his post as superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Weed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, about 240 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and began writing. `` I figured if students saws the relevancy in the math, how it is meaningful in their lives, they'd enjoy school and stay in school,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had a good year last year, so good it decided to do a good turn for its workers _ and an electronics company.

<HEAD>Protesters Take Over Tribal Headquarters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Thirty protesters from the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tribe </LOCATION> occupied the lobby of tribal headquarters for a second day Tuesday to protest a hunting and fishing rights agreement between the tribe and the state. Protesters said they would stay until elected tribal officials meet with them. They brought food, blankets and a television set into the building, which also houses the local office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. The protesters were not barring entry to the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> offices. Tribal officials have told the protesters they would have to wait until a regular tribal committee meeting April 28 in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION> to talk with tribal leaders. On Monday, tribal officials threatened to call police if the protesters remained in the headquarters building after the 5 p.m. closing time. But Cass County Sheriff <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowson </PERSON> said Monday night, `` they have n't called and I'm not going to do anything about it unless they're harming people.'' No problems have been reported. The protesters have said their leaders reached agreement with the state on hunting and fishing rights in northeastern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> without consulting the members. They also said the agreement, approved by <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and signed by Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> last week, gives away their hunting and fishing rights for a fraction of their worth. The agreement, the protesters argue, violates federal law by interfering with the Treaty of 1854 between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Anishinabe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>, whose anglicized name is <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION>. The agreement requires the Fond du Lac, <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> bands to abstain from exercising full hunting, fishing and gathering rights reserved under the 1854 treaty. In exchange, the three bands would received $ 5 million annually. The agreement does not affect hunting and fishing on reservations, but requires Indians to give up their rights under the treaty to hunt and fish free of state restrictions on non-reservation land. The area involved covers about 10,000 square miles among the three tribes and reaches roughly from the <LOCATION> Snake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, north to the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> border near the mouth of the <LOCATION> Vermillion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and east to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> needs to improve its compliance with a law designed to eliminate conflict of interest questions about <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> advisers, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The Pentagon `` is generally complying with'' the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Act </ORGANIZATION>, but `` some key steps still have not been implemented and should be,'' said <PERSON> Rosslyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleeman </PERSON> of the congressional watchdog agency. The testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> centered on expert panels created to advise the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, the office created in 1983 to oversee President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars anti-missile program. The <ORGANIZATION> SDIO </ORGANIZATION> was chosen for a review because it uses a large number of expert committees. Throughout the government, there are more than 1,000 advisory committees on a wide range of topics. Five years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> was sharply criticized for lax management of conflict-of-interest and ethical questions and the <ORGANIZATION> SDIO </ORGANIZATION> advisory committees were created after that review. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is doing a better job, it's still not good enough, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said `` Specifically, the advisory committees need to document the reasons why individuals were selected for advisory committees and panels in order to demonstrate how they went about achieving the balanced membership required in the act,'' <PERSON> Kleeman </PERSON> said. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study said the committees need better documentation of financial disclosure statements made by panel members, and need a better review process to make sure ethical questions are answered. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, chairman of the panel, said the Pentagon has taken steps to improve its oversight of the committees. But he added that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s `` compliance ... remains open to question'' with a requirement for documenting why people are picked. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for administration, testified that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has tried to improve its oversight of the panels. `` Problems regarding the administration of DoD advisory committees sometimes surface,'' he said. `` When they do, we address them promptly.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> SDIO </ORGANIZATION>, admitted that his office had found `` a weakness in our internal management controls'' which delayed appointments of consultants. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnas </PERSON>, a computer scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, testified that three years ago he was offered $ 1,000 per day to serve on a panel advising the SDIO on computer software.

 A death camp survivor said Tuesday that the conviction of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> for <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war crimes avenged millions of Jews killed in the Holocaust, but <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s family contended he was the victim of biased judges. `` This verdict is revenge for all those who did not survive,'' a jubilant <PERSON> Pinchas </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> had testified during the 14-month trial that he recognized the retired <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> autoworker as `` Ivan the Terrible,'' the nickname used by prisoners at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp for one of their guards. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, condemned the verdict as `` ludicrously sweeping'' and said it resulted from `` judges who lost their impartiality.'' `` Five, 10, 15 years from now, when people look back at this trial, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is going to be remembered as the victim,'' his son said. Israeli officials applauded the conviction Tuesday, and Justice Minister <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharir </PERSON> called for the death penalty. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is to be sentenced next Monday. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, of suburban <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, was convicted of operating gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1942 and 1943. In a 450-page decision, the judges rejected all defense arguments. The Ukrainian-born <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, 68, has maintained he is a victim of mistaken identity who was a Nazi prisoner of war and was not at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, one of five survivors who identified <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> as `` Ivan the Terrible,'' left the courtroom in tears Monday when judges described atrocities committed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> guard. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s prime minister, <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, praised the trial and conviction. `` Every Jew feels a certain degree of satisfaction from the conviction of <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>,'' the Polish-born <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. His parents were killed in the Holocaust. Speaking from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, Justice Minister <PERSON> Sharir </PERSON> called for <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> to be sentenced to death. `` A man convicted of such terrible crimes deserves no other sentence,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. However, he has no authority over the state prosecutor, who will argue the sentence at Monday's hearing. In a rare public comment, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, who also lost family in the Holocaust, lauded the legal proceedings. `` It was a just trial,'' Begin, who has lived in seclusion for the past five years, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` Thanks to the trial, the younger Israeli generation learned about the fate of the Jews in the Holocaust.'' About 6 million Jews were put to death in the Holocaust. <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Terlow </PERSON>, who helped prosecute <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, the only other man tried in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war crimes, said he was certain the judges would not have convicted <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> if there were doubts about his identity. `` No stone was left unturned, there was a mountain of evidence,'' <PERSON> Terlow </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, the architect of the Holocaust, was convicted and hanged in 1962. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son-in-law, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>, said the judges automatically rejected defense arguments. `` It was as though the judges were sitting there with their ears covered and their eyes closed during the defense side of the case,'' he said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said: `` Judging by the way they conducted the trial and totally disregarded our evidence in their verdict, we do n't expect anything less than the death penalty.'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, said although he had expected a guilty verdict at the emotionally charged trial, `` It totally surprised me that they -LRB- the judges -RRB- could be so devastatingly sweeping.'' <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said he would argue against the death penalty on Monday and planned to appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. There is no minimum sentence but <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is considered unlikely to receive anything short of life imprisonment.

 Financial prospects for American farmers continue to brighten, and one reason is a pickup in grain exports this year, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said Tuesday. Large purchases by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, particularly wheat sold at subsidized prices, have played an important role. Overall, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s total grain imports are at a three-year high, despite bumper harvests the last two seasons, the report said. `` The gain is primarily from larger wheat purchases,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Aided by the Export Enhancement Program and Soviet demand for milling-quality wheat, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of import volume is likely to rise to about half this year, up from less than 1 percent in 1985-86.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is expected to import 32 million metric tons of grain from all foreign sources in the international marketing year that runs through June 30, 1988. That would be the most since imports were a record 55.5 million tons in 1984-85. The wheat share of this year's imports is estimated at 22 million tons, the most since 1984-85 when wheat rose to 28.1 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. Soviet wheat imports dropped sharply in 1985-86 to 15.7 million tons, when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share declined to a trickle. Under a five-year agreement, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is committed to buy at least 4 million tons of wheat and 4 million tons of corn annually. The pact expires Sept. 30 and covers the year that began last Oct. 1. Although the agreement year is three months out of step with the July 1-June 30 marketing year, it does show a similar trend in Soviet grain imports. For example, Soviet wheat purchases fell short of the pact's minimum in 1984-85 when they dropped to 2.9 million tons, and in 1985-86 when they were only 200,000 tons That coincided with the `` less than 1 percent'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share cited in the latest report. The Export Enhancement Progam allows exporters to sell designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices and then collect free USDA-owned commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. Subsidized wheat sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began a year ago. So far <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has bought more than 8.8 million tons for delivery in 1987-88, the final year of the grain pact. In addition, the Soviets have bought 4.1 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, 818,400 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal for delivery through Sept. 30.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> admnistration, supporting sweeping legal immunity for the government, urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to kill a lawsuit in behalf of a boy who contracted polio after receiving a dose of federally approved vaccine. Some justices reacted skeptically to arguments by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>, who said the government should be shielded from paying damages. `` If you win, you might as well repeal the -LRB- Federal -RRB- Tort Claims Act,'' Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> told <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>. The act permits the government to be sued in limited instances when officials negligently cause personal injuries. The law does not surrender government immunity for injuries resulting from an official's `` discretionary function or duty.'' <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> urged the court to protect the government from suit `` even if a specific -LRB- federal -RRB- employee is negligent'' _ and is not exercising discretion. The court is expected to announce by July whether it will revive a suit in behalf of polio victim <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkovitz </PERSON>, who was less than three months old on May 10, 1979 when his pediatrician in <LOCATION> Charleroi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, gave him a dose of <LOCATION> Orimune </LOCATION>. The drug, manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, is a form of <PERSON> Sabin </PERSON> oral vaccine. <PERSON> Orimune </PERSON> was licensed by the government in 1963. <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> was stricken with polio within a month and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Communicable Disease Center determined he contracted the disease from the vaccine. He is paralyzed and deformed and breathes with the help of a respirator. Ms. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Viakley </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the <PERSON> Berkovitz </PERSON> family, urged the court Tuesday to revive the suit to allow the family to prove that it may have been `` pure, sheer negligence'' by government workers that caused the child's polio. She alleged that in licensing the vaccine, federal workers approved it even though the number and size of lesions it caused exceeded the government's standards. It was not a discretionary decision by the government that the defective vaccine was safe, she said. `` The allegation is that the numbers -LRB- of lesions -RRB- did n't add up,'' Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> later said to <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>, the government lawyer. He did not dispute that interpretation. But <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> said even when an employee is negligent, the government agency he works for may be using its discretion in approving the vaccine. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> threw out the <PERSON> Berkovitz </PERSON>'s suit last year The appeals court said the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is exempt from the suit because the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> exercised policy-making authority _ in effect, its own discretion _ when it initially decided to verify test results by vaccine manufacturers. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision on how to go about testing the safety of polio vaccine is a discretionary act that immunizes the government from suit, the appeals court said. The administration has argued that if the government can be sued in such cases, it will be forced into becoming an insurer of vaccines and may withdraw from licensing them. Federal officials said <PERSON> Sabin </PERSON> oral vaccine, administered routinely to all children in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has all but eliminated polio even though each year a few who take the vaccine have adverse reactions. The case is <PERSON> Berkovitz </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-498.

 More than 150,000 refugees fleeing a guerrilla war and drought in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> are likely to arrive in neighboring <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> over the next nine months, adding enormous strains to an already-taxed relief effort, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> currently provides haven for 450,000 Mozambican refugees, but `` the population in <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> is rapidly increasing and the most conservative estimates forecast 600,000 refugees will arrive by December 1988,'' according to a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. The report said other African countries also are receiving large numbers of refugees. There are 75,000 in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, 30,000 in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, 225,000 in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, 72,000 in <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and 20,000 in <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>. Within <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, there are 1.6 million displaced people, the department said. `` Complicating the refugee situation is that <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> has also experienced a drought and a mealy bug infestation,'' the department said. `` More than one million Malawians no longer have the resources to feed themselves.'' A consultant hired by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to assess the magnitude of the problem and recommend <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> responses said he interviewed a selected, geographically diverse sample of 200 refugees in camps between January and March. The consultant, at a background briefing arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION>, said 91 percent of those he interviewed reported they <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> because of fighting between <LOCATION> RENAMO </LOCATION>, a potent guerrilla movement, and the <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> government. The war has been going on since the mid-1970s. `` It reflects an intensity in the level of violence over the period of the last year,'' the expert said. `` I think the drought is an aggravating factor in increasing the refugee flows, but according to the refugees with whom I spoke, the great majority fled because of <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION> related violence.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has pledged $ 4.4 million to a <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> special appeal for Mozambican refugees in <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. This is in addition to $ 33.4 million contributed to the <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION>'s program covering all of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 More than 2,400 photographs from the assassination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> were unaccountably destroyed nearly 20 years ago, officials said Tuesday as they opened to the public for the first time the long-secret police files. There was no explanation in the 50,000 pages of documents why the pictures were burned or why such items as ceiling tiles and door jambs from the scene of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s death were destroyed in the months following the assassination. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Secretary of State March <PERSON> Fong </PERSON> <PERSON> Eu </PERSON> released the documents, including interviews with 4,000 witnesses and 2,500 photographs from the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> files. The state's chief archivist said the documents were unlikely to answer the numerous questions surrounding the 1968 assassination because of the destroyed material. `` I've never seen a file quite this large,'' said archivist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. `` This is a very unusual murder file -LRB- but -RRB- I'm not absolutely satisfied that any questions are answered.'' He said the biggest surprise was the amount of evidence destroyed, including the photographs, which were burned three months after the assassintation. Their subjects are unknown. `` What I did n't know, and I'm told others did n't know, was that so much evidence was destroyed,'' he said. He also said he could not explain why evidence was destroyed, noting police were careful at the outset because they did n't want `` another <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' where <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s brother, President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, was killed. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said he had not had time to examine all the evidence, which he predicted will occupy researchers for years. The gaps in the material drew immediate criticism. `` Someone should ask the police why they destroyed 2,400 photographs in the most important case they've ever examined. ... We did n't know about that until today,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> and a longtime student of the case. Among the persistent questions raised by conspiracy theorists and scholars are: Was <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishara </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> the only gunman? Was <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> shot from in front or behind? Were there eight shots or more in the pantry of the Ambassador Hotel? And how close was the gunman whose bullet entered <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s brain? Among the material put on display Tuesday was a polka dot dress, bullets taken from victims and <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>'s diary entry saying `` RFK must die.'' The dress was one of many purchased by police in an effort to jog the memories of witnesses on a point of contention _ that a girl in a polka dot dress seen running from the Ambassador Hotel shouting `` We shot him.'' That report was never verified. The documents released include an admission by police that they destroyed key evidence, including ceiling tiles, a door jamb and thousands of photographs taken in the Ambassador Hotel kitchen where <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was shot on June 5, 1968. An official record in the evidence showed that 2,410 photographs were burned on Aug. 21, 1968. It gives no reason. Also released was the police tape recording of a call reporting the shooting. The caller did not immediately know who was shot but told the officer who answered that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was in the hotel, to which the unidentified officer replied: `` Big deal.'' When told seconds later that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had been shot, the unidentified officer asked for the address of one of the biggest hotels in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Extensive videotape and audio recordings graphically depict the confusion at the scene. The videotape shows a fatally wounded <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who moments before had declared victory in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Democratic presidential primary, lying on the floor, while witnesses and other victims appear dazed The shooting shooting occurred prior to Secret Service protection for presidential candidates. One entire case of evidence contained items from Sirhan's <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> home, including the diary in which <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> scrawled in pencil his plans to kill the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> senator `` My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more the more of an unshakeable obsession,'' he wrote. `` RFK must die.'' On the eve of the release of the files, <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> McKissack </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> expects nothing to contradict his frequently stated claim that he was a lone gunman. Witnesses told of seeing <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> step from behind a steam table into <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s path as the senator walked toward him. But <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Noguchi </PERSON> testified at <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>'s 1969 trial that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was killed by a shot fired behind his right ear. Conspiracy theorists suggested that a second gunman fired at Kennedy from behind while <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> stood in front. <PERSON> McKissack </PERSON> said that although <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> maintains he does n't remember shooting <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, a Jordanian immigrant, believes he was motivated by anger over the Arab loss in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war He blames his memory loss on alcohol. <PERSON> McKissack </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, serving his life sentence at <LOCATION> Soledad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, has given up hope he will ever be paroled. The release of the records follows years of demands for public access to the information. The only things withheld from disclosure, <LOCATION> Eu </LOCATION> said, were autopsy photos, criminal `` rap sheets'' and fingerprint cards, juvenile case records, internal police personnel records and records that originated with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> or police departments outside <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would release its own file at an unspecified time.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> deported eight more Palestinians from the occupied lands to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Tuesday, including six involved in a stoning attack on teen-age <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> hikers in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village, the army said. In other developments, <PERSON> Ezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>, a Cabinet minister without portfolio, said the assassination of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> last week may lead to more terrorism. The army censored a newspaper editorial criticizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s reported role in the killing. Army officials said for the first time that the April 6 attack on the hikers was planned. A teen-aged Jewish settler and two Palestinians were killed. The officials said the planning was done by some of those in the group of deportees, and described them as members of an outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> youth group. An army spokesman said soldiers set up roadblocks to stop <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> residents of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for two days beginning Tuesday night. He said the measure was aimed at preventing terror attacks on Memorial Day, which began after nightfall Tuesday, and Independence Day, which begins Wednesday night and marks the 40th anniversary of the nation's birth. A Palestinian died Tuesday of wounds suffered the day before in a clash with soldiers in the <LOCATION> Pekoah </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village, an army spokesman said. At least 168 Palestinians have been reported killed since riots began Dec. 8 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied since capturing them from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and civilian also have been slain. Curfews continued on 17 refugee camps and towns in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and seven of eight refugee camps in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Major cities also remained off limits to non-residents, including journalists. Hospital officials said a 16-year-old Palestinian was wounded during clashes in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The army reported relative calm elsewhere. `` There is no doubt that the number of disturbances has declined in the past three days,'' said an army spokeswoman, who attributed it to the clampdown. Three Arabs have been killed since Saturday, when 15 died in riots that began with the news that <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> had been killed in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. Tuesday's deportations brought to 20 the number expelled since the rebellion began. Six were from <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, where residents stoned 16 teen-age Jewish hikers from a nearby settlement and their two armed guards. A 15-year-old Israeli girl, <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, and two <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> residents were killed in the clash. An army report said Ms. <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was killed by a bullet fired from the weapon of one of the Israeli guards. Initial reports said she had been stoned to death by Palestinians. Col. <PERSON> Raanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, deputy army spokesman, said one deportee, <PERSON> Njjah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Saada </PERSON> <PERSON> Daweikat </PERSON>, led the hikers into the village. Previous reports said they followed after receiving promises of protection. <PERSON> Daweikat </PERSON> admitted inciting another villager to attack an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> youth, <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said. He added that another deportee, <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani-Shamseh </PERSON>, took the gun away from one of the Israeli guards and did not surrender it until he was arrested several days later. A military official who demanded anonymity said the six <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> deportees were organizers in <LOCATION> Shabibeh </LOCATION>, an outlawed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> youth group. For more than a month, he claimed, the group had run <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> after declaring it a `` liberated village.'' `` They had planned an attack on hikers in advance. When this group came from -LRB- the Jewish settlement of -RRB- <PERSON> Elon </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreh </PERSON>, the opportunity presented itself. They had planned to take a group into the village and hold them hostage,'' he said. The army bulldozed 14 houses of those who allegedly took part in the stoning. One resident later was found to have tried to help the settlers and the army promised compensation. According to the military official, those deported were planners of attacks on civilians, not stone-throwers. `` They had planned it beforehand,'' he said. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, editor of the pro-PLO daily <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fajr </ORGANIZATION>, predicted expulsion would `` inflame the situation and actually add to the determination of the Palestinian people in their struggle for their national aspirations.'' <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, said it had been proven that Ms. <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> died from a bullet fired by a Jewish guard and the deportees were `` innocent victims of provocation by the Jewish settlers.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has condemned deportations, saying international law bans transfer across borders of civilians living in occupied zones. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> criticized the latest expulsions. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> says only mass deportations are illegal. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources say Israeli commandos shot and killed <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON> at his home, but the nation's leaders have been silent on the subject. <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> reported the attack was approved at a Cabinet meeting last week, with dissenting votes cast by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>, a former defense minister. <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON> declined to say if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was responsible but told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> the killing would lead to more terrorism. `` It distances the peace process and will bring greater hostility and make us more vulnerable around the world.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military censor took the unusual step of censoring an entire editorial in the Yediot Ahronot daily. Newspaper sources said the editorial dealt with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s role in <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>'s killing.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s highest-paid executive in 1986, earned nearly $ 18 million last year in salary, cash and stock bonuses and options, the automaker reported Tuesday <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s earnings were part of the $ 85.2 million in compensation that executives of the No. 3 automaker took home last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> released the figures the day after it opened early contract talks with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, and union Vice President <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> blasted the earnings as `` an incredible rip-off.'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>, who leads union negotiators in the talks, said in a statement with <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> that the executives' earnings `` blatantly contradict the message they try to send <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> members in their factories and offices. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s 1987 earnings of $ 17.9 million included nearly $ 13.5 million from exercising stock purchase options granted earlier in the decade, when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> was recovering from near ruin and its stock was worth a fraction of its present value. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> also received $ 765,890 in salary, $ 725,000 in cash bonuses, $ 249,000 in stock bonuses and a stock grant worth nearly $ 2.7 million when it was issued Dec. 8. The figures were contained in <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s proxy statement, mailed Tuesday to shareholders. In 1986, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> took home $ 20.6 million, including $ 9.3 million on exercised stock options. Proxy statements released and compiled later in the year showed he was the nation's highest-paid executive. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 executive, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>, received nearly $ 6.6 million in 1987, including $ 560,000 in salary and nearly $ 5.3 million from exercising stock options. <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the company's automaking subsidiary. In all, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> paid out $ 85.2 million to 2,035 executives in 1987: $ 77.9 million in cash, more than $ 1 million in stock bonuses and nearly $ 6.3 million in retirement bonuses, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiniven </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Vice Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> was the No 2 earner among Big Three auto executives, receiving nearly $ 11 million: $ 808,697 in salary, $ 2 million in cash bonuses and $ 8.1 million earned exercising stock options. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, topped <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s earners last year with $ 2.2 million, including $ 867,000 in salary, an estimated $ 800,000 in stock bonuses, $ 513,000 in stock options and $ 56,000 from a savings plan Executive earnings at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> were disclosed last week. In their statement, Steep and <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said the automakers pressure workers to reduce costs to match Japanese auto companies, but then justify `` stratospheric'' compensation for its executives. The union said top officers in Japanese companies earn about six to eight times what their factory workers make. American executives receive salaries that are 12 to 18 times their workers' pay, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> said, and total earnings are hundreds of times what workers receive when stock and cash bonuses are included. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 1.29 billion, down 7.2 percent from 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings rose 40 percent last year to an industry-record $ 4.6 billion. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest automaker, earned $ 3.6 billion in 1987, up 22 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers have no profit-sharing plan but are due to receive one under their next contract, which will adopt a formula established at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> last year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> paid no profit-sharing for 1987 because it earned too little on its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto operations to trigger payments. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> eliminated its executive cash bonus plan in 1987 but gave out $ 184.6 million in executive stock bonuses last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> paid out a record $ 636 million in profit-sharing for 1987, averaging $ 4,000 per worker. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also paid out a total of $ 247.9 million in 1987 cash bonuses to 5,166 executives.

 Israeli leaders privately expressed concern about <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s rising popularity, but avoided saying publicly whom they want to see in the White House next year to avoid embarrassment after November elections. Political observers said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s favorite is Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would likely be best because he is a known quantity,'' said political scientist <PERSON> Rafaela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilsky </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, adding that Democratic presidential hopeful <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` is an unknown.'' She said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders were not expected to voice their preference. `` It's a matter of political wisdom, etiquette. If we say who we'd like, then what happens if the other guy is elected?'' she said. In a recent interview, right-wing Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> refused to state his preference in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential race. All candidates have stated views on the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict that conflict with the position of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who opposes territorial compromise with the Arabs. Asked about the views of the presidential contenders, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said: `` I would prefer to discuss this with the people in the government.'' He declined to elaborate. Some <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> associates, however, broke with tradition and expressed apprehension about prospects that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would run on the Democratic ticket. `` We have fears because Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has said some very tough things about Jews and voiced sympathy for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' legislator <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Doron </PERSON> of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc said in a telephone interview Ms. <PERSON> Doron </PERSON> refused to say which candidate she favored. `` We prefer to refrain from interfering in the American elections, just the same as I would expect any other country to refrain from interfering in our politics,'' she said. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> public has shown great interest in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign and the local media have covered it extensively. Most commentaries focused on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s popularity, debating what it means to the Jewish state. The mass-circulation Maariv daily called on American Jews to vote against the Democrats if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was on the ticket. `` He has publicly embraced -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. In many years there has not been such a prominent political leader in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who has shown such hostility toward Jews in general and particularly toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' the newspaper said in a recent editorial. `` We hope that American Jews will draw the proper conclusions about the party in which <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> plays a key role.'' An opinion column in the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> daily, however, urged <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders to accept <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s status and open a dialogue with him `` because he is one of the most influential leaders in the.. <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' Most commentators agree the outcome of the November elections will have little influence on U.S.-Israeli ties. `` It will only be a matter of whether things will be harder or easier,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bilsky </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Shenandoah Council Votes To Declare Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHENANDOAH, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This former coal-mining community has taken the extraordinary step of filing for bankruptcy to get out from under a $ 450,000 debt. While a standing-room-only crowd watched, the borough council voted 5-2 Monday to file under Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy law, which allows the community to hold off its creditors while it works out a plan to pay its debts. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubroff </PERSON>, a lawyer handling the bankruptcy filing, said that the municipality is not the first in the nation to seek Chapter 9 protection but that the tactic is rare. Council President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Slezosky </PERSON> said the community of about 7,000 residents, more than 60 percent of them retired or on fixed incomes, can not dig itself out of debt without help. He blamed the borough's debts on the previous administration's `` sloppy'' business practices and unwillingness to raise taxes or cut services while costs rose Councilmen <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Litwak </PERSON> voted against the move. `` I do n't relish bankruptcy,'' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. He said the initial cost of filing is $ 25,000 and the lawyer's fee $ 195 an hour. `` We're not gaining anything. All we are doing is taking taxpayers' money and giving it to lawyers.'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said he would prefer that the borough borrow $ 425,000 to pay off its bills and then adopt some belt-tightening measures. But <PERSON> Slezosky </PERSON> said that require the borough to raise its real estate tax 60 percent. `` One of the easiest things we could have done, and we could have done it two months ago, was to borrow $ 425,000, but not come out of this for 10 years,'' <PERSON> Slezosky </PERSON> said. A declaration of bankruptcy, if aproved by a federal bankruptcy judge, would prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> from adding fines and penalties to the $ 122,000 the borough owes in taxes withheld from employees' paychecks. <PERSON> Slezosky </PERSON> said some of the paperwork for the reorganization plan, such as a five-year tentative budget, already has been prepared. Representatives of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> said last week that filing for bankruptcy automatically will place the borough under the agency's distressed communities program. <PERSON> Slezosky </PERSON> said he hopes the bankruptcy action will qualify the borough for state grants and no-interest loans available under that program. The <ORGANIZATION> DCA </ORGANIZATION> is expected to place some restrictions on how the borough spends money and levies taxes until its financial difficulties are resolved, <PERSON> Slezosky </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> DCA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddig </PERSON> said the agency would ask borough officials to reconsider a bankruptcy filing until all avenues are exhausted through the state's programs. He said a bankruptcy filing would be the first his agency is aware of by a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> municipality. Borough records showed only a $ 69,000 debt, but an independent audit ordered in January by the council's new Republican majority uncovered almost $ 400,000 in unpaid bills from the past administration, <PERSON> Slezosky </PERSON> said. A recent tax-anticipation loan received to pay current bills pushed the borough's total debt to about $ 450,000, <PERSON> Slezosky </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Colombia Threatened by `Human Rights Emergency,' Amnesty Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Embargoed For Release at 8:01 p.m. EDT _ Time Set By Source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s armed forces have placed the country in a `` human rights emergency'' by extending repression to include not just leftists but anyone who does not support the military, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. A report by the London-based human rights group said <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has entered a new phase of political repression that threatens its social fabric. Murder is purportedly the main cause of death among men between the ages of 15-44, and many victims of political killings `` are tortured and then hideously disfigured both to prevent identification and to instill terror,'' according to the report. It states: `` A policy of terror and political murder by the Colombian armed forces, which has already resulted in thousands of killings and ` disappearances' in recent years, now threatens the civic, cultural and academic lifeblood of the country. `` Political repression in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has entered a new phase and the country is in the grip of a human rights emergency.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said the new phase began last July with the publication of `` hit lists'' of prominent Colombians and a wave of killings of students, university lecturers and human rights leaders in the city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s second largest city, is the base for a drug cartel which is considered responsible for much of the cocaine shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Amnesty report asserts that large-scale human rights violations in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> stem from `` a deliberate policy of political murder'' by the armed forces. It said increased human rights violations `` have occurred in the context of renewed guerrilla activity and pressure for social and political reform.'' But since mid-1987 `` the range of victims has extended far beyond left-wing opponents of the government. The people now singled out are not only those who criticize the goivernment or the armed forces, but also those who merely fail to support them.'' `` Whole sectors of society are at risk of being considered ` subversive,' and in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> that is tantamount to a death sentence,'' it adds. The report quoted Colombian human rights leaders as saying the government attributes the killings to uncontrollable civilian gunmen. `` But hundreds of case studies show that killings and ` disappearances' blamed on the ` death squads' were in fact carried out by police and military personnel and their civilian auxiliaries, acting on the authority of the army high command,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` Perhaps the most conclusive evidence that the ` death squads' are an integral part of the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> security forces is the simple fact that no one has been prosecuted and convicted for the thousands of political killings and ` disappearances' attributed to them,'' it said The report said most of the 500 political prisoners freed under amnesty decrees in 1982 have been killed or exiled or have disappeared. Last year, 15 members of a Colombian human rights organization received death threats, four were killed, one disappeared and five fled the country, the report said. It quoted <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s national teachers union as saying more than 300 members received death threats in 1987 and 15 were slain. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said the government is responsible for human rights and it must bring the security forces under control.

<TEXT>
 About 10,000 people held anti-government street demonstrations Tuesday to mark a student uprising that ousted <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s first government 28 years ago. National police reported `` some arrests'' during clashes in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and elsewhere but would not give figures. There were no reports of injuries. Ferryboat crews in <LOCATION> Mokpo </LOCATION>, a major southwestern port, went on strike Tuesday, adding to a new wave of labor unrest. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials reported 363 labor disputes so far this year, of which 75 are unresolved. <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, gave the estimate of the number of demonstrators in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities Tuesday, the anniversary of a student march April 19, 1960, during which police shot down 125 people. The 1960 uprising spread through the country and President <PERSON> Syngman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhee </PERSON> resigned. In downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, about 3,000 students clashed with riot police sporadically until late at night, shouting `` Down with dictatorship!'' and `` Let's fight back, democracy!'' The protesters, most of them students, hurled rocks and firebombs at police, who responded with tear gas. About a dozen students set a police bus and passenger car ablaze by throwing firebombs into them near <LOCATION> Pagoda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. One young man shouted in front of the burning bus: `` We will never succumb to dictatorship! The April 19 student spirit is alive and will be kept alive forever!'' Riot police overpowered a group of students a block away and arrested seven or eight, and about a dozen protesters were taken away elsewhere in the capital, according to reports from witnesses. Thousands of plainclothes or riot police had moved into central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in anticipation of student protests, which have been a regular event on the anniversary. Street battles often interrupted traffic in the evening rush hour but passers-by appeared to pay little attention, except for using gauze masks against tear gas. Before the street protests, about 4,000 students and dissidents attended a memorial rally at a cemetery on <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s northern outskirts where nearly 200 people killed in 1960 are buried. Protesters announced formation of a new student-dissident alliance to campaign against the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the April 26 National Assembly elections.

<HEAD>Little Red Lighthouse Considered for Landmark Status</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A little red lighthouse brought to life in a 1942 children's story was proposed for landmark status Tuesday by a 9-year-old who clambered up to the microphone at a hearing to retell the tale of the proud beacon. Standing on a chair at the <ORGANIZATION> Landmarks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> hearing, <PERSON> Jonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> said that his father, City Comptroller <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON>, read him `` The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge'' when he was `` a little boy.'' `` I found it hard to imagine it really existed,'' <PERSON> Jonny </PERSON> said at the City Hall hearing. But his father later took him to see it on the bank of the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the shadow of the <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> in upper <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` We should make sure that it is always there for boys and girls to enjoy forever,'' <PERSON> Jonny </PERSON> said. Supporters of making the 67-year-old lighthouse known technically as <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON>'s Hook Light a landmark say the beacon recalls the age of mariners in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and has special significance to children of all ages. Once a structure is designated a landmark, changes in it require commission approval. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, commission chairman, said it could take several months to examine staff studies before deciding whether The Little Red Lighthouse should become a landmark. The children's story by <PERSON> Hildegarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lynd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> tells how the lighthouse coped with suddenly being overshadowed by the bridge. `` You know the story,'' <PERSON> Jonny </PERSON> told the commission. `` The lighthouse is proud of its job warning ships and tugboats and barges not to come too close to the rocky shore of the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.'' However, the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON> is built later, the story goes, and the beacon is in danger of being closed because the bridge has a warning light on one of its towers. `` At the end of the book, though, the lighthouse is still seen as necessary for safe navigation, and the bridge calls it ` Little Brother','' young <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> related. Real life was n't as kind to the lighthouse. Six years after the 1942 book was published, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> took the light out of service. Built in 1921, it was a replacement for a simple light pole with two 10-candlepower oil lanterns. The bridge opened in 1931. The lighthouse is a cylindrical steel and cast-iron structure, 40 feet high and 14 -LCB- - feet in diameter Resting on a concrete slab, it rises 61 feet above the water. The commission also is considering a proposal to make a 60-foot-high <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> neon sign on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> waterfront in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> a landmark. Built in 1936, it is considered by the commission staff to be an excellent example of neon display technology that began to transform outdoor advertising in the 1920s. Its designation as a landmark was opposed by <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Borough </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON>, who said it could delay development of a $ 155 million project for residential, commercial and recreational use of the area. Former Parks Commissioner <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, asked for a delay in any designation so the soft drink firm could study the proposal.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won its third television season in a row Tuesday and is already looking toward another win next season when its Summer Olympics coverage could give it a jump on the competition if the writers' strike continues. If the 6-week-old strike is n't settled soon, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> might not have new shows ready for air in September and could be forced to continue summer reruns _ and that could speed a continuing defection of viewers to cable and other alternatives <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, will start the season with the historically high-rated Olympics, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s Vice President for Research Projects <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said Tuesday that advertising interest in the Olympics is `` picking up.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> topped off the season by winning the final week, though the 60th Annual Academy Awards on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was the No. 1 show of the week, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> figures. For the week, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had an average rating of 13.9, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 13.5 and CBS 11.8. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million homes with television. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> ended the season with an average, prime-time rating of 16.0. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, which had been third for three years running, eked out second with a 13.7, thanks to the World Series, Super Bowl and Winter Olympics. CBS was third for the first time ever, with 13.5. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million households with televisions. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had never won a season before 1985-86. This was <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest win yet, and the biggest margin of victory for any network since <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> won in 1963-64 But Nielsen ratings showed the three-network average down 9 percent from last year. That figure was disputed by <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, who said his own comparison of more extensive local-market surveys showed a network decline of only 3 percent. He attributed the discrepancy to inaccuracies in <LOCATION> Nielsen </LOCATION>'s new people meter audience measurement system. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> released preliminary figures from a competing ratings company, <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION>, that showed CBS coming in slightly ahead of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> is still the ratings company used by advertisers to negotiate advertising rates, though. CBS has estimated that the lower people meter figures will cost the networks a combined $ 50 million in advertising revenues. The three networks have hired a consulting firm to scrutinize the new ratings system, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubens </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> vice president for research. The results are expected sometime this summer. Whether 9 percent or 3 percent, though, the networks are losing viewers to cable, independent stations and VCRs. <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said the decline is reversible if networks can put on enough popular shows like `` The Cosby Show,'' which increased total network viewing on Thursday night. `` The 3 percent is not immutable,'' <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said. `` There is no law of nature that says the networks will decline 3 percent every year, ad infinitum.'' `` The Cosby Show'' was the No. 1-rated show for the third year in a row, followed by its spinoff, `` A Different World,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers'' and `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Growing Pains,'' `` Who's the Boss <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Night Court,'' CBS' `` 60 Minutes'' and `` Murder, She Wrote,'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s new show, `` The Wonder Years.'' Of the two new shows that made the top 10, both were significantly helped by their popular lead-ins, `` A Different World'' by `` Cosby'' and `` Wonder Years'' by `` Who's the Boss?'' The only other new shows to make even the top 30 were <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` My Two Dads'' at 21st, `` In the Heat of the Night,'' at 19th, and `` Aaron's Way'' at 30th. The latter two premiered late in the season. Despite the lackluster performance by the new shows, <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> predicted a third of them will be renewed, following the pattern of previous years. The networks have parted company with big-event, multipart miniseries. Of 12 miniseries last year, all but two were two-parters. The top-rated `` Elvis and Me'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had rating of 24.5. `` The <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON> Story'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was the top-rated TV movie with 23.8. News ratings are measured quarterly, not by season, but beginning with the traditional television season in September when <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> converted to the people meters, `` NBC Nightly News'' dropped into a third-place slump. Last week, the `` CBS Evening News'' was No. 1 with a 10.1 and 21 share, narrowly edging <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' with 9.9 and 20 `` NBC Nightly News'' had an 8.7 and 18. The share is a percentage of sets in use.

<TEXT>
 Police have bought powerful motorcycles to battle a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> motorcycle gang called the Rockers that has caused accidents and disturbed residents of the capital, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. The official news agency said police purchased German-made BMW motorcycles that can travel up to 136 mph, but it did not say how many. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Rockers will not be able to escape police pursuers because their motorcycles are no match for the BMWs. It quoted <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurbatov </PERSON>, a captain of the police unit assigned to stop the gang, as saying his officers concentrate in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s `` hot spots'' where `` motorhooligans'' prowl the streets, with the noise of their machines awaking residents. `` The Rockers become active with the onset of warm days,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Beginning April 1, a day has n't gone by when because of them there has n't been a traffic accident with casualties. In these accidents not only the hotheads suffer but also passengers sitting behind their backs, as a rule minors who like to ride with the wind.''

<HEAD>Sudan Says It Will Not Allow Any Influx of Ethiopian Refugees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> was `` saturated'' with refugees and he would not accept the expected influx of hundreds of thousands of people fleeing from neighboring <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. Western relief officials expressed fear there could be heavy loss of life among <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s refugees. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said he discussed the situation with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s Marxist government and with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> of High Commissioner for Refugees and other relief organizations. He said the talks were aimed at organizing aid shipments to the affected people in the Tigre and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> regions in northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, or at setting up camps inside <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> near the border with <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Secessionist warfare in the two regions complicates delivery of relief to millions of people suffering because of famine and drought. In a 30-minute interview at his <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> headquarters, the prime minister told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` We think that <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> has been saturated and we can not take any more refugees.'' He said he made that known last October. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency estimates there are around 900,000 refugees in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> including 677,000 Ethiopians. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> puts the figure at close to 2 million. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> was elected prime minister in April 1986, a year after a military coup overthrew President <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>. Western relief officials here, speaking on condition of anonymity, say from 2 million to 3 million Ethiopians in Tigre and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> will be affected by an expected Ethiopian government offensive against rebels. The officials expect refugees by the hundreds of thousands to move toward eastern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> within the next month. They said there is no stockpile of relief food in the drought-affected areas. The Ethiopian government recently banned relief organizations from working in the northern zones. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> suggested it can help relief agencies send food to Tigre and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> across the Sudanese border, or set up camps within <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> territory to receive refugees. One relief official said he feared that once the rainy season begins next month, it would be extremely difficult to move enough food aid to eastern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> to handle the expected influx, whether it was in Sudanese or Ethiopian territory. `` We will be hamstrung, and there could be large numbers of fatalities,'' the official said. Over the weekend, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> handed in his Cabinet's resignation to form a new coalition government representing a greater number of political parties. The five-man sovereign council, which acts in place of a president, accepted the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>'s resignation but kept <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> in power so he could form a new Cabinet. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said the new coaltion will include his centrist <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>; the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION>'s coaltion partner for the past two years; the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parties </ORGANIZATION>, and the small National Sudanese Party. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>, discussing <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s own war in the south, said he hoped improving relations with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> would gradually lead to an end of Ethiopian aid to the rebel group the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The rebels are asking for greater autonomy as well as economic and administrative reforms. In <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, the government said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> aid workers can resume drought relief operations in the war-torn north but more than 50 other Western workers remain barred from the region, an official there said Tuesday. The policy reversal affects only four of 60 Western relief workers. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> decision was `` a positive development. It's important, however, to permit a wide range of private voluntary organizations to work in the area if the needs of those at risk are to be met.

The storm also brought nearly a quarter inch of rain to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, which has had little more than traces of rain for most of the past 12 weeks. Water authorities said the rain would provide little relief from the region's drought. A winter storm warning continued through Tuesday night over parts of central and northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with two feet or more of new snow expected in higher elevations. Light snow also dusted the mountains of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Tuesday complained to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attacks in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> where the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyed or disabled two Iranian oil platforms and six naval vessels the day before. Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has the right to retaliate by any means available for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> `` acts of war'' and `` direct participation ... on behalf of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> defended its action as `` necessary and proportionate'' to the threat posed by Iranian actions. It told the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces `` exercised their inherent right of self-defense.'' A letter from <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON>, released Tuesday, said the American actions were against `` legitimate military targets'' and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not seek a military confrontation with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> foreign minister, made his complaint by letter. He asked Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to condemn `` this American act of aggression.'' `` It is also expected that immediate preventative measures are taken to stop the future recurrence of such crimes,'' said the letter, published Tuesday as a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> document. It said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` will under no circumstances surrender to the politics of force and manipulation and will certainly not leave this latest act of injustice unanswered.'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>'s letter cited the attacks on the oil platforms, which it called `` premeditated acts of aggression'' by the `` war-monger <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. administration.'' `` American attacks simply indicate a plan by both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to aggress against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to divert attention from the heinous war crimes of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, particularly the chemical bombing,'' the letter said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the platforms attacked as retaliation for a mine that damaged a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship last week and wounded 10 crew members. <PERSON> Okun </PERSON>'s letter said: `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces have exercised their inherent right of self-defense under international law by taking defensive action in response to an attack by the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> against a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval vessel in international waters. ... The actions taken are necessary and proportionate to the threat posed by such hostile Iranian actions.'' It referred to Iranian mine-laying and said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces `` attacked military targets which have been used for attacks against non-belligerent shipping in international waterways of the gulf.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said the platforms were used as bases for Iranian speedboats that attack neutral vessels. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> rejected the claim of self-defense and called the attacks on oil platforms `` nothing more than premeditated armed reprisal.'' He challenged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to produce evidence that the mines were laid by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and declared: `` There is no doubt that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and its agents have been mining the commercial lanes'' of the gulf.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> remembered its more than 16,000 war dead in Memorial Day ceremonies Tuesday and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the nation's enemies: `` All those who hurt us will be hurt manifold.'' Sirens sounded throughout the country Tuesday night, bringing activity to a standstill for one minute as Israelis remembered the soldiers killed in wars with their Arab neighbors. President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> ignited a memorial torch at the Western Wall, holiest site of Judaism, in a ceremony attended by relatives of fallen soldiers. `` The whole nation is aware of the heavy loss, the loss of life, the hopes that went up in the smoke of war,'' <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> said. `` We have to be aware that this is the price we pay for our freedom and our independence.'' Memorial Day ends Wednesday night with another torch-lighting ceremony at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Herzl </LOCATION> that starts the celebration of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 40th Independence Day Memorial Day always is the day before Independence Day. Israeli authorities increased security for the two holidays, fearing Palestinian attacks on Israeli targets in connection with the 4-month-old Arab uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Soldiers erected roadblocks in the occupied territories Tuesday night and officials said only Arabs with special permits would be allowed into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> until Independence Day celebrations end Thursday night. Police Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON> said extra police were posted throughout the country to prevent possible terror attacks and about 1,000 officers would patrol <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> until the Moslem sabbath ends Friday. `` There is information that terror organizations will try to carry out attacks. ... We ask the public to be alert and call police if they see a suspect object or irregular activity,'' <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> declared at a ceremony attended by hundreds of relatives of soldiers killed in battle: `` Let's hope that our enemies will realize and understand that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> knows how to wage war, and that all those who hurt us will be hurt manifold. `` There is no use and purpose in our enemies' repeated attempts to destroy us. When our enemies realize this and accept the existence of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, we will know that we have won life and peace because of our fallen soldiers.'' Army officials said 16,415 Israeli soldiers have been killed since independence in 1948, including 785 in the 1967 war, 2,679 in the 1973 war and 1,183 in the 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and three-year occupation. Most of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Jews have lost relatives in wars. The 700,000 Arab citizens do not serve in the army. Sirens are to sound again at 11 a.m. Wednesday for the start of memorial services at military cemeteries. Places of entertainment, including movie theaters and restaurants, were ordered closed for Memorial Day.

 A man died Tuesday of wounds suffered in a gang-related barrage of gunfire that killed his 6-year-old daughter in their home. Meanwhile, a 16-year-old girl was slain on a street corner in an apparent gang drive-by shooting Tuesday, authorities said. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Saucedo </PERSON>, 39, died at <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jr.-Drew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> two days after his daughter <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> was slain at their home in what her 13-year-old brother said was a grudge over a baseball cap of the wrong color. The Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> continued its search for two men who sprayed the home with bullets from a car Sunday night in <LOCATION> Compton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Saucedo </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 39, was in critical condition. The girl's brother and cousin were slightly injured. `` It started with this hat,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Saucedo </PERSON>, who suffered a minor stomach wound.

<TEXT>
 Tons of Soviet supplies including arms and ammunition are being flown into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> as Soviet troops prepare to withdraw, Western diplomatic sources said Tuesday. The diplomats, speaking in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity, said their contacts in the Afghan capital reported nightly arrivals of Soviet AN-12 and IL-76 transports at the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport the past week. They said the mood in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> generally was calm in the wake of the April 14 signing of an accord in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> for the withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet military personnel in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The sources reported East European diplomats were saying the Soviet troops probably would first pull back from the eastern area of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> when the withdrawal begins May 15. The Soviets sent troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the Marxist government fight anti-communist rebels. Although the Soviets are to withdraw under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement, the civil war is expected to continue. Rebel leaders said they would fight on and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> plans to continue providing aid to the rebels while the Soviets support government forces. The Western diplomats said some of the new Soviet supplies are beging moved south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in truck convoys, possibly for storage. There also have been reports of heavy fighting east and south of the capital. The sources said that on April 11, a Soviet convoy with more than 450 vehicles including tanks, mobile rocket launchers and other armored equipment headed for <LOCATION> Logar </LOCATION> province, immediately south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Guerrilla activity has intensified this spring in provinces bordering <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, according to various reports. The rebels usually launch operations as the winter snow melts, but guerrilla leaders vowed this year to step up the war because of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord that was framed without their participation. Prospects of a Soviet pullout have strengthened the Afghan currency to 167 Afghanis to the dollar compared to 210 in February, possibly in anticipation of a strong demand from returning refugees, the sources said. They also said the price of Russian vodka on the local market has doubled in recent weeks to the equivalent of $ 7.50 a bottle, with Soviet personnel apparently stocking up before returning home.

 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the next state in the Democratic presidential marathon, may well offer a smooth path for front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but for rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> the April 26 primary is strewn with obstacles. `` We could win the state and lose 80 percent of the delegates,'' lamented <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate coodinator <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobble </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s popular vote is merely a beauty contest and the real winner in the primary must succeed in direct delegate elections in the state's 23 congressional districts. A prize of 178 delegates, fourth largest of any state, is at stake. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s core support is concentrated in three districts in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, the state's two largest cities and home to most of the state's blacks. Blacks make up about 11 percent of the voting age population. Though turnout there may be the highest in the state and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could pull close to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the overall popular vote, the delegate races likely will swing overwhemlingly to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, observers say. `` These direct delegate elections are unfair to blacks. It's one of the last vestiges of Republican-type politics in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and it ought to be done away with,'' Cobble said. Personal popularity of the individual delegate candidates does n't count for much since the name of the presidential hopeful appears beside each committed delegate candidate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the only Democrat to field a complete slate of 116. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign, in contrast, has only 79 district delegate candidates and has turned to delegate-candidates pledged to former contender Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and other former candidates to fill out the gaps. The remaining 62 delegates will be apportioned in June according to the district outcomes. Some political veterans say <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could win no more than 30 delegates. `` Even in a best scenario how he -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- gets more than 30 delegates I do n't know,'' <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Millersville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. State Democratic Chairman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Yatch </PERSON>, who along with Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> is neutral in the race, does n't think <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s slate-filling effort will be fruitful But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign said late Tuesday afternoon it has commitments from eight to 10 delegates of departed candidates to support <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and is working on more. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will win <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, where he is endorsed by Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is favored everywhere else, <PERSON> Yatch </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON> and Erie Mayor <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tullio </PERSON> both have endorsed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The latest pre-primary poll, conducted Thursday through Sunday by the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a 59 percent to 20 percent edge over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> fell far back at 9 percent. The survey of 647 likely Democratic voters had a margin of error of 5 percent. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> is taking nothing for granted,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> He said a win could `` put <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> over the psychological top'' on the road to the nomination. A strong showing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would help <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is favored right now, delegate coordinator <PERSON> Cobble </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who won 16 percent of the vote and 18 delegates in the three-way 1984 presidential primary, hopes to woo disaffected blue collar workers, particularly in southwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where unemployment still runs into double digits in some areas. Statewide, he is hoping at least to duplicate his record of attracting 15 percent to 20 percent of the white vote. `` We'll do better than in 1984, exceed expectations and give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a hell of a run for his money,'' said <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON>, a national campaign aide. `` We're very competitive in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>.'' Democratic Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Singel </PERSON>, also neutral, disagreed. `` The more likely scenario is that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> uses <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to solidify his front-runnership, his hold on the nomination,'' <PERSON> Singel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s moderate stands should have meshed with <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s voters, who gave the state to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> both in 1980 and 1984 and who have n't elected a Democrat to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> since 1962 In fact, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was endorsed as the most electable of the candidates by the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has n't won anywhere since Super Tuesday in his native South and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary results could signal the end of his campaign. There is also a Republican race, at least on paper, but Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to easily brush aside his only remaining rival, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, in the contest for 78 delegates.

<HEAD>System Failure Was Worst Blackout in Quebec History</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Half a million customers in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> were without electricity for several hours Tuesday in the aftermath of the province's worst power blackout ever. Engineers at <ORGANIZATION> Hydro-Quebec </ORGANIZATION>, the provincially owned utility giant, struggled to explain the outage which began at 8:09 p.m. EDT Monday when ice knocked out a major transmission line from <LOCATION> Labrador </LOCATION>. The failure left at least 4 million customers in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> and scattered areas of northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> without electricity for up to seven hours. With three major power installations still off line Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Hydro-Quebec </ORGANIZATION> appealed to Quebecers to conserve electricity. Utility spokesman <PERSON> Jacques-Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Couture </PERSON> said a key question was why an automatic relay switch failed to work when the power lines from <LOCATION> Churchill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Labrador </LOCATION>, went down. The switch should have confined the outage to northern Quebec. Another mystery was why a power station at <LOCATION> Beauharnois </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> continued to feed power to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, instead of fulfilling its role as a backup power supply for the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> system. Couture said the blackout cost <ORGANIZATION> Hydro-Quebec </ORGANIZATION> $ 3 million -LRB- $ 2.4 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- in revenue. It was the tenth systemwide outage for <ORGANIZATION> Hydro-Quebec </ORGANIZATION> in 15 years. Officials conceded that neighboring <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> utilities have a better record. ` They are designing their system with criteria which are more severe than ours,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hydro-Quebec </ORGANIZATION> vice president. He said the company plans to spend $ 600 million -LRB- $ 486 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- to upgrade the Quebec grid. Quebec Energy Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Caccia </PERSON> said he is not worried that the incident will damage <ORGANIZATION> Hydro-Quebec </ORGANIZATION>'s growing export market in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I did n't get any phone calls from our <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> clients,'' he said. The initial outage stranded hundreds of passengers in the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> subway and in elevators. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> playoff game between the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadiens </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bruins </ORGANIZATION> was plunged into temporary darkness at the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION>, but resumed under emergency lighting. <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> won, 5-2.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he expects to face the winner of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democratic primary, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in the fall general election. `` It's a good bet, I think,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters traveling with him on Air Force II. He also defended supporter <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> mayor, and denied that <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON> could cost him the votes of blacks. `` I'm certainly not going to write off the ethnic community in this country because of a prejudiced view'' toward <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON>, he said. He said he had no hesitation to appear with <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON>. He noted that in his last unsuccessful campaign for mayor, <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON> had lost narowly. `` To have people suggest that I should not appear with him because I'm worried that will hurt me in some other area ... I reject it as invalid liberal trash.'' `` It's reverse discrimination,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters. On the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I do think that whoever wins -LRB- in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -RRB- will win the Democratic nomination.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did not intend to criticize <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> right away. `` I think I'll keep it generic until the convention,'' he said. However, he referred to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` an old-world liberal Democrat.'' Earlier, with <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON> at his side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a Republican rally in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>: `` I want to take on whichever one of those Democrats wins today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ and whip them in the fall.'' At stops earlier in the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated strong support for the American military strikes against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s forces. Speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said support for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military response `` has crossed partisan lines,'' both in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and `` around the world.'' `` I'm proud to have stood with the president and in support of the president,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In an interview with local reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` One has to keep one's options entirely open'' for possible future steps in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked whether arms the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration secretly sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an effort to free hostages had been used against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or its allies in recent days. Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has hinted that such arms were used. `` I'm not sure they've used them against us,'' he said. However, he added `` some of the weapons used in this exchange'' likely came from `` an inventory of weapons ... from a time when we were strongly in support of a much more moderate <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> than we have today.'' `` Back in the <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>'s -LRB- of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> -RRB- days, we had a very active program,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` There is a certain historical irony to it.'' On the day of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, where he was running virtually unopposed, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned across <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and said he does n't care which nominee Democrats choose. `` I ca n't wait for the fall, I ca n't wait for the debates with the Democratic nominee, no matter who he turns out to be. Even if they unleash <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, I ca n't wait,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a morning Republican fundraiser in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governer has said he would not accept a draft, even in the event of a brokered Democratic convention. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got a special tour of the Hershey chocolate factory and ate lunch in the plant cafeteria with workers. He was also presented with a two-foot chocolate seal of the vice president's office. `` Eat your heart out,'' he joked with reporters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had planned to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting on the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in early afternoon, but changed his plans and stayed in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> when the meeting was canceled. He also had evening events planned in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area. `` Things have quieted down,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>. `` He feels he's fully informed on what going on'' and does n't need to remain in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also reiterated his plans for establishing an ethics office in the White House if elected. `` I'm personally concerned with the breeches of ethics I've seen over the past years,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` When a congressman goes bad, or a member of the executive branch betrays the trust, you know I know it hurts,'' he told a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fundraiser in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>. But, he told reporters later in <LOCATION> Hershey </LOCATION>, `` Please do n't interpret that as criticism of -LRB- Attorney General -RRB- <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. `` Democrats are going to try to make some -LRB- political mileage on the -RRB- ` sleeze issue,''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. `` Let them try. There's plenty on the other side.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told reporters he had not yet begun the process of deciding upon a running mate, brushing aside questions on whether former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> might be under consideration. The former governor, now director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, accompanied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> swing. `` There's no list, long or short,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> complained Tuesday that scrapping over <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> issues overshadowed equally important matters during the state's Democratic primary race. `` We did n't hear about AIDS, we did n't hear about drugs,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. `` We did n't hear about homelessness. We did n't have a discussion on INF -LRB- intermediate-range nuclear forces -RRB-.'' The governor said the primary, won by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, did not bring about a `` full ventilation of all the issues.'' `` If you could get a composite <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> voter and read his or her mind, they would say, ` We're disappointed,''' he told reporters at the state Capitol. The governor also said, however, that his state's primary was not as divisive as some observers said it was. `` It is not accurate to say that this was an extremely negative campaign. That is simply not accurate. It is not accurate to say that there were obvious signs of severe racial tension,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- ... were quick to state that aside from the mayor's comments there was no harsh criticism from any political leaders,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. `` I saw no fruit thrown. I heard no ugly epithets from crowds. I saw no disorderly conduct. I saw no one unruly at debates. I saw no one struck or even abused in any way,'' he said. The governor said the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is a `` very important issue'' but one that seemed to have `` an eclipsing effect.'' Mideast issues, of major concern to the state's large bloc of Jewish voters, were magnified when <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> endorsed <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, in large part because of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s pro-Israel stance. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said Jews would have to be `` crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because of his attitudes toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state.

 A pre-dawn tornado exploded through this rural <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> community Tuesday, killing four people, destroying homes, throwing people from their beds and leaving much of a college campus in ruins. Only rubble was left in some neighborhoods after the tornado cut a swath 12 miles long and at least a half-mile wide about 4:30 a.m. Eighteen people suffered injuries requiring hospital treatment. The mobile home of two of those who were killed vanished from its lot, leaving only foundation blocks. Families were thrown out of bed while windows exploded and their homes collapsed on top of them. `` I woke up with a roaring sound and as soon as I woke up, the windows blew out on both sides of my bed, and the roof came down on top of me,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, who was pinned in the debris for three hours. His neighbor, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>, said she and her husband, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, had only moments to rush their three children, ages 4 to 11, into the bathroom before the tornado hit. `` They were screaming ` are we dying, are we dying?''' she said. `` Then it was over as soon as it started.'' It was <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s worst tornado since 1966 when a twister crossed the state from <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>, killing 11 and injuring 400 people. In 1962 a tornado on the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> killed 17 people and injured 100. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> flew to inspect the scene and said he intended to sign an emergency order allowing state and federal aid. `` It's been tragic,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. Lawmen from the state and surrounding counties were already on hand, and state prisoners were expected soon to help with the cleanup, said Sheriff <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Peavy </PERSON>. The twister's destructive path started in front of a shopping center and headed straight into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> <LOCATION> College </LOCATION>, where it `` totaled the new library and took the roof off the auditorium,'' <PERSON> Peavy </PERSON> said. College President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> estimated damage at between $ 20 million and $ 25 million. Three of the campus' 14 buildings were destroyed and nine heavily damaged, he said. It also demolished numerous homes, blew the roof off a nearby church, overturned cars and knocked down trees, <PERSON> Peavy </PERSON> said. It ripped apart the only obstetrical clinic serving a four-county area around <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, leaving 350 to 400 mothers a year without a place to have their babies, said <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Tri-County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. No one was injured there, however. The worst damage was in the vicinity of <LOCATION> Pinetta </LOCATION>, a cross-roads neighborhood near <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>. `` I almost fell to my knees it was so strong,'' said <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 69. His son's home across the street was destroyed. Also in <LOCATION> Pinetta </LOCATION>, the bodies of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lavelle </PERSON> <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON> were thrown 100 yards and their mobile home disappeared, leaving behind only a dozen cinder blocks on a bare patch of ground. Mrs. <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> of nearby <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, surveyed the damage a few hours after learning her sister had died. `` It did n't leave any of it. Not even a dish,'' she said disbelievingly. `` You'd never know there was a trailer here.'' Sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Botino </PERSON> identified the two other victims as <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dearmiste </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinesett </PERSON>. Of the 18 injuries, two of the more seriously hurt were flown 50 miles to <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> Memorial Regional Medical Center. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 14, was in serious condition Tuesday after surgery for a punctured kidney, and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was in fair condition with a chest injury, a spokesman said. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s age was unavailable. Two others remained in good condition in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, administrator <PERSON> Jeannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. About 100 miles to the west, two tornadoes touched down in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, causing two minor injuries and destroying three houses and a mobile home, as well as heavily damaging five other homes, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mader </PERSON>, the county emergency management director. The same storm that spawned the tornadoes swept through south <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> late Monday and early Tuesday, ripping off roofs, tearing down trees and injuring at least four people in mobile homes that were tossed about by strong winds.

 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said Tuesday he hoped his visit would advance political as well as church relations between <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He also said that years of religious restrictions in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had not hurt the spirit of its worshipers. The Roman Catholic prelate _ the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cardinal to visit <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> came to power in 1959 _ hugged Archbishop <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> after stepping off the private plane that brought him to <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> <PERSON> Airport </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He also shook hands with <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carneado </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> described his day in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, 430 miles away, as `` wonderful,'' and spoke glowingly of the reception he received at the Mass he celebrated there Monday night. `` The moment we arrived, they burst into thunderous applause, and the applause hardly stopped throughout the entire Mass. They applauded everything, and it was all spontaneous,'' he said. `` It was clear they were overjoyed by our visit and that the faith is very, very deep.'' <PERSON> O'Conner </PERSON> added, `` Despite the fact that there have been many restrictions in the past on the free exercise of their faith, it's there, it's still there. The cardinal said much of the enthusiasm was due to the presence of Monsignor <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> archdiocese </LOCATION>, who was a priest in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> before going to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1961. It was <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Valle </PERSON>'s first visit to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> since he left. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was invited here by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> bishops to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Varela </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> priest who served in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from 1823-53. `` It is my hope that <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Varela </PERSON> will form a bridge _ a bridge between the church in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the church in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. And who knows, when there is a strong bridge between the two churches, then perhaps, many others can go back and forth across that bridge and other kinds of peaceful reunion -LRB- may -RRB- take place between two peoples who are separated by such a small body of water and who together dream of peace,'' the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> archbishop said. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> one day after the 27th anniversary of the <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> government's victory at the Bay of Pigs over invading anti-communist Cuban exile forces, who were backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. When asked if it concerned him, he said `` Oh! Is that right? I did n't even think of that.'' He added, `` We'll pray for everybody who was involved and for all who lost their lives.'' It was n't known if the cardinal would meet with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> during his three days in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. His schedule includes private meetings with religous leaders. In 1985, a group of American archbishops met <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> during a visit to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` It would be very presumptuous of me to suggest I would be seeing him,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. But he added, `` anyone visiting any country is always available when the president of the country wishes to see him.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said his visit and that of other religious leaders to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in recent years indicated `` significant movement'' by the Cuban government in religious affairs, and he indicated he would be taking careful notes to report to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> is scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> this year. `` I would be surprised if the Holy Father did not want to try to visit <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> sometime in the future,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` I am unaware of any concrete plans, but clearly the Holy See would observe carefully the visit of any cardinal to any country to see how he was received and what the response was on the part of the government.'' Of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s 10.2 million people, an estimated 41 percent are <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>.

 Support from Jewish voters and a strong boost from white Catholics lifted <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to victory in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary Tuesday, while <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support came chiefly from black voters, polls said. Racial division was a prominent feature of the race, with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> winning a huge proportion of the black vote but just a moderate share of white votes, polls said. Still, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s white vote was more than twice its 1984 level. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' three-quarter share of the Jewish vote countered <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s black support, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> led well but not overwhelmingly among Hispanics, polls said. That left <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> whites as a swing vote, and many chose <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In incomplete returns, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> exit polls said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won about 70 percent of the white <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> vote, roughly 75 percent of the Jewish vote and 60 percent of the smaller group of white Protestants. The numbers could change slightly as final results came in. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won about 95 percent of the black vote, which made up about a quarter of the Democratic turnout, the ABC-Post, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> polls said. Jews and white Catholics each made up about 25 percent of the total as well. `` The Jewish and black cancel each other out, then the ethnic <PERSON> Catholic </PERSON> white vote is an important balance,'' said pollster I.A. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. `` It is going very strongly for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' Racial and religious antipathy marked the primary race _ Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said Jews would `` have to be crazy'' to support <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because of his position on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ and polls indicated that bad blood lingered. In early results from the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times exit poll, nearly two-thirds of the Democratic voters said they believed there was `` an element of racism involved in the vote against <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' while about another third said they believed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is anti-Semitic. `` There's a very strong racial element here _ bitter racial antagonism, I'd say,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. ABC News pollster <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> called it `` a dual electorate'' in which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won every demographic and socioeconomic group when blacks were factored out. `` It's the same old song: Blacks voting overwhelmingly for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whites less monolithic, but still, in this case, solidly for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won just 18 percent of the non-Jewish white vote; <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had it at roughly one-fifth, which would be about the same he got in the last two primaries, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. Among all whites, Jews included, the polls had <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with about 15 percent. As expected, black turnout was highest in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, accounting for 34 percent of the total in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll. <PERSON> Muzzio </PERSON> noted `` an element of negative voting'' in the returns; about a fifth of the voters said they were casting their ballots to stop a candidate from winning rather than to help a candidate they liked. Three-quarters of those negative voters went for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said. There was some weakness in the support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s poll said more than half his supporters wished someone else were running, and the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll said 72 percent of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' voters said they would have voted for Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> if he had been in the race. Moreover, `` Only one in five blacks tells us that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> really cares about people like them, and only three in 10 blacks have a favorable view of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll chief <PERSON> Laurily </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>. `` So he's got his work cut out in that community.'' Late pre-election polls gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a lead of 9 points or more, but pollsters stressed that turnout was the key _ chiefly, whether non-Jewish whites would turn out and boost <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or weaken him by staying home. Fully one-third of the voters told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> they had made their decision in the last seven days of the race; 57 percent of them went for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 23 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and 19 percent for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. Most of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s voters _ 70 percent _ made up their minds more than a month ago, and 80 percent backed him strongly, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said. But only half of his supporters said they thought the nation was ready to elect a black president. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said liberal voters went for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by a slim margin, 48 percent to 44 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Liberals made up 44 percent of the total, the poll said. Moderates, a third of the total, favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by 56-31; conservatives, 12 percent of the total, split 56-23. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did better with younger voters, the polls said, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> better with the older. Those most concerned with issues such as drug abuse or helping the poor and elderly backed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>; those concerned with the federal deficit and experience in office favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Pre-election polls never showed much movement toward Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>; his peak was 12 percent in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll late last week, after his endorsement by <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. He did best among conservative Democrats, the CBS-Times poll said, but was third even there to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> just did n't play well here at all,'' said <PERSON> Pama </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll analyst. The polls had a margin of sampling error of about 4 percentage points.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said `` I guess this was somebody else's Super Tuesday'' as New Yorkers turned thumbs down on his candidacy and he considered quitting the Democratic presidential race. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON>, a close friend and adviser, said the senator was weighing an end to his campaign after six weeks without a primary or caucus win. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> scheduled an announcement Thursday. `` I told him he should gracefully get out and let this one conclude,'' <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> said, `` I've always been a person when reality rears its head, recognize it, but do it gracefully and then go get a shoe shine. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Arlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Schardt </PERSON> told reporters here, `` I know the senator has n't made up his own mind. He has to talk to his advisers and close friends.'' But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> dropped his attack stance of late and sounded a call for unity as he spoke to supporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he finished a dismal third. `` I guess this was somebody else's Super Tuesday,'' he said. `` I want to congratulate <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for a really impressive victory. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is a real marathon and he beat us by a mile.

I never wanted to stop <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or stop <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.

I should not make any suggestions of what he plans to do,'' <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> state director <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said national campaign officials were reviewing the returns from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before making a decision. `` What I've been told is the campaign will see what it looks like tonight and the senator will talk to his advisers to see what direction the campaign will take,'' <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said.

 A fragmentation grenade blew up outside the American-Costa Rican Cultural Center Tuesday, wounding two Americans and four other people, Costa Rican authorities said. Red Cross officials identified the Americans as <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Feister </PERSON>, a professor at the Cultural Center from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> area, and <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartain </PERSON>, a student from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Feister was seriously wounded, but `` she's expected to pull through,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Krischick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Krischick </PERSON> said earlier Tuesday that the explosion was believed caused by a malfunctioning power line transformer. A preliminary report prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION> said the explosion was caused by a fragmentation grenade. Three cars were damaged, the report said. <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garron </PERSON>, the public security minister, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> officials had no suspects in the incident. He called the explosion `` a terrorist act.'' <PERSON> Garron </PERSON> said the grenade apparently was thrown onto a sidewalk near the Cultural Center. It may have been gone off underneath a car, one of the three automobiles parked near the complex that were heavily damaged. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alate </PERSON>, an explosives expert with the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said the device appeared to be an M-67 fragmentation grenade, capable of inflicting serious damage within a 100-yard range. Police said they had no witnesses. One person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was near the site, heard a loud explosion and later saw a cloud in the vicinity of the Cultural Center. He said one person next to the nearby Anglo-American school appeared to have been hurt by the blast. <PERSON> Krischick </PERSON> said <PERSON> Feister </PERSON> suffered a severe artery wound and was operated on immediately at <LOCATION> Calderon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. She was reported in fair condition. <PERSON> Bartain </PERSON> suffered head and knee lacerations but was said to be in good condition. She was expected to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday, a doctor at the hospital said. Her hometown was not immediately available. <PERSON> Krischick </PERSON> said Tuesday evening that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had been unable to confirm that the explosion was caused by a grenade. However, he noted Costa Rican officials `` were collecting evidence all day.'' `` We have n't had the opportunity to review the evidence,'' <PERSON> Krischick </PERSON> said. `` We will continue to review the situation.'' The spokesman, contacted by telephone, said the explosion occurred shortly after 8 a.m. -LRB- 6 a.m. EDT -RRB- about 50 yards south of the cultural center building in the eastern <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yoses </LOCATION> district The structure was not damaged, he said. President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> visited the injured in the hospital and later condemned the incident. `` This country, which is a haven of peace, one day could turn into a <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> invaded by terrorism and violence if we do n't adopt energetic measures to prevent it.'' The explosion follows an attack on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> April 7 by students enraged by the forced extradition of a suspected drug dealer to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said Tuesday he wo n't halt neighborhood anti-drug patrols despite an incident in which followers of <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> allegedly assaulted a suspected drug dealer. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, a group led by <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, had been summoned by frustrated residents of a neighborhood surrounding what police call one of the city's most notorious open-air drug marts. On Monday, according to police, a handful of <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> followers conducting an anti-drug patrol confronted a suspected drug dealer outside an apartment complex. The group allegedly beat the man after he produced a sawed-off shotgun, and beat a television reporter and cameraman when the two refused to turn over their film of the incident. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said that in spite of Monday's violence, his department had no intention of preventing members of the Nation of Islam from resuming their patrols. `` We're not going to do anything to restrict their activities,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` Obviously, what occurred yesterday was not within the framework of the law. There were law violations that occurred, and we are investigating.'' A man identified as a Nation of Islam member, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Merriweather </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, originally was charged with two counts of simple assault and one count of theft but the charges were changed Tuesday to one count of robbery in connection with the taking of a television camera. The suspected drug dealer, 25-year-old <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, was listed in stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, while the reporter, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> WRC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, was treated and released from <LOCATION> Sibley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` They were in hot pursuit of a news story, and we were in hot pursuit of a drug pusher,'' said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alim-Mohammed </PERSON>, a Nation of Islam spokesman. `` We apologize.'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who previously has said that he wants to train civilians to become part-time reserves to help his officers fight crime, pledged to talk with the group to iron out rules of conduct. `` We do not want them taking the law into their own hands,'' he said. `` We have to work within the realm of the law.'' According to police records, there were more than 1,300 adults and 67 juveniles arrested on drug charges in 1987 at the Mayfair Mansions apartment complex where Monday's incident occurred.

<TEXT>
 Contra leaders Tuesday held out little hope that a peace agreement with the Sandinistas could be reached within the 60-day timetable established March 23 but hailed the first round of talks as a `` triumph.'' The Contra directors returned from <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Monday night after three days of peace negotiations with the Sandinista government. The two sides did not reach an agreement but decided to meet again for three days beginning April 28. `` What the Sandinista government wants is an absence of war without eliminating the causes of war,'' said <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, one of the five directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance, as the rebels are formally called. He said the Contras will continue to insist on steps toward democracy before they agree to lay down their arms. But he and directors <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> hailed the visit itself as a victory, pointing out the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> originally refused to meet face to face. `` Our arrival in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> after everything the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> said was a triumph,'' said <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. `` The resistance is creating a unique precedent in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>. `` We are an intact guerrilla force negotiating in the capital without giving up our troops or our arms.'' There are difficult problems to solve before the negotiations can be completed, the Contra leaders said, saying the timetable agreed to in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, last month probably can not be met and will be extended. He dismissed questions about the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' sincerity, saying they had no choice but to negotiate because their political position inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was weak. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> noted that when the rebels toured the capital's streets in a small bus, Nicaraguans cheered, saluted and flashed them `` V'' signs.

 <PERSON> Arvind </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> should be the envy of most book publishers. As director of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, 44-year-old <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> heads an organization with a potential market of 283 million Indians. But not too many would like to work <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON>'s seven-day week as he tries to juggle 13 Indian languages and keep ahead of critics who say the trust publishes too few books in any one of them. The trust was set up in 1957 to produce and encourage the production of good literature at moderate prices _ a sweeping objective considering the size of the reading public and the diversity of languages. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people speak more than 1,600 dialects, and 15 languages are listed as official in the country's constitution. The 13 in which the trust publishes rant state. Some of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s languages, little known outside the country, are spoken by more people than some European tongues. Sixty million people speak Marathi and 62 million Telegu, almost as many as the 63 million people who speak Italian in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and far more than the 11 million who speak Greek or the 9 million in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> who speak that language. The trust's translations of Indian works include such books as `` Tin Malayalam Natak'' and the <LOCATION> Punjabi </LOCATION> version of `` Three Malayalam Plays,'' set in the shady jungles of <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION>. The translation involves a change in script _ <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s languages also are written in 13 different scripts _ and sees the book traveling 1,240 miles north to the dusty plains of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> where, <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> says, it is doing good business. Good business because the Punjabi translation adds 14 million potential buyers to the 22 million Malayalam-speaking population. A translation of a book from any other Indian language to Hindi, the national language, adds 153 million people to the potential market. The trust has recently published a book of Punjabi folk tales in <LOCATION> Urdu </LOCATION>, the Telugu novel `` What Was Left'' in <LOCATION> Punjabi </LOCATION> and the Hindi novel `` Darkness'' in <LOCATION> Urdu </LOCATION>, Gujarati, Marathi and Tamil. The story about <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s partition became a popular TV series. The trust also publishes many books in English which, though not an official Indian language, is spoken by most educated Indians. These range from historical works such as a biography of Guru <PERSON> Nanak </PERSON>, the first prophet of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Sikh faith, to books about <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s rivers, its Hindu temples and its orchids. Despite its exotic output, the trust has received severe criticism. A government committee complained the organization had published only 3,101 books since 1957 and has spent most of its funds on staff salaries. The trust receives a $ 3 million grant from the government. `` There were heavy losses due to underpricing and incorrect pricing of its publications,'' the government review said. <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> agrees but only in part. He says more books should have been published and he is planning a 70 percent increase in production this year which would add 250 titles. `` But we are not a commercial enterprise,'' he says. `` There will be losses because the books are underpriced as per government orders.'' The increase in production, <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> says, is only a token effort to tackle the problem: `` It's like a few drops of rain in a desert.'' Most of the additional titles will be in English and Hindi. But efforts will be made to increase translations into other Indian languages for what <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> calls `` unifying the country through literature.'' Language has been a prickly subject in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Riots have broken out in south <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> over what people view as the forcible imposition of Hindi, which is mainly spoken in the country's north. The trust steers clear of potential disputes by appointing advisory boards for each language to decide which books to publish. The trust's other responsibilities include participating in the government's plans to make 80 million more Indians literate by 1995. This means providing books for primary schools and adult education centers in more than 500 cities and towns. Only 35 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s people can now read and write. But <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> says the trust by itself can not fulfill the government's literacy campaign. `` We can support it but we can not hug it too hard,'' he says. `` We can not succeed on our own. We have to float on a current and that current will have to come from the people.''

<HEAD>Remake of Hitchcock Classic Only Pale Copy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The idea of remaking <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s psychological thriller `` Suspicion'' might one day prove interesting, but the makers of the new version airing on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> tonight produced only a pointless replica The new `` Suspicion,'' part of the PBS series `` American Playhouse,'' stars <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> in the <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine-Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> roles. Except for a 1980s veneer, nothing is changed, including the studio ending that <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> said he deplored. So why did n't these filmmakers do something daring like give the film the ending <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> said he wanted? `` Suspicion'' is the story of a dowdy young woman facing spinsterhood who is swept off her feet by a handsome, ne'er - do-well She marries him, then begins to suspect he's a murderer and that she's his next victim. <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> masterfully kept audiences off balance, one minute suggesting that charming <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Aysgarth </PERSON> was indeed a killer, the next revealing him as nothing more than an irresponsible spendthrift, his crimes a figment of his wife's imagination. Whether they were or not was the bone of contention between Hitch and the studio. It's hard to evaluate <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' performances, since they speak the same lines as <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>. For instance, when <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> crashes a party, causing his unwilling host to sputter, `` I do n't know what to say,'' he responds coolly, `` I suggest you say something, old boy, before you embarrass this man -LRB- indicating a butler -RRB- to death.'' No matter how good Andrews is, it's <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s line. <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Lina </PERSON> never seems to connect convincingly with <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> won an Oscar for the role in which she alternately feared and adored her handsome husband. <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, co-produced the movie with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> -LRB- a British filmmaker, not the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> director of `` Tin Men'' -RRB-. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Grieve </PERSON>, another Briton, directed by taking no chances. <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> and screenwriter <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Internecine Project'' -RRB- adapted the 1941 script by <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphaelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Reville </PERSON>. But almost nothing is changed from the <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> version save minor details, such as <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, a secretary, in lieu of <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>, the maid. Even <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>'s performance as <PERSON> Beaky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON>'s good-time friend, seems an impersonation of <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> in the original. The movie was based on a novel, `` Before the Fact,'' written by <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkeley </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> under the pseudonym <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Iles </PERSON>. In the novel, the husband really is a murderer, and his wife, after learning she is pregnant, willingly drinks the poisoned milk he serves her to keep him from procreating. According to <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> biographer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoto </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> refused to let the intended star at the time, <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, play a killer. <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> offered to produce a script as a study of paranoid fantasy. After delays, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> eventually were cast in the lead roles. As the shooting dragged on _ <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> became ill at one point _ many endings were written and more than one was filmed. When studio censors objected to pregnant <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> willingly taking poison, <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> added scenes suggesting she'd had an illicit affair, since it was OK for a character to commit suicide if the character had sinned. But a preview audience laughed at the scenes, according to <PERSON> Spoto </PERSON>. In another unused ending, <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> redeemed himself by joining the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. For the original `` Suspicion'' climax, <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> filmed <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> struggling in a speeding car by putting them on a soundstage with a moving backdrop. <PERSON> Grieve </PERSON> was able to shoot the scene using a real car on a real road on location in <LOCATION> Cornwall </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Such technical updating turns out to add nothing when compared to the original. One bow to the'80s: Before the harrowing car ride, <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> notes her seatbelt is broken, a problem <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> did n't mention in 1941.

<HEAD>When Interest Rates Rise, Should You Sell Stocks?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There's a wise old saying that when interest rates show signs of rising, it's a good time to consider moving your investments from stocks to bonds. It may be one of those times now. Believing in the theory is one thing, but believing in it strongly enough to make a basic investment change is a matter of a vastly different magnitude, since commissions and steep capital gains taxes could be involved. Still, since the theory seems to make sense, the temptation is there. When interest rates rise, the returns from bonds become relatively more attractive. As investors shift, the prices of stocks tend to become depressed. And as rates rise, corporate earnings may fall, depressing stocks further. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> DePaul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and current president and editor of the newsletter Investment Horizons, is among those who wondered if reality performed according to theory, and so he put the theory to the test. Using changes in the prime interest rate as a guide _ it was an arbitrary decision; others measures could have been used _ he traced the stock market's reactions from March 25, 1970. For experimental purposes, he assumed that on that date a 100 percent commitment was made to the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index and maintained until May 11, 1971, when the prime rate rose to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent. The commitment was then sold, and no stock investments were made until October 20, 1971, when the prime rate fell to 5.75 percent from 6 percent. Thereafter, he sold when the prime rose and bought when it fell. The result: A 462 percent gain in value, dividends excluded, which is more than double the 196 percent capital appreciation earned on a buy-and-hold strategy employed over the entire period. He concludes: `` Even if commissions and income taxes are accounted for, the prime rate portfolio readjustment strategy yields a significantly higher overall rate of return relative to implementation of a buy-and-hold strategy.'' But the story does n't end there. In fact, a very big question arises: What might have happened if you were n't able to hold the portfolio intact for that long period of time? What if you had needed to cash in? Answer: You might not have done very well, since the strategy would not have yielded the best results on all occasions. In fact, says <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON>, there were five periods when the strategy would have placed the investor in the stock market during times of declining stock prices. Similarly, on six occasions the strategy would have resulted in the investor sitting on the sidelines during periods of rising stock prices. Question: Would you, or most other investors, have been able to follow a strategy that failed to work on so many occasions, confident that over longer periods of time it would work out for the best? <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON> concedes it would have taken extreme patience for investors to have followed the theory, one of the reasons being it would have kept them on the sidelines for periods as long as 25 months. And, he acknowledges, the one investment axiom that has long stood the test of time is `` whatever has worked well in the past will most likely not work continuously in the future.'' Nevertheless, he expresses the opinion that `` history often contains lessons which, if learned and practiced, can improve one's well-being. This, he believes, is the case with the historical relationship between interest rates and stock market prices.

<BYLINE>All-American Methodists Seeking Their Idenity</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Often called the most typical of American denominations, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodism </ORGANIZATION> detects a blurring of its identity and is seeking to define it more clearly. That's an objective of the church's governing general conference, which starts next Tuesday in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and has before it proposed new summations of doctrine and mission. The 10,000-word doctrinal paper has stirred controversy, suggesting that theology _ the heart of belief _ is going to be a volatile topic of the 11-day meeting. Other issues, such has challenges to the 9.1-million-member denomination's stand against homosexual practice and against ordaining active homosexuals, have gained the most attention. But the proposed doctrinal exposition deals with the rudimentary expression of the church's character. At issue is the document's backing away from previous strong affirmations of diversity, or `` pluralism,'' in concepts and approaches, a variety that some see as reflecting vagueness. The new doctrinal paper seeks `` to move away from glorification of pluralism,'' says the Rev <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Heitzenrater </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, vice chairman of the commission that prepared the document. But some contend it is too restrictive. `` We believe that the proposed substitute to our current statement would move our church into a narrow sectarian and repressive stance,'' says a group of about l00 clergy. Others, however, maintain the tightening up is needed to counter a tendency toward ambiguity about belief. In any case, writes the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuhause </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a Lutheran, a tradition strong on theology: `` Whatever happens, it is certain that within <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodism </ORGANIZATION> today there is a seriousness about theology and church doctrine that did not exist a couple of years ago. `` That in itself is a most promising sign.'' Generally considered the most representative of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> denominations, Methodism took root at the country's origins, and moved west with the population, with Methodist circuit-riders common on the American froniter. The church is spread through all sections of the country, both rural and urban. Mostly middle class, it has only about 4 percent ethnic minority members, although it lately has emphasized ministry to them. The denomination initially arose in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> under <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON>'s leadership with a special mission _ to serve the working classes and socially neglected <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON>'s spirit-filled verve, not doctrinal exactitude, marked the movemenmt. Methodism retains much of its socially activist urge. But the scene now has changed, become more complex in a multi-cultural nation, and some say the church's vision and direction have clouded. Two scholars of Methodist-related <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Divinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> maintain that the denomination, the nation's second largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> body next to <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION>, is no longer just one church, but seven of them. In a 1985 study, `` The Seven Churches of Methodism,'' professors <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willimon </PERSON> say regionalism characterizes the denomination rather than any overall cohesion. `` Regional differences are a fact of life, and unless church leaders recognize and deal with those tensions, any attempts to have homogeneous ministries will be imposssible,'' says sociologist-researcher <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. He and <PERSON> Willimon </PERSON> say the denomination now consists of these seven `` churches'': The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> `` Yankee church,'' declining and absorbed in ecclesiastical tinkering; the `` Industrial Northeast'' church, once strong, but retreating to small towns; the `` Midwest Church,'' still a stable stronghold, the `` Church South,'' conservative and cohesive; the `` <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>,'' lively and fastest growing, the `` Frontier Church'' still with a frontier spirit, and `` the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>,'' something of an enigmatic mixture. The denomination, second largest in the nation next to Southern Baptists and Roman Catholics, emphasizes its variety in its present doctrinal statement, adopted in 1972, saying: The `` theological spectrum ranges over all the current mainstream options and a variety of special-interest theologies'' and the church sees `` positive virtues of doctrinal pluralism even within the same community of believers ... `` The viability of all doctrinal opinion demands that the processes of theological development must be kept open-ended.'' In the proposed new doctrinal statement, developed in four years of work by a 22-member committee, puts the emphasis on Scripture as `` the primary source and criterion for authentic Christian truth and witness.'' The other three guides that <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> put alongside Scripture _ tradition, experience and reason _ are described as aiding in grasping the meaning of Scripture, subordinate to it. `` <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodists </ORGANIZATION> as a diverse people continue to strive for consensus in understanding the gospel,'' the document says. `` Our task is to articulate our vision in a way that will draw us together as a people in mission. `` In the name of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> we are called to work within our diversity while exercising patience and forebearance with one another.''

 After the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> canceled plans to publish a book by a bishop advocating relaxed sexual views, it was snapped up by a major commercial publisher, <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Row. The author, Episcopal Bishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> <PERSON> Spong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, voiced delight at the outcome. He said the Methodist publisher, <ORGANIZATION> Abingdon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, had commissioned the book, but was `` so intimidated by reactionary critics'' that it backed out of the project only a month before publication. However, <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Row said it would keep that schedule, issuing <PERSON> Spong </PERSON>'s `` Living in Sin? A Bishop Rethinks Human Sexuality,'' on May 15. <PERSON> Spong </PERSON> suggests approving single adult sex relations and homosexual unions. <LOCATION> Abingdon </LOCATION> says it dropped the book because of keen feelings about sexual issues confronting the church's governing conference April 26-May 6. President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feaster </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Abingdon </LOCATION> said it did n't want to aggravate the controversy <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> editor <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> called the book prophetic, saying its `` bold proposals'' will `` undoubtedly thunder on to the discussion agendas of virtually every ecclesiastical institution.''

 What happens when one of the biggest grossing movies of the season hits the home video market? The happy studio that owns it makes sure there are enough copies available for sale and rental and launches a $ 1 million advertising campaign. As if `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop II'' would need much promotion. The movie, starring <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> in a reprise of his role as a hip and irreverent <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> cop let loose in ever so chic and snotty <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, has raked in more than $ 153 million for <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> since its release in May 1987. According to <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Doctorow </PERSON>, senior vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, distributors, retailers and mail order firms had already ordered over 500,000 videocassettes of the movie by March. Avid <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> fans, ignoring the dousing the movie received last year from critics, are already lined up at video stores for copies of `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop II,'' available on VHS for $ 89.95 and Beta for $ 29.95. Another Paramount megahit, `` The Untouchables,'' the <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> gangland action thriller that won an Academy Award for <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, is available on videocassette on April 20. The movie has grossed more than $ 76 million since its release last year and is priced at $ 89.95 for VHS and $ 29.95 for Beta. Elsewhere, <ORGANIZATION> Vestron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> has announced that it will release a video version of <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s Broadway production of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s `` Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' Starring <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> as the unbending family patriach <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON>, the VHS video, priced at $ 59.98, will be available on June 22. <ORGANIZATION> Vestron </ORGANIZATION> will also release <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Babenco </PERSON>'s `` Ironweed'' in June. Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the movie won Oscar nominations for co-stars Meryl Streep and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>. Videos reviewed this week: `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop II'' -LRB- VHS _ $ 89.95, Beta _ $ 29.95, Rated R -RRB- <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> is back as <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, tooling around undercover in a red Ferrari as <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s answer to <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> until the shooting of his buddy Police Capt. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogomil </PERSON> carries him back to <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. There he teams up with Rosewood -LRB- Judge <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> -RRB- to chase down a pack of gun smugglers, triggering a non-stop round of shootouts, broken glass, squad car smash-ups and exploding trucks. Anyone who has the sneaking feeling they've seen all this before is right. Director <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> -LRB- `` Top Gun'' -RRB- took the formula that proved so successful the first time around and slapped it on film again, chocking up 1987's biggest box-office winner in the process. Unfortunately, this version has more of everything except the thing it needs most: <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> being funny. The writers toss in some scraps of character development, telling us that <PERSON> Bogomil </PERSON> has a daughter, <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> has a divorce-happy wife and <PERSON> Rosewood </PERSON> has a gun fetish. This go-round also has <PERSON> Rambo </PERSON>'s former squeeze, <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> _ nostrils flared _ destroying massive amounts of property without so much as smudging her makeup And it includes a gratuitous stop at the Playboy mansion where <PERSON> Hef </PERSON> himself gets to say a few words, such as they are. There's an R-rating and lots of profanity. There's more noise but less really graphic violence than the original; adolescent boys probably would like it a lot. <PERSON> Diehard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> fans will want to catch his occasional funny moments. For others, the laughs might prove too few and far between to make this worth tolerating. _ By <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryckman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer

 `` Less Than Zero'' -LRB- CBS @ <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, VHS @ Beta stereo, and available closed captioned for the hearing impaired, $ 89.98, Rated R -RRB- Naming this movie `` Less Than Zero'' was a forfeit to critics: Who among them could resist giving this dumb, sentimental <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> version of <PERSON> Bret </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>' novel less than zero? The release of the video provides another chance to give it one last kick in the rump. The movie stars <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, an attractive young guy whose acting skills are unfortunately limited to a -RRB- smirking and b -RRB- gawking. He plays <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>, a reasonably grounded college student who has come home for the holidays to find that his budding bimbo girlfriend -LRB- <PERSON> Jami </PERSON> <PERSON> Gertz </PERSON> -RRB- has been consorting with an old school chum -LRB- <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> -RRB-, who is busy flushing himself down the tubes because of drugs. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>' book of the same title _ it has little else in common with the movie _ was a declaration of insignificance, a scary ramble through the lives of visionless, overprivileged, untended youth. The book's pointlessness was its point. The movie is immediately hobbled by a contrived good vs. evil plot. Even the soundtrack is vapid with such tunes as the Bangles' remake of `` Hazy Shade of Winter.'' <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanievkska </PERSON> -LRB- `` Another Country'' -RRB- directed.

Is this woman hip and liberated, or just cruising for a disease? <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ringwald </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> is either sullen or whiny and sometimes both, the perfect foil for the vacuous <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, who spends the rest of the movie mooning after her and scheming to help rustle up the money her alcoholic father owes a drug-dealing thug. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Randy </PERSON>'s father, and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Keitel </PERSON>, as the thug, provide the only real mystery in this utterly predictable 81 minutes: How did these two excellent character actors get mixed up in this insipid piece of celluloid? Little acting, even less action and lines such as, `` You know what this cheeseburger is like?

 `` Blow Up Your Video'' -LRB- <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> -RRB- _ AC @ <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> It may surprise those who lived through it, but the 1970s are now regarded as a golden age for heavy metal rock. A glance at magazine covers attests to <LOCATION> Led </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zeppelin </LOCATION>'s continued deification. <PERSON> Aerosmith </PERSON> has returned to the charts and even <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Nugent </PERSON> has a new record in the stores. Australian hard rockers AC @ <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> hope their new `` Blow Up Your Video'' album can return them to a place of prominence. It just might. Years on the road have taught this band that sparkling originality is much less a prerequisite for heavy metal success than a loud noise that packs a wallop. <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> may be looking more ridiculous every year in his English schoolboy's outfit, but it probably reassures the kids that he knows what they like. AC @ <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> delivers songs of alienation and macho posturing with muscle. `` Blow Up Your Video'' has a series of solid riffs, even though some sound a little too familiar. With `` That's the Way I Wan na Rock' n' Roll,'' <ORGANIZATION> AC </ORGANIZATION> @ <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> joins a long list of Led Zeppelin immitators. `` Heatseeker'' is the kind of good-time rocker that could become an anthem for teen-aged boys out looking for girls or trouble, or both. `` This Means War,'' with a rhythm that shifts into overdrive, is a headbanger's delight. The remainder of the songs falls into that great mass of metal that all tends to sound the same after awhile. At least AC @ <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> has the sense to avoid turgid ballads. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s voice never gets lower than a howl, or occasional growl. `` Highway to Hell'' and `` Back in Black'' have always been considered AC @ <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION>'s peaks. `` Blow Up Your Video'' wo n't cause any reassessments, but the band is n't ready for a rest home of 1970s stars. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Dancing in the Dark'' -LRB- Milestone -RRB- _ <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> In his first studio date in four years, <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> once again seduces us with his sweet and swinging tenor saxophone. There are several new compositions by the jazz vituoso on `` Dancing in the Dark,'' which blends calypso, pop, reggae and bebop. His ballad, `` Promise,'' is a lovely tune that allows him some lyrical riffs with the sax. Another ballad, `` Just Once,'' made popular by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> years ago, is a good stab at contemporary pop. <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>' `` Duke of Iron'' is pure Trinidadian calypso fun. `` Dancing in the Dark'' opens with a lovely sax solo by <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, and illuminates all the right romantic licks of the <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz-Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON> 1930s hit that was first introduced in the revue, `` The Band Wagon.'' Another'30s hit, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>'s `` I'll String Along With You,'' has been rearranged by <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> into a reggae beat. It is part of <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>' artistry that always stretches to do something just a little different _ to keep jazz not only traditional but fresh without selling out to fusion. As a jazzman and all-around musician, <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> shines on `` Dancing in the Dark,'' demonstrating his mastery of bebop, melodic ballads, toe-tapping dance tunes and music just to kick back with. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 Veteran actress <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Havilland </PERSON> believes that preparation is the key to success in everything.

The scene around the Shrine Auditorium on the afternoon of April 11 was one of panic: bumper-to-bumper limos in all directions; nominees Meryl Streep and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> -LRB- nine months pregnant -RRB- abandoned their limos to tramp down the city streets in their evening gowns. So did <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Havilland </PERSON>. But unlike scores of others in the same plight, she exhibited her customary Melanie-like calm. `` One limousine after another disgorged its passengers,'' she recalled with a lilting laugh. `` There was a whole parade of people in black tie and evening dress striding along, and I wish you could have seen the bemused households along the way. They stood there not believing what they were looking at: this marvelous procession. Out came a few discreet cameras, snapping the spectacle. `` One sight I thought very droll: These stretch limousines look very invincible, the white ones especially, but there was one of them in the most undignified position, with its nose up in the air, resting on a tow truck.'' Miss de Havilland arrived at the Shrine on time _ she was the third presenter and recipient of a standing ovation. The reason for her calm, she said, was preparation. `` I went down to the Shrine twice on Friday and for the run-through on Saturday,'' she said. `` I wanted to be sure where everything was. There were numerous details you needed to know for things to go smoothly. Thank heaven I did. `` Walking the eight blocks, my dress had to be held, and the sensitive material crumpled. I knew exactly where the wardrobe was. I needed powdering, and I knew where the makeup was. I also knew the number of my table -LRB- at the Board of Governors Ball -RRB-, and I think we were the first to be seated.'' What was her reaction to best actress <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s revealing appearance? `` Oh, I think she's such a rascal,'' Miss de Havilland said amusedly. `` She has the most beautiful figure in the world, and a marvelous face. I must say I thought she was wearing black velvet. Then I realized she was just wearing lace _ and nothing else! I let out a gasp, and then I thought, ` Oh, is n't she funny. She put that on just to make people do that.''' The Shrine Auditorium held special significance for Miss de Havilland. Forty-two years ago on the same stage she won her first Academy Award as best actress for `` To Each His Own.'' Three years later she collected her second Oscar for `` The Heiress.'' The name <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Havilland </PERSON> evokes a flood of memories for anyone familiar with films. She would be an icon if she had made only one movie: the eternal `` Gone With the Wind.'' However, she is famed for much more, from `` A Midsummer's Night Dream'' to `` Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte.'' She has been a star since 1934, when she arrived in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> as a 17-year-old from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. She and her sister, actress <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, were born in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. She co-starred seven times with <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, romanced with <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON>, feuded with her sister, married novelist <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> who was 18 years her senior. The marriage resulted in son <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> and divorce. Daughter <PERSON> Gisele </PERSON> was born from the marriage to French magazine editor <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Galante </PERSON>. They were divorced in 1979. While she reveres her <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> past, that's not where she lives. Strikingly beautiful at 71, she is very much a woman of today. Her home remains an elegant townhouse near the <LOCATION> Bois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bologne </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, but she travels to locations for such TV movies as `` Anastasia'' and this month's `` The Woman He Loved.'' The actress is now becoming acquainted with the world of rock music since her daughter became engaged to French pop idol <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Halliday </PERSON>. `` He is a national institution,'' Miss <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Havilland </PERSON> marveled about the singer, who is 13 years older than <PERSON> Gisele </PERSON>. `` I saw him and <PERSON> Gisele </PERSON> just before I left, and I said, ` You'll have to excuse me, but I have to start being very informed. I asked, from his point of view, the most inane question: ` What is the difference between a mandolin and a guitar?' He was very polite about it.''' The thought of <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON> attending a rock concert may seem bizarre, but it happened. While she was filming `` The Woman He Loved'' in <LOCATION> Villefranche </LOCATION>, the producer arranged a three-hour drive so she could attend a Halliday concert in <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION>. She sat with <PERSON> Giselle </PERSON> up front next to the sound and light controls. `` <PERSON> Gisele </PERSON> was very anxious to see how her mother would react to a rock concert,'' the actress said. `` I had never attended one. Very soon after the music began, it's such an impelling rhythm that I found myself going -LRB- knees bobbing -RRB- and my feet started to tap away. I could not keep still.'' After the concert, <PERSON> Halliday </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gisele </PERSON> and Miss de Havilland were taken by motorcycle-escorted limousine to a quiet bistro. `` That was the night he asked me for <PERSON> Gisele </PERSON>'s hand,'' the actress said. `` I was startled because it was only the second time I had met him. I said, ` W ... w ... well ... yes.'''

<HEAD>The Artists: Italians Examine Past With Phoenician Exhibit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS REDMONT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Italians have launched into a wide-scale introspection of their past with the largest exhibit ever assembled on the Phoenicians, the ancient traders who colonized the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and created the basis of the modern alphabet. New books, public debates, magazines articles, TV documentaries, T-shirts, imitation jewelry and greeting cards help celebrate a $ 6.5 million exhibit which has attracted record crowds and started to correct some of the fallacies spread against the Phoenicians. `` Because history is always written by the conquerors and never by those vanquished, the Phoenicians went down as the bad guys, the most hated people in the ancient times,'' said <PERSON> Sabatineo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moscati </PERSON>, the archaeologist who assembled the exhibit at <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>'s 18th century <PERSON> Palazzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassi </PERSON>. `` For centuries they were believed to be infant-killers, sharp and dishonest traders, pirates and kidnappers,'' he said. `` The commercial and military power of <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION> -LRB- Phoenician for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> -RRB- turned them into the rivals of the Romans, who systematically destroyed them in 146 B.C. after trouncing <PERSON> Hannibal </PERSON> and his elephants.'' <PERSON> Moscati </PERSON>'s exhibit brings together archeological discoveries unearthed since 1960 in the first attempt at a definitive public study of the Phoenicians and their world. It stretched from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, and included forays as far as <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and even around the tip of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Model galleys float their way across a large indoor pool, while a huge plaster wave looms in the background. At the entrance, tablets, graves and sarcophagi poke out of large sand dunes with their lids open, as if to invite visitors to raise a civilization from the dead. One room displays piles of almonds, nuts, spices, flower petals and dyes, emulating a Phoenician market place. And on the walls overlooking more than 1,200 objects on display from museums and collections in 11 countries, there are painted quotations from ancient sources, including the Old Testament, and recent authors. The Phoenicians emerged as a historically recognizable society around 1200 B.C. in what is now <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Their history encompasses the pre-Christian millenium from the Old Testament's Canaan to the Punic Wars between <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION>. The Phoenicians are generally credited with the invention of the alphabet, changing symbols to phonetic signs. `` Alph,'' originally in the shape of an ox's head, meant ox, while `` beth'' was a schematic square floor plan and meant house. Phoenician letters that turned into present-day usage included: `` M,'' a wavy line representing water; `` N,'' a slithering snake; and `` H,'' a man with his arms raised in jubilation. Phoenician cities spread over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> from Tyre and <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sardinia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. They were the only people capable of making a highly prized purple dye called phoinix _ which gave them their name _ from a murex shell, which was reserved only to Byzantine emperors and their families. According to the ancient historian <PERSON> Herodotus </PERSON>, Phoenician navigators are believed to have sailed around <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> over 2,000 years before the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> explorers because they reported the midday sun stood in the North instead of the South. `` The Phoenicians were the real inventors of private enterprise, foreign trade and door-to-door sales,'' economist <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvatorelli </PERSON> said. `` They would drop off their salesmen in various ports, let them fan out toward the interior and pick them up on the way back with what they had bartered. They also acted as the wholesale movers for other parties and created the ancestor of today's container _ enormous pitchers in which they moved dyes and other liquids.'' Phoenician craftsmen sent by <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyram </PERSON> of Tyre were said to have built <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>'s temple in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. While modern discoveries showed that Egyptians and not Phoenicians had discovered glass, the traders developed an entire industry based on glass. Incense burners, perfume bottles and delicate blue and white necklaces and bracelets grace the exhibit cases. `` The talents of the Phoenicians are much closer to what Italians are like today than is commonly believed,'' <PERSON> Salvatorelli </PERSON> said. Although Saint <PERSON> Augustine </PERSON> reported that Punic books contained `` many wise things,'' the only existing Phoenician writing today is a treatise on agriculture translated into Latin. And since they left so few records of themselves, the little that is known about them recently was written by other nations. One of the mysteries <PERSON> Moscati </PERSON> claims to have solved regards charges by ancient writers that Phoenicians threw newborn babies into the flames as a sacrifice to the gods. However, new finds and scientific analysis show that the babies' `` sanctuaries'' were places for sacred cremation of already dead babies or fetuses. `` There still remains much of the Phoenician world to discover,'' <PERSON> Moscati </PERSON> said. `` Countries like <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> have not really been explored. And in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, everything is at a standstill.'' `` But in the meantime the biggest surprise for the Italians has been to discover how widespread the Phoenician colonization was on their territory. Besides most of their emporia on the continental coast, one-third of <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> Sardinia </LOCATION> was in their hands.'' The exhibit closes Nov. 6.

<HEAD>Music Makers: More Talking Heads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was in a hotel bathtub in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> when he wrote lyrics for `` No More Flowers'' for the Talking Heads. This is just one bare fact the group revealed when talking about themselves in an interview to promote their latest LP, `` Naked.'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, the group's lead singer and lyricist, was in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> to visit his wife, costume designer <PERSON> Adele </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, who was doing a play there. `` I would work with this microcassette recorder,'' he said. `` I would have it sitting just outside the tub. I would reach out and speak into it. I'd be singing in the tub. I'd catch a phrase that I thought was apropos; I'd put it on the little recorder.'' The album is on their new label, Fly Records. It jumped onto Cashbox magazine's best-selling album chart at No. 20 on April 2. `` This record actually goes back to our earliest songs and albums ` Remain in Light' -LRB- 1980 -RRB- and ` Speaking in Tongues' -LRB- 1983 -RRB-, where we would each contribute ideas,'' said drummer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON>. `` We rented a rehearsal studio in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and each threw out ideas. We had a little cassette recorder and had all our instruments there. We'd take an idea, play it and play it, trading instruments, until it fell apart. Then we'd strike up a new idea. We ended up after 10 days with many snippets of songs. `` We went to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> into a recording studio and commenced to put them all together into song form.'' They went to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for several reasons. They laid down tracks with Paris-based Third-World musicians who play <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zuok </LOCATION> and Algerian-Moroccan rai. <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> said they also wanted to hang out together, which they're more apt to do in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where they have different sets of friends. `` My feeling is that lately there has been less openness here,'' said <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, the group's lead singer and lyricist. `` I wanted to get away from that feeling. There is that kind of vibe here that whatever is Top 10 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is all there is. There is a lot going on in other places.'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Weymouth </PERSON> met at the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION>, and still design their striking album packages. They added <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> to the trio and put out their first album in 1977. <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Badarou </PERSON>, who played keyboards on `` Speaking in Tongues,'' found the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> studio and brought in other musicians. `` One guitarist had a big smile the entire time he was playing with us,'' <PERSON> Weymouth </PERSON> said. `` When you're putting down music with that kind of heartfelt feeling, you know it's coming across in the record.'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said the album has two moods. `` This organic, larger band is primarily on the first side of the album,'' he said. What Weymouth terms `` the more experimental or ominous'' songs are on Side 2. After 15 basic tracks were recorded, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> improvised melodies and then wrote the words. `` I heard a story about a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> screenwriter who, when it was time to write a script, would rent a hotel room at the <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> and lock himself in the bathroom,'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said. `` His secretary would deliver food. He did n't allow himself to go out of there until it was all done. He could barely afford to stay there. He had to work every day. `` I tried lyrics for all 15. On some the words and melodies were n't quite right. It was nice that we had enough. There was one about marijuana _ it's a great song. Too bad. It was lagging behind in the race for the record so it did n't make it.'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, who is British, married the American <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> last July in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> has a son who is 1 years old, and <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON>, who are married, have two sons, who are 5 and 2. Since they all have individual commitments to pursue the next Talking Heads project probably will be another album instead of a tour. `` I put together ` Storytelling Giant,' a compilation of all the band videos, and shot some extra material to go between them, to kind of link them. `` I hope to direct another movie, with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, in the summer in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. That's still in the planning stage. We did something a couple of years ago, ` The Knee Plays.' I think that's going into a theater in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s last film was `` True Stories,'' a musical romp about an `` average'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> also composed music for some scenes in <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>'s `` The Last Emperor,'' which won nine Acaemy Awards. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who produced the <ORGANIZATION> BoDeans </ORGANIZATION>' `` Inside Looking Out,'' is putting together a band to tour behind the album he just released on <ORGANIZATION> Sire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, ` Casual Gods.' `` I did ` Casual Gods' in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> in a basement studio,'' he said. `` My mother was ill and my father had passed away. I went back to <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> to take care of her whenever I could be there. I found a basement studio I could rent by the week rather than by the hour, owned by the younger brother of someone I had grown up with. `` Musicians would pass through town or I used local musicians. I was paying for it myself. When I was offered a production job I would always do it. That caused my record to extend over the years. I think it made it much better. The songs are more diverse and I think my singing got better.'' <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION> said she and <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> just finished `` Conscious Party'' by <PERSON> Ziggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marley </PERSON> and the Melody Makers. It is their only production outside of the <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Club </PERSON>. `` We are going into the studio to finish up our third <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Club </PERSON> record,'' <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> said. `` After it's released in June, I think we'll tour in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. We're in demand in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Ziggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marley </PERSON>, who's 19, writes all the material. His brother <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>, 15, sings one song. <PERSON> Cedella </PERSON> is 20. <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, who's a mother of two, sing backgrounds.'' The Melody Makers, formed by the late reggae king <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Marley </PERSON>, have been around since <PERSON> Ziggy </PERSON> was 8. `` It's hard for me to imagine doing all this when I was 19,'' remarked <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Cambodian Nightmare Lives On for Author</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES REINDL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The physical torture is over for <PERSON> Haing </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON>, former doctor, <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> refugee, movie actor and now author and activist. But the nightmares wo n't stop, and he ca n't forgive himself for being the only member of his immediate family to survive four hellish years under the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the Cambodian communists who seized power in 1975. `` Yes, I have survivor's guilt,'' he says, sitting in a luxury suite at a plush <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hotel. `` And every night I still have nightmares and I will never be forgiven by my memory for watching my wife die, watching my parents tortured by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, beaten by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON>, 40, won an Academy Award in 1985 for his first acting role when he portrayed <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Dith </PERSON> <PERSON> Pran </PERSON> in `` The Killing Fields.'' His own tale of survival under the brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime is told in `` Haing Ngor: A Cambodian Odyssey'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MacMillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 19.95 -RRB-, which <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON> wrote with journalist <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>. The book is an understated account of life in a country savaged first by civil war, then by <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> occupation. <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON> writes of scrounging for edible insects to stay alive. He writes of watching his wife die in childbirth because helping her would reveal he was a doctor and mean his own certain death. And he writes of torture _ his own and others'. No embellishment could add to the horror that comes through in this straight accounting. `` They tied my upper arms to the cross and then my thighs and my feet,'' <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON> writes about one of the three times he was imprisoned and tortured. `` Then they threw the rope attached to the top of the cross over the goalpost and hoisted me up until my feet were above the pile of wood and rice hulls. I swayed there, back and forth. `` After the guards tied all of the prisoners they went around to each pile of rice hulls and lit it with cigarette lighters. `` Rice hulls have a consistency like sawdust. Fires with rice hulls give off thick, stinging smoke and burn slowly, for days.'' The war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> spilled over into <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, but the country's own civil war racked what had been for centuries a sleepy, agrarian culture where government corruption was accepted For many Cambodians of mixed ancestry, the native, dark-skinned Khmers of the countryside seemed to pose no danger. But in 1975, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> won control of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, renaming it <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION>. Americans were airlifted out of the country and many well-off Cambodians _ such as <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON>, with his medical degree, <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> and merchant family background _ left too. But he stayed. `` I could n't believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> would do what they did,'' <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON> said. `` I could n't believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> would be so brutal, so cruel. And not only me, the other educated people thought the same way.'' As part of their purge, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> relocated the population, emptying the cities and forcing residents into the countryside. There are estimates 2 million to 3 million Cambodians died under the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. On the day the capital, <ORGANIZATION> Phnom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penh </ORGANIZATION>, fell to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON> was operating on a wounded government soldier. He left the patient to die, beginning his own struggle for survival. <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON>'s four years of hell did n't end until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON> had made his way to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and then to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and his new home in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` A Cambodian Odyssey'' began taking shape in a Thai refugee camp, <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON> says. It took two years to write. The book is a memorial to `` my wife, my family ... and ... the people that were killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON> says. But both the book and the movie were a catharsis as well. <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON> says he's seen `` The Killing Fields'' only once. `` I did n't want to watch, because it seemed like it would bring back all my memories,'' he says `` Why I decided to do it, because before I crossed the border, I go to my wife's grave and say, ` Sweet, one day I will tell our story to the world.' `` Secondly, I know that film is very touching, but I have to tell the world and I have not only the movie, but ... I ... write that book.'' <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON> still lives in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and he says he's devoting some of his book and movie earnings to building hospitals for refugees along the <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, which remains under Vietnamese occupation. A <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON> filters his experience through his belief in karma, the cycle of birth, suffering and rebirth. `` Maybe in my last life before this one, I did something wrong to hurt people,'' he says. `` But this life, I paid back ... Please, next life do not separate my family and my wife. `` I want to have my whole family. And, I do n't want to see that kind of torture.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Career Of Johnny Cash Cited</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>, the ebony-clad singer whose mournful and mirthful songs have been entertaining country music fans for 32 years, is being celebrated in a special exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame. The $ 70,000 exhibit includes photographs, costumes, posters, films of his early TV appearances, one of his first guitars and such personal mementos as a Frederick Remington bronze. A million people are expected to see the exhibit during the next two years on <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>'s Music Row _ a section of the city that pioneers such as Cash helped to make. `` There's a lot of memories here,'' said the 56-year-old Cash, known as `` the man in black'' because of the color he wears to remind people of the downtrodden. `` It's a terrific display,'' he said. `` I'm very proud of it.'' Cash rose from the black dirt of an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> farm to peaks that few in country music can match. He has recorded nearly 1,500 songs, many of them focusing on the toil of achieving the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. His themes have made him a forerunner of such performers as <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cougar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellencamp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON>. His albums `` Folsom Prison,'' `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION>'' and `` Greatest Hits'' have sold more than 2 million copies each. He has won seven Grammy awards, including two he shared with wife <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who's at his side as often as his guitar He has received 23 songwriting awards as the composer of hits such as `` Folsom Prison Blues,'' `` I Walk the Line,'' `` Big River,'' `` I Got Stripes,'' `` A Boy Named Sue'' and others. His compositions also include `` Tennessee Flat Top Box,'' which was recently a No. 1 country hit by daughter <PERSON> Rosanne </PERSON>. However, he may be in the twilight of his recording career. His recent records have not been hits on the country charts. `` I do n't know if this will be my last album or not,'' he said about his forthcoming LP, which includes duets with several major stars. `` But it's time I got all my old friends into the studio to sing with me. Just in case.'' Over the years, Cash has entertained <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidents, had a network TV show, starred in more than a dozen movies and sold more than 50 million records. He also has developed a reputation for having some of the best informal music gatherings ever held. Those who have grabbed guitars and performed at his palatial lakeside home include <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristofferson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gatlin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Waylon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baez </PERSON>. He's also fished with <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>. Cash and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> are longtime close friends. `` He's been like a brother to me,'' <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. `` He's one of the greatest people in the world.'' Among Cash's humanitarian ventures over the years have been dozens of benefit concerts at prisons. These concerts, and the songs he sings about prison, have fueled a popular misconception that he is an ex-convict. He did have an addiction problem in the 1960s which he overcame late in that decade. His writing has not been restricted to songs. His 1975 autobiography, `` Man in Black,'' sold 1.3 million copies. His more recent `` Man in White'' is about the conversion of the Apostle <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. He said in 1980 when elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame, `` Many can sing country music, but not many ARE country music. It's the stylists that have made country music what it is today -LRB- and -RRB- given country music a shot in the arm So do it your way. Do n't let yourself get caught in a bag.'' The Country Music Hall of Fame exhibit, following similar ones about <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, drew from items Cash and his wife had collected. `` Some of my favorite artifacts and bronzes are here,'' Cash said. `` I wanted to make it a little more personal than average museums. So I took pen and paper and wrote down my thoughts.'' There are 130 photographs, 80 artifacts and 40 screen productions and video clips. Someone asked Cash how he collected so many items. `` One at a time,'' he said.

 Bond and commodity prices have risen on inflation fears sparked by a resurgence of violence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, although the stock market finished only slightly lower. Separately on Monday, the government reported that factory operating rates declined during March, the second straight monthly decline in the statistic despite a rebound at auto plants. In reaction to reports that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces destroyed two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian mine attack on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate, the yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year issue jumped to 9.01 percent _ its highest level in three months _ from 8.94 percent late Friday. The rise in interest rates helped depress the stock market, where the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 5.81 points to close at 2,008.12. Investors were concerned that stocks could suffer declines if bond yields continue to rise. Gold and oil prices rose. Analysts said oil production from other sources sharply would diminish the impact of any cutoff of oil from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> states, but they said the market reacted with typical skittishness at the prospect. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, closed at $ 18.52 per barrel, up 15 cents from Friday's closing price on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Contracts for refined products also rose. In the currency markets, the prospect of an oil shortage pushed the British pound to a six-year high against the dollar. Traders said tensions in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> put the spotlight on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil fields The pound rose to $ 1.9050 from $ 1.9004 on Friday. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities operated at 82.3 percent of capacity last month, down from an operating rate of 82.4 percent in February. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories had operated at 82.6 percent of capacity in January, the highest level in more than eight years. Analysts said the small declines in the operating level over the past two months were not worrisome and represented cutbacks in industries trying to work down high inventories of unsold goods.

<HEAD>Irving Accepts `White Knight' Cash Tender Offer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The `` white knight'' that <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sought for help in its bitter battle against hostile suitor <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> turned out to be <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second-largest bank. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said Monday that state-run <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to acquire a 51 percent stake in Irving for $ 65 a share in cash, or $ 617.5 million, countering <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s overtures. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> also announced a complex restructuring plan that includes the sale of its 50-story Wall Street headquarters, a cost-cutting program and a boost in its annual stock dividends. The company put the total value of the cash offer and restructuring at between $ 1.1 billion to $ 1.2 billion. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said the deal would allow <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> management to retain control of the company, although the board of directors would be expanded to include four <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> representatives. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> tender offer, which begins today, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> shareholders will get a special dividend of $ 10 a share upon completion of the deal, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said. The company said stockholders could receive cash for about half of their shares, and retain the other half. `` Our shareholders will benefit far more from the affiliation with BCI than the proposal advanced from <ORGANIZATION> BNY </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' Irving Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> stated. `` Irving anticipates increases in its revenues as a result of its ongoing relationship with BCI.'' <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s announcement comes just days after <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> shareholders voted to support management's $ 1 billion-plus hostile offer for <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> last month began a tender offer of $ 15 in cash and 1.575 of its common shares for each of Irving's roughly 18.1 common shares outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which holds a 4.9 percent stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, also is running a slate of 16 nominees to <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board of directors. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s annual meeting is scheduled for Thursday, although most business will be conducted at a reconvened meeting on Saturday to give shareholders time to digest the BCI offer, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> over the past seven months repeatedly has spurned <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover proposals, maintaining it wanted to remain independent but recently disclosing it was seeking a `` white knight'' friendly merger partner as an alternative. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said his company would to study the <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> offer, but it felt its own bid was superior. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> also said the foreign offer for <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> could run into problems gaining regulatory approval from the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, contending <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> might have problems meeting capital adequacy requirements. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, a banking analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> could sweeten its current offer, but it would have to resubmit to the lengthy regulatory process that includes hearings before the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> boards. Analysts said they were n't surprised <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> sought help from a foreign bank, because many large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks lack the capital for big acquisitions. But some experts said they found the complexity of the deal may have accounted for the relatively lackluster activity in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> stock. Irving shares rose slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Monday before declining to close $ 1 lower at $ 60.37 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> shares gained $ 1 to $ 31.65 -LCB-. As part of its restructuring <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said it would enact a hiring freeze as part of an intensive cost saving program. The program could raise net income to about $ 1.60 a share in 1988 and $ 2.75 next year. In addition, the company said said it immediately would increase its annual common dividend from $ 2.42 a share to $ 4.50. To pay for the special $ 10-a-share dividend, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said it planned to sell its Wall Street headquarters and its 39 percent equity interest in <LOCATION> Banca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> della </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Svizzera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Italiana </LOCATION> for more than the current market price of about $ 325 million. <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, has assets of about $ 60 billion and is <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second largest bank, behind <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nazionale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lavoro </ORGANIZATION>. About 64 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> is owned by the giant state holding company <ORGANIZATION> Istituto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> per </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ricostruzione </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industriale </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s assets total $ 24.12 billion. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> lost $ 193.27 million last year, after raising its loan-loss reserves to cover troubled Third World debt.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> will have a chance on Wednesday to convince <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's shareholders that the company remains on track in spite of the death from cancer of Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s death on Monday at age 62 came just two days before the company's annual shareholders' meeting in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. It shocked the company, coming just one month after the vigorous, tough-talking executive was reported ill with flu. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, 53, who will field questions at the annual meeting, is the president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and is serving as acting chairman Analysts say <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was being groomed to succeed <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> as chairman, although no one expected the transition to come so quickly. He is the odds-on favorite to be named chairman by the board of directors, which might make a decision this week. Like <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> rose in <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T through the local telephone operating companies that once belonged to the Bell System. He also is a career <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T executive. But in contrast to the blunt, gregarious <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> is described as quiet and thoughtful, though determined. `` He's a very bright and very direct kind of guy and very low-key. If you lived in a nice neighborhood, he'd be one of the nicer neighbors,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, senior analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Probe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knolls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> became AT & amp; T chairman in September 1986, when the company still was adrift after the 1984 breakup of the Bell System. He cut costs, oversaw the painful cutting of 27,000 jobs and gave the company a sense of direction. `` <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> was the one guy who was hard-nosed enough that he would push and get his way, and drive people who may not feel the same pressure under the new chairman,'' said <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. In contrast to <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, whose first job with <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T was cleaning silt out of manholes in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> in 1943, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> started out in management at <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> after his graduation from <ORGANIZATION> Wabash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> worked his way up through <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Potomac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos </ORGANIZATION>. He was slated to become a president in Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> at the time of the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T breakup in 1984, but instead was called to serve as executive vice president and chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T in July 1983. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> took charge of corporate administration and finance in 1984 and was promoted to chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. He was named president and chief operating officer in 1986. In a sign of <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s standing, he shared the spotlight with <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> in the introduction to the company's latest annual report, which featured a question-and-answer session with the two executives. Here are some of the problems <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T will have to face with <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> gone: _ Morale, though somewhat improved, still leaves room for improvement, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's own surveys have found _ The company's computer business continues losing money and may not become profitable until 1990 Some analysts say the company needs to buy an established computer maker. _ Shareholders are agitating for an increase in the quarterly dividend, which has been $ 1.20 a share since the breakup _ <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> still gets 91 percent of its revenue in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is having a hard time cracking foreign markets, a company goal since the early 1980s Analysts differed on how significant <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s loss would be. `` In a lot of ways, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> is an unknown quantity. My sense is he does not have the kind of following <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> had. But he has not been in a position where he could get those loyalties,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, executive editor of Wiretap newsletter in <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` What he -LRB- <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> -RRB- forged together may start to slip apart a little bit,'' said <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Grubman </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> is <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s hand-picked successor.

<HEAD>Armstrong Sale To Lead Armtek In Search Of More Automotive-related
Businesses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it will be looking to acquire additional automotive-related businesses once it completes the sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Armtek announced Monday it had agreed to sell <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> Tire to <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest tiremakers, for $ 190 million cash. Armtek will use most if not all of the proceeds to reduce its long-term debt, which stood at about $ 300 million the end of the first quarter, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sievers </PERSON>, director of corporate planning and investor relations. <PERSON> Armtek </PERSON> also will seek additional acquisitions to pursue its goal of becoming a leading worldwide supplier of materials, components and systems to automotive and industrial markets, company officials said. `` We will not stray at all from our automotive focus,'' <PERSON> Sievers </PERSON> said. Armtek is the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Dayco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a supplier of engineered drive systems, including automotive and industrial belts and hoses; <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of heat exchange systems and components, and <ORGANIZATION> Copolymer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a producer of specialty polymers. <PERSON> Sievers </PERSON> said growth prospects were good for all three companies. Armstrong Tire, founded 75 years ago, employs about 2,700 people. The company supplies the majority of all passenger and light-truck radial tires sold by <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, its largest customer for more than 50 years. It is also a leading supplier of farm tires. <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> had sought last year to acquire 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION>, but talks ended because the companies could not agree on the value of the proposed buyout, Armtek officials said. This time, <PERSON> Armtek </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> signed an agreement for the sale of 100 percent of Armstrong Tire. <PERSON> Ludovico </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandi </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide tire operation, said <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> would benefit from <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION>'s `` excellent aftermarket distribution and efficient production facilities.'' The transaction is subject to approval by <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION>'s board, which meets today and Wednesday, and is expected to close by May 31. <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, recently lost out to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a bidding war for <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> will be acquiring three <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> tire manufacturing plants in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and its tire chord and fabric manufacturing facility in <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> N.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> is not selling its tube plant in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, although <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> has expressed interest in acquiring it later, <PERSON> Sievers </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> has agreed, as part of the sale, to purchase raw materials from <ORGANIZATION> Copolymer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> on a long-term basis, <PERSON> Sievers </PERSON> said. The sale of <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> follows a general trend of consolidation in the tire industry brought on by the widespread use of radial tires, which do not need to be replaced frequently. Buffeted by both domestic and foreign competition, <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION> had been reducing its reliance on the tire business in recent years. In 1980, 90 percent of the revenue of <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, now known as <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION>, came from the tire business. By the end of the 1987 fiscal year, that segment accounted for only 38 percent of its $ 1.2 billion in revenue. About 300 people are employed as corporate staff for <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters here. <PERSON> Sievers </PERSON> said the sale was not expected to change the management structure significantly.

<HEAD>Report: Enhanced Oil Recovery Projects Down 28 Percent in Two
Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of enhanced oil recovery projects operating in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fell by 28 percent over the past two years due to the sliding price of crude oil, according to an industry magazine. The projects, which are aimed at boosting oil recovery from known reservoirs, suffered from crude prices that were too low to provide incentives for expansion and from a lack of capital to invest in new projects, the Oil and <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Monday issue. The Journal's report came as about 1,000 industry representatives attended a three-day symposium on enhanced oil recovery methods beginning here on Monday. Oil prices, which remain in the $ 18-a-barrel range, are forcing larger American producers away from high-cost enhanced oil recovery methods and into areas with quicker payoffs, said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> symposium and head of research for <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> facility. A Journal survey indicated 366 active <ORGANIZATION> EOR </ORGANIZATION> projects in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, compared with 512 projects at the same time two years ago. Over the same period, production from enhanced recovery operations increased slightly to 637,000 barrels of oil a day. Enhanced oil recovery techniques include the the injection of steam, gases or liquids into oil-producing formations. Thermal recovery methods, mostly steam injection, account for about 73 percent of the additional production resulting from <ORGANIZATION> EOR </ORGANIZATION> operations, the Journal said. Some $ 960 million will be spent on enhanced recovery projects planned for 1988 and 1989 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere, based on investment information for 76 projects during that period, the magazine stated.

 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NH </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest bank holding company, has signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ireland </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 370 million. The $ 30.50 a share buyout proposal announced Monday, which is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies and banking regulators, comes as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> is about to relax its restrictions on interstate banking. First NH stock rose $ 1.50 to $ 27 a share Monday in national over-the-counter trading. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwedhelm </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NH </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>, said the bank would retain its name and current management under the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ireland </ORGANIZATION> proposal. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ireland </ORGANIZATION> has assets of about $ 15 billion while <ORGANIZATION> NH </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> has $ 2.5 billion in assets. Banking analysts said they considered <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NH </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> a prime takeover target following a revised banking bill expected to be signed into law this month by Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. Enactment of the banking bill is expected to spark an avalanche of negotiations for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> banks, which no out-of-state bank seriously pursued under the interstate banking law passed last year. `` The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> economy is strong; they have good tax laws and a low unemployment rate ... It's a state that most bankers are envious about and want to get into,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, a bank analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Advest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Under existing law, regional banks merging with or acquiring a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> bank must have all their deposits within <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. They are prohibited from acquiring banks outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> once they buy <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> institutions. The pending revision means an acquiring bank need have only 51 percent of its deposits in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on the day it applies for state approval of a purchase. The revised measure also loosens restrictions on doing business with banks outside of the region.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said today he is `` delighted that there is a consensus that change is needed'' in the nation's air safety system. `` It's not a matter of unsafe or safe, or that something is wrong; its just that improvement is necessary, improvement is required,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. His comments came a day after a presidential commission said that the government should step up its inspection of the nation's airlines if safety is to be maintained, and should establish a `` permanent program of in-depth'' examinations of air carriers The findings were released as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> continued its detailed inspection of two of the country's largest airlines, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, and a staged a broad review of safety among the country's commuter airlines. The presidential panel called on the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to hire additional inspectors, stage more frequent surprise inspections and give priority to airlines undergoing major changes. `` These changes to the inspection program are critical to maintaining safety,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Albertine </PERSON>, chairman of the President's Commission on Aviation Safety. <PERSON> Albertine </PERSON>, also appearing on `` Today,'' commented that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is falling behind in the area of technology because of federal regulations relating to procurement. In addition, the agency is hampered by civil service hiring rules, <PERSON> Albertine </PERSON> said. He said he would hope a new, independent agency, could set its own, more flexible, hiring and procurement practices. Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, during an appearance on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Good Morning America, termed the idea of surprise inspections a good one The current safety system is basically sound, <PERSON> Moninari </PERSON> said, there just are n't enough air traffic controllers, maintenance technicians and safety inspectors. More of those people are needed, he said. Last year the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> had just over 2,000 inspectors, an increase of about 500 over the last five years, the commission said. The panel released its report after a nine-month study of airline safety and recommended: _ The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> be separated from the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> under an independent authority funded through aviation taxes _ Creation of a top-ranking official in the new <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> who would assume the job of `` aviation safety czar'' and have broad regulatory powers _ Safety requirements for commuter airlines be gradually tightened to put them on the same level as the major air carriers _ Requiring small, private planes flying near `` hub'' airports to have equipment that tells controllers altitude information The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> already has proposed regulations that would require such equipment on an even broader scale. The commission concluded that while commercial aviation remains safe, the government may lose its ability to keep the skies safe without `` major structural overhaul'' of the way the airline industry is regulated. `` The nation's air transportation system is safe, for now,'' said <PERSON> Albertine </PERSON>. `` However, that safety is being maintained to an increasing extent through delays and through what I can only characterize as heroic efforts of air traffic controllers, airways facilities technicians, safety inspectors and other <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> personnel.'' The commission rejected suggestions by some industry groups that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> be taken out of the government and be made a semi-private agency. It also said it was not in favor of spinning off air traffic control functions into a private function as has been suggested by <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON>. `` The regulatory process must remain governmental in character and not be taken out of the federal government or removed from public accountability,'' said <PERSON> Albertine </PERSON>. Initial reaction to the report was favorable, although both industry and congressional sources expressed skepticism that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would go along with creation of an `` aviation safety czar.'' Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on aviation, said the commission's proposal to remove the agency from the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is a `` much-needed change. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is sponsoring a bill that would make the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> an independent agency, a proposal endorsed Monday by several industry organizations. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asociation </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the nation's airlines, said reorganization of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> `` is the only way to solve'' personnel, purchasing and other problems. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, a safety official of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, national coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the commission's findings are likely to give a boost to legislation calling for an independent <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> within the government <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> secretary, has not endorsed an independent <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> although he favors turning air traffic control functions over to a private entity. Recently <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, expressed concern about the influence the airlines might have over an independent <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm concerned that the aviation industry is trying to get an independent <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> because it is easier for them to dominate an independent <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. The seven members of the commission created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were appointed last year by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. They concluded that the 1978 deregulation of the airline industry has not eroded safety, as some critics have contended. While the number of airline passengers has grown from about 250 million in 1978 to 450 million last year, the numbers of accidents, fatalities and injuries have all decreased, the report said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> continues defending its controversial role in the hostile $ 1.7 billion takeover bid being waged for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> says its first quarter net loss stemmed partly from expenses in defending against the bid. The group led by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> on Monday extended its stalled $ 60 a share tender offer through midnight EDT Friday. The one-week extension had been expected following a federal judge's ruling last Friday that indefinitely blocked the bid because of apparent securities law violations. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 37 -LCB- cents to $ 53.25 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading on Monday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who issued the injunction blocking the tender offer, has said the takeover was the first known instance of an investment bank being the outright owner of a takeover vehicle. He also has called <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> a `` major equity participant'' in the deal and said that although the firm had only limited voting rights in the company created to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> it was one of the entities on whose behalf the hostile bid was made. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of the investment bank, told reporters on Monday that the firm's role in the takeover attempt was not unusual or out of line. <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company formed by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 23 million for a 46 percent interest in BNS, which compares with the 49 percent interest worth $ 24.5 million held by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>, chairman of the British construction and building materials company bearing his name. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> executives said the firm does n't hold real equity because it can force <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> to buy its share within five years and <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> can force <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> to sell through a `` call.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said equity `` is something that's got a continuous life, and ours does n't.'' For several years takeover lenders have been accepting warrants, or the right to purchase stock at a specified price, `` and warrants ... the last time I looked -LRB- were -RRB- characterized as an equity security,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. Shearson probably will make less than $ 30 million on its equity in BNS, he said, declining to say what <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> stands to make in fees. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> said it spent at least $ 3.5 million in the first quarter to resist the hostile bid, helping generate a quarterly net loss of $ 8.5 million. The company posted a $ 3 million net loss in first quarter 1987. At least half of the additional $ 7 million <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> incurred in first-quarter overhead was in fees for attorneys, financial advisers and other defense costs, said company spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Gara </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Gara </PERSON> said he could not quantify the defense expenses beyond saying they were a majority of the $ 7 million. The tender offer was launched March 3, two-thirds of the way through the quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> said its first-quarter sales climbed 13 percent from $ 271.7 million to $ 306.7 million. The company's construction materials and services businesses had operating losses totaling $ 2.3 million, compared to losses of $ 4.1 million a year earlier. Operating earnings in chemicals and related products climbed to $ 8.6 million from $ 6.4 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has become the first company to announce it has developed personal computers based on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s patented Personal System-2 design. The Dell System 400 and System 500 are expected to be available for sale in the final three months of 1988 and should cost about 30 percent less than comparable <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> models, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dell </PERSON>, the company's 23-year-old founder and chief executive, announced Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> said it expects to complete a patent licensing agreement with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> `` in the very near future.'' <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mihalec </PERSON> said the company could not confirm talks with particular companies, but reaffirmed that the company is willing to provide licenses on its patents under reasonable terms and conditions. However, <PERSON> Mihalec </PERSON> said a patent license does not protect a company if it happens to infringe on features of the Personal System-2 and its Micro Channel Architecture that are protected in other ways, such as by copyrights. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s Micro Channel Architecture has been touted by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> as a way to improve the performance of personal computers when they are linked together in networks. It also allows the machine to perform more than one major task at a time. But industry analysts say the new Personal System-2 computers still lack the software and additional features to take full advantage of the new design. They say machines with conventional designs offer higher performance for less cost. <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> reported sales of $ 159 million and earnings of $ 9.4 million for its last fiscal year ended Jan. 31. It has grown to the country's seventh largest maker of personal computers since being founded in 1984 with a $ 1,000 investment.

 Attention shoppers, it's time for a quick quiz. A customer goes into a large discount store hoping to save a bundle on running shoes. He finds that the prices are indeed slashed, but there are eight different kinds to choose from. What should he do? A. Buy the pair that looks the most sophisticated. B. Try to find a sales clerk who may know slightly more than him about running shoes. C. Leave the store confused. D. All of the above. Consumers across the country, whether they're shopping for shoes or kitchen appliances, are coming up with all of those and other equally unfulfilling answers. `` You almost have to know everything there is to know about a product before you go into a store,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiernan </PERSON>, executive director of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Consumer frustration is one reason a tiny Rochester-based computer company has introduced a curious new machine into supermarkets around the country to help the confused, the tired and the busy shopper. Inter-Ad, a private firm, sells computers that can be used to give directions in the store, to print out recipes or coupons or to offer food preparation instruction, all with a touch of a finger. `` We've seen a trend away from the traditional homemaker to two-career families and these are people who have less time to shop,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizesko </PERSON>, Inter-Ad's director of marketing. `` Convenience has become more important than price now and these machines are part of that.'' These machines and others like them may be the answer of the future for the baffled consumer, according to two <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> professors, who are doing research in the `` consumer computer'' field. Having computers as sales people is something that has attracted the attention of many large companies, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. The idea, they say, is to program computers to analyze various consumer decisions _ like `` What kind of motor oil do I need?'' or `` How much will these denim jeans stretch?'' _ and provide some guidance. The professors say these so-called `` expert systems'' are going to be popping up in all kinds of stores over the next five years. `` People are getting tired of hearing ` I do n't know, I just work here.' They do n't want to be at the mercy of that kind of salesperson,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. The two researchers are putting the finishing touches on a system to help people choose a personal computer. They also have a program on the drawing board to offer advice on running shoes. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said he hopes to set up his `` expert computer consultant'' in the school bookstore by the end of the summer and see how it fares. Eventually, he would like to put it in computer stores around the country. The idea of using computers to analyze problems and offer advice is not new, but so far they have been used mostly in industrial or scientific applications. The first system, created in the early 70s, was called <LOCATION> Mycin </LOCATION> and it served the medical profession offering diagnoses of various bacterial blood infections, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said. The only problem was that it took a whole day to get one diagnosis. Since then, however, expert systems have been greatly improved and are used to diagnose problems in auto engines, to predict where veins of valuable mineral deposits are, and to offer advice to oil drillers. `` The time has come to make the jump to the consumer,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. Inter-Ad has machines in several hundred stores in 75 different supermarket chains in 32 states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The store directory is the most popular model, with a cuisine machine, which offers videos of how to carve a turkey or clean a fish, found in about half as many stores. Last year, Inter-Ad introduced `` The Information Station'' which combines the two machines and also prints coupons and can be used for in-store advertising. That system is being tested by the Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is using it in seven stores. Other chains are also using the system, <PERSON> Mizesko </PERSON> said. The machines cost from $ 7,000 to $ 12,000, he said. Eventually, the 6-year-old Inter-Ad company that President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Odorczyk </PERSON> started in his home after resigning from <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> hopes to use its video kiosks to serve as a national in-store advertising network. <PERSON> Tiernan </PERSON>, the consumer advocate, warned that the potential use of these `` expert systems'' as advertising vehicles is the biggest drawback they have, although he estimated that overall they would be a service rather than a sales gimmick for shoppers. `` But you still have to remember if the store manager says he's got an extra shipment of basil he needs to sell, you might see a whole lot of recipes calling for fresh basil,'' <PERSON> Tiernan </PERSON> said

<TEXT>
 Officials of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> announced today that the company's tender offer for debt holders to submit their securities was successful, paving the way for a $ 1.6 billion federal bailout plan. Last month, the company _ which officially becomes the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> under the plan _ lowered the required participation level from 90 percent to 70 percent. In making today's announcement, however, company officials declined to confirm that senior and subordinated debt holders had surrendered 70 percent of the bank holding company's debt. <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> officials announced last week they planned to complete the deal by today. A Monday afternoon deadline, the company's sixth, passed without word from <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on whether the company had completed the last obstacle to finish the reorganization plan. As of last week, 66.1 percent, or $ 149.3 million, of the bank's $ 225.8 million in bonds had been tendered First City needs at least $ 158 million of the outstanding debt tendered to complete the deal. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>'s effort to rescue Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> with the help of $ 970 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been slowed by bondholders' reluctance to part with the debt First City senior debt holders have been offered 45 cents on the dollar for their debt, while subordinated debt holders have been offered 35 cents. Bonds not tendered by the deadline become the obligation of the revitalized <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and would be worth more than what <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> is offering. The bailout plan, announced in September, calls for $ 970 million in assistance from the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, a spinoff of $ 1.79 billion in book value of poorly performing assets and $ 500 million infusion of capital raised privately by a group headed by <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>. Also on Monday, <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> has agreed to put up more than $ 500 million in private money through new stock underwritten by <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The report said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has pledged $ 100 million _ under certain conditions _ as part of that sum. A First City spokesman said he was not aware of <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>'s involvment with <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>. Calls to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment company from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> were not returned. <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, with 59 banks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, grew quickly during the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil boom, but was hit by energy and real estate losses when oil prices plummeted. For 1987, the state's fourth-largest bank holding company posted a $ 1.1 billion loss. In a 10K report filed late last month with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> reported it expected to lose $ 43 million by the time the reorganization is completed. If the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> does n't redeem enough bonds, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> says it will resort to an alternative that will hurt bondholders more than <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>'s proposal. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> wo n't say what the alternatives are, but analysts suspect the agency would declare <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> insolvent, seize it under its emergency powers and then turn it over to <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>. If that happens, bondholders would get wiped out. Another alternative would be to declare First City bankrupt and negotiate with bondholders in court.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Narrowly Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices opened narrowly mixed today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Soybean futures showed no clear trend either higher or lower. Higher soybean oil prices provided some impetus on the positive side, but lower values for soybean meal exerted downward pressure. Soybean traders have been keeping a close watch on the Brazilian soybean harvest, which was reportedly about 55 percent complete as of last Friday, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` That's compared to 45 percent last year and a normal of 50 percent, so it's proceeding about on average,'' he said. Corn and wheat prices were nearly unchanged in early trading. Some observers had expected wheat prices to fall in reaction to sluggish export sales and the government's auction sale last Friday of 11.2 million bushels of surplus wheat. In early trading, wheat was unchanged to -RCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.11 -LCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to \ cent higher with May at $ 2.03 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1 \ cents higher with May at $ 1.65 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were -RCB- cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with May at $ 6.65 -RCB- a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .05 cent to .60 cent higher with April at 74.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .50 cent higher with April at 79.30 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .40 cent higher with April at 44.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .50 cent higher with May at 52.15 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures closed mostly lower on Monday.

 Oil futures prices dropped sharply today, as profit-taking continued in the wake of the runup that erupted on Monday's explosion of U.S.-Iran fighting in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. In midday trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, stood at $ 18.12 per 42-gallon barrel, down 15 cents from Monday's closing price. May contracts for wholesale unleaded gasoline were trading at 52.40 cents per gallon, down 0.90 cent, while wholesale heating oil contracts were down 0.85 cent at 49.65 cents per gallon. Analysts said selling hit the market from the start, continuing a trend that began early Monday afternoon. Anticipating that diminished <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> oil supplies might send prices higher, many traders rushed to buy Monday despite widespread realization that any shortfall could easily be diminished by other world producers, analysts said. As a result, when the initial excitement died down, prices slipped back because of profit-taking and technical factors, they said. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels destroyed two offshore Iranian oil platforms, sank a defending Iranian patrol boat and bombed two Iranian navy frigates in retaliation for a mine attack that nearly sank a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessel. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attacked oil facilities off <LOCATION> Sharjah </LOCATION> and fired on at least two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessels. <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, an analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> investment firm, said prices soared on those reports, even though `` there's an overall recognition that if you shut down the Gulf, there's not so big an impact'' on world oil supplies, because of the number of other producers has grown. But the markets still worry to the point that `` anything that happens in that area has got to have an impact on prices,'' she added. Ms. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said the failure of the May crude contract to move above $ 19 discouraged traders, who then began the afternoon selloff. The May crude contract expires at Wednesday's close, and so `` a lot of people took advantage of the higher prices and sold off,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKiernan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> McKiernan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> commodities trading firm.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the tobacco, food and brewing giant, said Tuesday its first-quarter profit rose 30.1 percent on a 10.4 percent increase in revenue. The company makes Marlboro cigarettes, Jell-O pudding, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> meats, <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> coffee and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> beers. It also has a financial services unit. The company said its profit rose to $ 502 million, or $ 2.12 a share, in the three months ended March 31, up from $ 386 million, or $ 1.62 a share, a year earlier. Operating revenue rose to $ 7.24 billion in the quarter from $ 6.55 billion a year earlier. Chairman <PERSON> Hamish </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said the company's domestic cigarette operations had higher operating revenue on higher cigarette unit volume despite an industrywide volume decline in the quarter. Internationally, operating revenue and volume of cigarettes were up strongly for the period, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> division reported higher unit volume in the quarter, while operating revenue was flat due to a decline in the domestic coffee business. Domestic results of the division were helped by gains in baked goods and the introduction of new Jell-O ready-to-eat puddings. The <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> operations posted strong volume gains and slight revenue increases for the quarter as the brand increased its market share in hot dogs, bacon and sliced luncheon meats, the statement said. The <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> operation reported that higher barrel volume and price increases led to higher operating revenue for the quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> posted higher revenue as well, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Harvey Mackay Shows How to Swim with the Sharks and Survive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At age 26, on his way to becoming a best-selling author, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> bought a failing envelope company with 12 employees, annual sales of $ 200,000 and a few pieces of broken-down equipment. He did n't change the company's name to <ORGANIZATION> Mackay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Envelope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for 2 -LCB- years, he says, `` because I did n't want the <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> name on it if I went bankrupt.'' Today that company has 350 employees, sales of approximately $ 35 million and modern plants in both <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and for the past 10 years <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> has traveled around the world giving seminars for other businesses. Now the 55-year-old <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> businessman has written a book outlining his philosophy on how to become successful and the insights he's gleaned from his experiences. `` Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive'' was published March 23. By mid-April, 150,000 copies had been sold, the book was on back order and was No. 2 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> best-seller list in the `` how-to'' category. The book's success was no accident. `` I traveled around the country visiting bookstores and talking with people in the industry'' before starting to write the book two years ago, <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> said. His research showed many books fail because they are n't available in the bookstores So when he went to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> & amp; Co.. Inc. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to talk about a contract, he asked for a first printing of 100,000 copies `` I'm an unknown, first-time author from the flyover state of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. I wanted to make sure there were enough,'' he remembers with the dry wit characteristic of the book. But <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> also was prepared to show <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> officials how he could help them. `` I told them I knew about 2,000 presidents and chief executive officers of major companies throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and said I would mail the book to those people,'' <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> said. `` They had to know I had made a personal commitment to help them market the book,'' he said. <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> told them he was willing to take time off from his business for an extended book tour and said he would put on a two-hour seminar for the company's sales force. During the seminar, `` I would not talk about my book,'' he said. But the presentation meant the sales force would know <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON>, and those same sales people would then be selling his book to the bookstores. `` It was a two-way street _ good for them and a big break for me,'' he said. When the contract was written, <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> had a $ 150,000 budget for promotion, a six-figure advance -LRB- he wo n't disclose the exact amount -RRB- and a 100,000 first printing. After he began writing, <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> was invited to bring his manuscript and address a publishing course at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. One of the professors made his first draft mandatory reading for the class, <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> said, giving him free feedback from the 85 students. Once the manuscript was completed, <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> sent copies to nearly 50 well-known friends asking them to read it and drop him a line telling him what they thought. `` I was hoping for three or four responses,'' <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> said. Forty-five responded _ including former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, newsman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON>, feminist <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinem </PERSON>, Notre Dame football Coach <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtz </PERSON>, actors <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, advice columnist <PERSON> Abigail </PERSON> -LRB- Dear Abby -RRB- <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, Baseball Commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> and evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. Their praises of `` Swim With the Sharks'' are printed on the first 15 pages before the title page. `` The book is about preparing to win, preparing to be successful, changing the probability, leveling the playing field so you have the highest probability going for you to succeed,'' <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> said. `` There are all kinds of people who are really trying but are spinning their wheels.'' However, he stresses the difference between being successful and getting rich. `` I believe a successful person is one who measures the standard of his or her own performance by their own potential,'' said <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON>, the top-ranked tennis player in his age group in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and a self-described `` language junkie'' who speaks Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. `` Measuring your success by the standards of others does n't work, he quips, because `` every time you catch up with the <PERSON> Joneses </PERSON>, they refinance. The cornerstone of the book is a 66-question customer profile which <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> developed for his own sales people to use to `` become a colleague of the people you're dealing with'' and to help make sales. The profile includes detailed information on the person's education, family and business background, special interests and lifestyle But <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> stressed that sincerity is important in dealing with people. `` You might fool someone in the short term, but not in the long term,'' he said. The book, now in its seventh printing, was written primarily to help people, but also as a legacy for his three grown children, said <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON>, whose wife, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, has been accompanying him on the book tour. `` There is no greater reward in life than to be able to help another human being. Period. That's what turns me on,'' he said. While <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> had the money and the connections to promote his book, he says it is n't necessary to have money to make money. `` You can take my money, put me in <LOCATION> Tucumcari </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, with nothing, and I can do it again,'' <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> said. `` Anyone can do it if they want to do it.''

<HEAD>Inflation Hits New High In First Quarter Of 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Retail prices rose faster than average incomes in some cities in the first quarter of 1988 and the nationwide inflation rate hit 11 percent, the government announced Tuesday. The inflation rate, up from a national average of 7.3 percent in 1987, is the highest the government has reported since senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> began reducing central planning and price controls in favor of market reforms in 1978. In 32 large and medium-size cities, retail prices rose 13.4 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said, while average per capita incomes in urban areas only rose 13 percent, to more than 90 yuan, or $ 24, per month. Average per capita income for rural residents rose 25 percent, to 50 yuan, or $ 13.50 per month. Top officials have acknowledged widespread popular discontent over the rising prices and have announced corrective measures. But they also have warned that inflation will remain high for several years as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> strives to develop its backward economy and allow market factors to set prices. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhongji </PERSON>, director of the statistic bureau's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference that the industrial sector maintained its rapid growth in the first quarter, with output up 16.7 percent from the same period last year, to the equivalent of $ 71.5 billion. Industrial output grew 16.5 percent during all of 1987. Vice Premier <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, told a recent news conference that the government's goal was to keep inflation below 10 percent, but added: `` Whether we will be able to achieve it I ca n't tell you.'' His cautious assessment reflected the difficulty of the government's task: to cool demand that is pushing prices up without curbing much-needed economic growth. Uncontrolled investment in often irrational and competing projects and inadequate supplies of such goods as televisions and refrigerators have contributed to inflation. The government has blamed inadquate investment in agriculture for high food prices and short supplies of meat in the cities. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said grain production was expected to remain about the same as last year, or 400 million tons. Despite repeated calls to stress grain production, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been unable to repeat its record 1984 harvest of 407 million tons.

<HEAD>Alcoa Earnings Nearly Quadruple</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Alumunum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> said Tuesday that high demand for the lightweight metal and strong revenues worldwide helped to nearly quadruple first-quarter earnings to $ 178.7 million, or $ 2.02 per share. `` <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION>'s fundamentals remain strong worldwide,'' said Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>. `` Customers do not appear to be building inventory. The January price increase in aluminum beverage can sheet, <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION>'s largest volume product, is holding. He said the company expects favorable market conditions and operating fundamentals to continue. The nation's largest aluminum producer reported 1987 first-quarter net earnings of $ 49.5 million, or 56 cents per share. Sales increased 18 percent to $ 2.1 billion from $ 1.8 billion, and shipments rose 2 percent to 536,000 metric tons from 527,000 metric tons. The quarter was supported by price increases on most products and more efficient production rates, although the costs of purchased metal, particularly used aluminum beverage cans, are rising, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` With higher prices for ingot and alumina, earnings for <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Alcoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aluminio </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> accounted for 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter earnings in spite of currency losses of $ 18.5 million from these two companies,'' he said. Alumina is an intermediary form of aluminum during the refining and smelting processes. Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> operates 97 facilities around the world, employing about 55,000 workers.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently pressured <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials to allow companies to avoid the expense of ventilating toxic gases from the workplace by making workers wear less effective, but cheaper, respirators instead, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee was told today. As a result, proposed standards are being prepared for White House approval that would allow greater use of personal respirators for short-term exposure to toxic substances or when the cost of a cleanup is considered `` excessive,'' scientists with the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> testified. The changes were first advocated five years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Regulatory Relief chaired by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and were pushed by the vice president in a meeting last month with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the scientists said. Dr. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, deputy director of health standards for <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Martonik </PERSON>, the agency's director of standards analysis, said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> had effectively resisted the idea until January. `` There is no way in my view that respirators can be as protective,'' <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Martonik </PERSON> agreed with that assessment but said the proposed regulations, nontheless, were sent to the White House with the changes called for by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s task force. `` It was a waste of our time as far as I ` m concerned,'' <PERSON> Martonik </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We had to tie up five years working on this.'' The committee was told Monday that between 50,000 and 70,000 Americans are dying from occupational illnesses each year because the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has delayed new job health regulations and has not enforced existing standards. Dr. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Landrigan </PERSON>, director of environmental and occupational medicine at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, offered those statistics Monday and estimated another 350,000 workers incur illnesses each year because of inaction by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, former director of safety research at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said 2,000 workers have been killed in so-called `` confined space'' accidents alone since 1980, when government safety officials first proposed a regulation to address the problem. `` The proposed standard has never left the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which opened three days of hearings into what Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> called `` the fiddling away of workers' lives'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The confined space regulation recommended by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> safety experts in 1980 was intended to address the high incidence of workers who are electrocuted or otherwise killed or injured because there is not enough room to maneuver around dangerous equipment. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., vowed to develop a hearing record this week showing that `` the decision to let workers die while waiting on a standard or an inspection has been carried out by the highest levels of this administration. Assistant Labor Secretary and <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> is scheduled to testify Wednesday before the panel, which has had its staff investigating the agency for more than a year. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, called the figures of <PERSON> Landrigan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> `` amazing numbers'' and said agency officials would have no further comment until they appear before <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s committee on Wednesday <PERSON> Landrigan </PERSON> testified Monday that occupational exposures to toxic substances _ `` almost all of them arising out of manmade conditions and therefore preventable'' _ are raising mortality rates for certain forms of cancer. As an example, he said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision not to reduce allowable exposures to benzene until 1987 will result in 19 to 65 leukemia deaths that otherwise would not occur. He said the agency had the scientific evidence in 1981 to justify the reduction. Another seven to 48 workers will develop cancer and at least 5,900 more will contract respiratory ailments because <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> delayed for five years recommended reductions in formaldehyde exposures, <PERSON> Landrigan </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> received $ 17.9 million in 1987, most of it by cashing in on stock options that were granted when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> was in financial trouble, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> reported in its proxy statement Tuesday <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> was the nation's highest-paid executive in 1986. The proxy, which was mailed Tuesday to shareholders, said $ 13.5 million of <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s 1987 earnings came when he cashed in stock options he was granted early in the decade when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> stock was worth a fraction of its present value. He also received a $ 766,000 salary, $ 725,000 in a cash bonus, $ 248,990 in a stock bonus and a stock grant worth $ 2.7 million. In 1986, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> earned $ 20.6 million, including $ 9.6 million in exercised stock options and nearly $ 1 million in cash bonuses. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 executive, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s automaking business, earned nearly $ 6.6 million in 1987. That included $ 5.3 million in exercised stock options. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> scheduled a news conference for later Tuesday, at which union Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> was expected to blast <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> for paying such high salaries and bonuses to executives.

 <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a bottling company spawned by the <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday its profit rose 82.2 percent in the first quarter of 1988. The company cited increased volume, improved operating efficiencies and the inclusion of bottling company acquisitions completed in the latter half of 1987 and the first quarter as well as certain tax regulations for the improvement.

 <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s, the world's largest art auctioneer, said Tuesday its shareholders would sell to the public fewer shares at a cheaper price than previously planned, apparently because of the volatile stock markets. The shareholders will raise a maximum of $ 116 million _ compared with the earlier planned $ 187 million _ through the first public sale of <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, the closely held company said. <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, declined to provide a reason for the substantial trimming down of the sale. However, the sale originally had been planned for October but was postponed because of the stock markets' crash. <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s said the shareholders would sell 5.5 million shares at between $ 18 a share and $ 21 a share, raising a total of between $ 99 million and $ 116 million. The stock being sold will represent 22 percent of the company's stock, it said <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s previously had said that 7.21 million shares would be sold at between $ 23 a share and $ 26 a share for a total of between $ 166 million and $ 187 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has acquired <ORGANIZATION> Childcraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 52 million, a move that will significantly expand <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s mail-order business. Disney also said it plans to add 10 <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> stores to the corporation's fledgling retail operation. Disney currently operates three stores that are not on amusement-park grounds, all in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer products division. <ORGANIZATION> Childcraft </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, was a good fit because its target market is preschoolers who are loyal fans of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Duck </PERSON> and other characters from the Disney menagerie, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Childcraft </ORGANIZATION>'s mailing list also will help bolster <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s mail-order business Last year, 2.8 million copies of the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catalog </ORGANIZATION> were mailed. This year, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> plans to mail 8 million copies, a spokesman said. The combined moves will expand by one-third <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s smallest division, consumer products, which licenses <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> characters and runs retail operations. In 1987, the consumer products division reported earnings of $ 167 million, about 6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 2.9 billion in 1987 revenue. Last year <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> reported $ 97 million in operating income. `` These are two further steps in the growth of the division,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said.

In the past seven months, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s retailing and licensing division also struck a 10-year deal with <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest retailer, to develop and sell new products.

 Share prices closed higher Tuesday in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, boosted by a strong performance in early trading in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished up 11.1 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,798.9. The index had declined as much as 3 points in lackluster early morning trading. Volume was light at 419.4 million shares, down slightly from 423.7 million on Monday. Shares traded in a narrow range throughout the morning amid a lack of fresh market-moving news and uncertainty about whether the British pound would continue its recent rise. But investors snapped out of their lethargy once Wall Street opened strongly higher. A slight rise in the dollar and a drop in the pound also buoyed sentiment, dealers said. `` There was n't much business, but what little there was was quality,'' one dealer said. Institutional buyers went after the major stocks, including shares of big pharmaceutical and electrical companies, he said.

 Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and grains followed suit, reflecting concern that supply problems may surface next fall. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report on spring planting intentions is now nearly three weeks old but continues to have an impact on the market, especially on soybean prices, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The report indicated that soybean acreage would increase this year by about 1 percent. Analysts said that with only a slight increase in acreage, weather conditions could play an unusually large role in the size of the harvest. The corn market faces a similar scenario, and early signs of dryness in the western corn belt may have touched off some buying interest Tuesday, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said. `` It's certainly much too early to be too concerned about weather,'' he said. `` But since it looks like the overall acreage base is going to be small this year, the market may be more sensitive to early weather problems.'' At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.14 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 3 cents higher with May at $ 2.05 \ a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 3 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 1.68 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 8 cents higher with May at $ 6.72 a bushel

<HEAD>DEC Unveils New Mid-Range VAX Computers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday unveiled a new mid-range computer line that analysts said was designed to head off expected product introductions by rival <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Digital officials said the new VAX 6200 series is designed to compete with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s existing 9370 and 4381 computers Digital, based in <LOCATION> Maynard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, is the world's second-largest computer company and considered the industry leader in mid-performance range computers. The announcement of the VAX 6200 series came one week after <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> reported a 0.8 percent decrease in profits for the latest quarter while <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> announced a 16.3 percent rise, reversing a two-year trend in the battle between the companies. The new computers, which will cost between $ 131,600 and $ 653,200, will be available immediately, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The new systems are positioned squarely in the middle of the VAX family and complement our current offerings,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demmer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of mid-range systems, said in a statement. Digital introduced several mainframe computers in its VAX 8800 series last month in a direct challenge to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. Last year the company unveiled its MicroVAX 3000 series designed for small departments. Analysts said the announcement was a strong tactical move for <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> because the company needed to upgrade its mid-range line before a rumored <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> development in the field. `` It's a good move for <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's partly intended to place them in a strongly competitive position when <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> announces its code-named Silverlake products this summer.'' `` DEC is getting their products out into the market first in order to prevent <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> from taking customers away,'' he said. The company said the single-processor 6210 computer provides 2.8 times the performance of its VAX 11 @ 780 system. The system can accommodate up to four processors at once. Upgrades will cost betweem $ 100,200 and $ 173,500, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings in its third fiscal quarter ending March 26 totaled $ 305.1 million, or $ 2.33 a share, down from $ 307.6 million, or $ 2.29 a share, one year earlier. The company had reduced its earnings estimates for the quarter because of sluggish sales of expensive computer systems and a shift in demand to smaller lines. Digital on Tuesday also announced a new version of its <ORGANIZATION> VMS </ORGANIZATION> software and a new FORTRAN version for symmetric multiprocessing. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday announced upgraded software to take advantage of design changes in its mainframe computers.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reported a 52 percent increase in first quarter earnings due to increased demand for its herbicide and other agricultural products. Net income for the three months ended March 31 was $ 210 million, or $ 2.86 a share, on revenue of $ 2.13 billion. That compared with a profit of $ 138 million, or $ 1.76 a share, and $ 1.87 billion in revenue last year. `` Strong demand for Roundup herbicide in new markets around the world was, once again, the major contributor to an excellent performance by agricultural products this quarter,'' <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. He said the quarterly results also were boosted by the increased sale of its Alimet animal feed supplement and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> approval of the use of Lasso <ORGANIZATION> MicroTech </ORGANIZATION> herbicide on corn. NutrSweet, Electronic Materials and Fsher Controls also showed improved sales and margins in the first quarter. Operating income for <ORGANIZATION> Fisher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controls </ORGANIZATION> declined, however, because of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs, <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced on Tuesday plans to pay more than $ 24 million in overdue preferred stock dividends and to sell 8 million shares of common stock to pare its $ 1.7 billion unfunded pension liability. One Wall Street analyst said the dividends are a sign of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s faith in the steel industry's recovery after five years of massive losses, plant closings and employment cuts. `` It shows more of a conviction that what is actually happening in the steel markets is going to be more sustainable than most observers believe,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Steel demand is strong, pricing is strong, earnings are going to be strong.'' The recovery seems `` very, very broad-based,'' he said. `` It represents the participation of the steel industry in the so-called reindustrialization of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said his enthusiasm for steel industry stocks, especially <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s, runs counter to the market. He called <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> stock undervalued. `` People are looking at the recoveries in the industrial and capital goods markets. They know it's happening, but they do n't believe it will continue,'' he said <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> reported profits in each quarter last year and $ 174 million profit for all of 1987. It was the first annual profit since 1981, and during the interim, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> lost more than $ 2 billion. The steelmaker said <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to underwrite the common stock offering, which follows last fall's sale of 12 million common shares and would raise the number of outstanding shares from the current 64.4 million to 72.4 million <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> stock fell $ 1.62 -LCB- per share to $ 19.37 -LCB- in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading after Tuesday's announcement. The company's board declared Monday that on June 10 shareholders of record May 10 will be paid arrearages and second quarter dividends of $ 6.25 per share and $ 3.12 -LCB- per share on <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s $ 5 and $ 2.50 cummulative convertible preferred issues respectively. Dividends worth $ 22.5 million were omitted for the second half of 1986 and the first half of 1987. The board also said the company will pay dividends June 11 on convertible preference shares issued to employees under contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> and other unions. The dividends will be paid in additional shares with an aggregate stated value of $ 1.7 million. The dividend covers the period ending April 1. The payments do not cover common stock dividends, which have not been paid since the board declared 10 cents per share for the third quarter of 1985. Unlike the preferred issues, on which dividends accumulate, the common issue does not require the company to pay a dividend. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> said it would report first quarter income at its annual shareholders meeting next Tuesday.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> may begin phasing out quotas on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citrus and beef imports as early as next week to avoid rebuke by an international panel, according to a top American trade official. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> vetoed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request two weeks ago for a special investigation of the quotas by the 92-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plans to push the issue at <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>'s next council meeting May 4. `` They know we will not allow a dispute panel to be blocked a second time,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative and ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> Monday.

<HEAD>Judge Declares Mexican Airline Bankrupt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge declared government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> bankrupt and ordered it into receivership, leaving the airline's more than 9,200 workers jobless Tuesday. The decision followed a strike by the airline's technical workers that shut down the airline on April 12 in protest of management plans to reduce the fleet and route system to bring <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> back into the black. The airline filed a petition for bankruptcy on Friday, saying it was losing $ 1 million a day because of the strike. Civil Court Judge <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Higuera </PERSON> <PERSON> Mota </PERSON> issued the bankruptcy decree late Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> announced. President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> said the bankruptcy petition was not an isolated case but part of a new policy to sell, cut out or close down all money-losing companies and agencies owned or operated by the government. `` The country can not give itself the luxury of having inefficient enterprises, which constitute a burden to the entire society,'' de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said at an appearance Monday in the northern industrial city of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has been suffering from acute inflation and other economic ills since 1982, when international prices for oil, its No. 1 export by far, first dropped. The strike had grounded all <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION>'s 223 daily flights to 42 international and domestic destinations. The <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> called the protest strike after the airline's management announced plans to sell 13 aircraft, saying the sale would leave more than 2,000 ground workers and cabin attendants without jobs. Pilots and cabin attendants have their own unions and did not support the strike. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON>, the union's president, said his organization would fight to keep the airline alive and reiterated that it was interested in trying to buy it. He said the union could muster the support of a number of Mexican and foreign investors, but he did not identify them. <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> estimated the airline would cost $ 200 million to purchase, including $ 70 million in estimated severance pay to workers. In <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> told reporters that from now on the government `` will demand greater productivity, including some radical re-structuring, as in the case of commercial aviation,'' from its hundreds of money-losing enterprises. <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> started business in 1934 and has been owned by the government since 1957. The strike and the bankruptcy have not affected <PERSON> Mexicana </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Aviacion </PERSON>, the other major Mexican airline, which has been controlled by the government since 1982. <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION> employs 7,200 ground workers and technicians, 1,200 cabin attendants and 800 pilots.

 A mild stock rally fizzled late Tuesday, overwhelmed by computerized selling strategies and anxiety that has afflicted investors since the historic crash exactly six months ago. The Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip stocks, up more than 32 points at midafternoon, slid in the final hours and finished down 8.62 to 1,999.50, back under the 2,000 level for the first time in two weeks. Most broader market indices also fell. `` People are willing to venture into the market on a day-by-day basis, but not much longer,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthel </PERSON>, technical analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> investment firm. `` Without some sort of clarification, I think we're doomed to this type of whipsawed action.'' The market strengthened through the early hours, largely because of sharply higher earnings reported by some leading companies that comprise the Dow average. A partial recovery in the slumping bond market also helped by easing interest rates, thereby making bonds a less attractive alternative to stocks. But bonds weakened in the afternoon on renewed fears of inflation and fighting in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Traders said this helped provide an excuse to bail out of stocks and erase the day's gains Some said the decline was speeded by index arbitrage program trading, the controversial strategy of selling large amounts of stocks and buying equivalent groups of stock-index futures, or vice versa, to profit from price disparities. The result was a seesaw market dominated by professional traders, as reflected in the relatively light <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> volume of 161.91 million shares. On Monday the volume was even lighter at 144.65 million shares. `` Volatility and uncertainty about the economy are keeping a lot of people on the sidelines,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> brokerage. `` This is the six month anniversary,'' he said, referring to Black Monday, Oct. 19. `` It just sort of makes me think that even though it's six months later, we have n't come a long way.'' The number of rising and falling stocks finished about even in <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> composite trading, with 789 up, 733 down and 466 unchanged. Earlier in the day gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2-to-1. Among the most prominent blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> Aluminum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> jumped 3 to 46 -LCB-. The company reported sharply higher first-quarter earnings. Other notable stocks benefiting from higher corporate earnings included <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, up | to 87 |; <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -LRB- to 68 ~; and <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -RRB- to <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 | to 19 -RRB- The company said it had plans to sell 8 million shares of common stock and apply the proceeds to its $ 1.7 billion unfunded pension liability. The Wilshire Associates 5,000 Equity Index, the market value of 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, American and over-the-counter issues, was $ 2.58 trillion, off $ 7.81 billion from Monday. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the OTC market, totaled 192.30 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> composite index of all listed issues fell 0.60 to 146.17. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 1.55 to 300.50, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index fell 1.29 to 257.92.

<HEAD>Grain Markets Rally On Season's First Weather Scare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices rallied Tuesday on the first weather scare of the season even though spring planting has barely begun. Soybeans advanced as much 7 -LCB- cents a bushel on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the grains were n't far behind as drought fears swept the pits. On other markets, energy futures retreated; precious metals were mixed; livestock and meat were mostly higher; and stock-index futures retreated. `` I think we had our first weather scare'' on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON>, grain analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's certainly much too early to be too concerned about weather,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grains specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` But since it looks like the overall acreage base is going to be small this year, the market may be more sensitive to early weather problems.'' At the root of the dry-weather concerns was the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report on corn and soybean planting intentions. The report, issued nearly three weeks ago, indicated only slight increases in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and soybean acreage. Analysts have said that because of the lower-than-expected planting intentions, growing conditions even slightly less than ideal could result in tight supplies of corn and beans. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that inadequate moisture was causing problems for winter wheat growers in the central and northern Plains. Wheat prices rallied on the news and nervous corn and soybean traders reacted as if those crops were sprouted and withering. `` We have n't even got the crop planted and we're already killing it,'' Freed said. Wheat settled 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.14 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -RCB- cents to 3 cents higher with May at $ 2.05 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 \ cents to 3 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 1.68 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 7 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 6.72 a Profit-taking and technically inspired selling erased several days' worth of gains in energy futures prices on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was not even a fairly good rumor today in the market that I could find,'' to cause the sharp selloff, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Crude oil for May delivery plunged below $ 18.09 a barrel, the price it settled at a week earlier May unleaded gasoline relinquished four days' worth of advances while May heating oil erased two day's worth of gains. West Texas Intermediate heating oil settled 39 cents to 49 cents lower with May at $ 18.03 a barrel; heating oil was .82 cent to 1.01 cents lower with May at 49.68 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .92 cent to 1.16 cents lower with May at 52.14 cents a gallon. Platinum futures also posted fairly steep losses on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Over on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, also in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold futures fell slightly while silver gained a bit. The $ 6.10 drop in July platinum to $ 535.70 a troy ounce was `` only some fine tuning of what clearly is a very strong market,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s precious metals and foreign exchange group `` Fundamentally, platinum is very strong,'' he said. Gold settled $ 1 to $ 1.60 lower with June at $ 460.40 a troy ounce; silver was 1.8 cents to 2.9 cents higher with May at $ 6.465 a troy ounce. Most cattle and pork futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in response to higher cash prices, analysts said. Live cattle were unchanged to .72 cent higher with April at 74.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent lower to .45 cent higher with April at 78.95 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to .38 cent higher with April at 44.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .08 cent lower to .90 cent higher with May at 52.10 cents a pound.

 The dollar moved marginally higher against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar in light trading Tuesday, continuing to draw support from tensions in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Gold prices fell. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 456.75 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 458.75 late Monday. Traders said the dollar got a lift from a drop in the British pound. The pound, which has gained against all major currencies, traded Monday at a six-year high against the dollar. But rumors began flying in earlier overseas markets that `` because of the strength of the pound, there was a potential for a cut in British interest rates,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, senior trader at <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Those rumors `` took the pound down like a bullet ... and the dollar did better because of the weakness of the pound,'' he said Tensions in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Iranian forces clashed Monday, offered some support for the dollar. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attacked two neutral ships and more mines were sighted in the gulf Tuesday. `` We're in a holding pattern with the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tensions,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` If those tensions fade into the background, we might see the dollar slip ... because the underlying sentiment is still bearish in the wake of the trade numbers,'' he said refering to last week's report of a larger-than-epected February trade deficit Trading was uneventful earlier in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where the dollar also edged marginally higher. Dealers there said a resumption of hostilities in the war-torn gulf region would boost the dollar, but otherwise, worries about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy would resume downward pressure on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. `` It may take another one or two weeks, but the dollar will resume its downward trend,'' predicted a London-based trader for a Japanese bank. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to a closing 124.37 Japanese yen from 123.78 yen at Monday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it slipped back to 124.20 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar closed at 124.27 yen, up from 124.23 yen on Monday.

Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday, included: 1.66375 West German marks, up from 1.65975; 1.3760 Swiss francs, up from 1.3735; 5.6590 French francs, up from 5.6370; 1,237.75 Italian lire, up from 1,233.375, and 1.22985 Canadian dollars, down from 1.23205.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday upheld the power of states to control gasoline prices and oil industry profits in a ruling that state officials say will help protect the public when there are energy crises. The justices voted, 8-0, to reinstate regulations in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> that limit oil company profits and prevent an excise tax from being passed on to consumers. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, writing for the court, said the absence of specific federal legislation on gasoline regulation leaves the states free to adopt such rules. The ruling treats <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, a commonwealth, as though it were a state and applies to all states. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> rejected oil industry arguments that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, by eliminating gasoline controls, mandated a free market in petroleum products. There may be a `` general congressional desire'' favoring the free market, he said. `` But unenacted approval, beliefs and desires are not laws,'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> added. `` Without a text that can ... plausibly be interpreted as prescribing federal pre-emption -LRB- of state power -RRB- it is impossible to find that a free market was mandated by federal law.'' The ruling was hailed by <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Genzer </PERSON>, general counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Officials. `` The governors need the ability to respond quickly'' when there are energy shortages, he said. `` I've heard it a million times. When they're standing in gas lines or do n't have enough home fuel, people come to the governor or the state energy director,'' not to the federal government for help, he added. <PERSON> Genzer </PERSON> said the ruling may not have great immediate impact because there are no oil shortages now that require emergency state action. But he said that without Tuesday's decision states could be powerless, for example, to enforce so-called set-aside programs requiring that a percentage of gasoline be reserved for top-priority needs when there are shortages. Most states have laws that give governors broad emergency powers to protect fuel supplies. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said the ruling could have a severe impact on the oil industry and the public if states adopt regulations similar to those in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. `` The experience with price controls in the 1970s should serve as a reminder that consumers are best served by free markets,'' the industry group said in a statement. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling overturns a 1986 decision by a federal appeals court here that said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended to bar state regulation of the oil industry when it lifted controls on gasoline effective in 1981. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized the federal government in 1970 to place controls on petroleum products in an effort to curb inflation. That law expired in 1973. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in the wake of an Arab oil embargo, then enacted an emergency law placing extensive price and allocation controls on gasoline. That was followed in 1975 by a new law aimed at promoting oil conservation. The 1975 law was amended later to provide for gradual deregulation and give the president sweeping authority to lift controls selectively. Complete deregulation by the federal government was required as of Sept. 30, 1981. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, which previously had suspended its regulation of petroleum products while the federal controls were in effect, placed an excise tax on oil refiners in 1986. The Puerto Rico Department of Consumer Affairs then issued regulations requiring advance notice of price increases, prohibiting wholesalers from passing on the cost of the excise tax to retailers and imposing maximum profit margins on sales by wholesalers to retailers. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s regulations, challenged in a lawsuit by oil companies, were supported by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and state and local officials. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counties </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Conference of Mayors were among the groups that urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to rule in favor of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> did not take part in Tuesday's ruling

 <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hancock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> pumps $ 1 million per year into the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marathon </LOCATION>. But the insurance conglomerate figures it gets back at least $ 8.2 million in publicity due to massive coverage of the event. `` The number of people reached is very impressive,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>'s special events director, said Tuesday. Two years ago, <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> estimated conservatively that at least some mention of its sponsorship of the race reached 750 million people worldwide, which it said was the equivalent of roughly $ 8.2 million in advertising. The race on Monday ended in the closest finish in the 92-year history of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> crossing the finish line a second ahead of <PERSON> Juma </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikangaa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>. `` It was a great race,'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. `` The only thing that could have been better would have been a dead heat.'' <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> is not alone in reaping the harvest of good will and free publicity. Most of the major newspapers in the country carried photographs of the runners. <ORGANIZATION> Ricoh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s name was emblazoned on the runners' number tags Coverage of the race was likely to mention that the men and women winners got a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION>. And any pictures from the finish area were likely to catch a glimpse of the silver Mylar blankets bearing the <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> @ Chunky logo that were given to each of the 6,700 runners. <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> goes to great lengths to make sure there are no snags in the transmitting of all that publicity. On race day, journalists occupied two large function rooms at the <ORGANIZATION> Copley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> near the finish line. Part of the staff of some 900 <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> volunteers kept a steady flow of information coming to the reporters from a <ORGANIZATION> Ricoh </ORGANIZATION> copier brought in for the occasion. Camera crews and pool reporters moved ahead of the leaders in a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> media truck. `` I still think it will grow in terms of media,'' said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>. Some 1,200 journalists covered the Marathon on Monday, he said. In the early 1980s, the question of whether the marathon would have corporate sponsorship was debated hotly. Some argued that the race should retain its amateur status but some race organizers were concerned that <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> would be eclipsed as the premier marathon by others offering prize money. Race Director <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> does n't miss the old days. `` We've been able to protect the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marathon </LOCATION> as a unique, tradition-steeped event while at the same time bringing those elements needed to make it among the best in the world,'' <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Coniston Files Countersuit Against Gillette</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A New York-based firm seeking control of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> filed a countersuit in federal court Tuesday claiming the personal care giant misrepresented facts in recent legal action and material sent to shareholders. The countersuit by two <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries is the latest in a series of exchanges in the courts and in newspapers over <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to oust four <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> directors at Thursday's annual meeting in <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> suit alleges <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> presented misleading and false statements in material sent to its nearly 27,000 shareholders and run in newspapers urging rejection of <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover attempt, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewkow </PERSON>, one of <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s attorneys. <PERSON> Lewkow </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> took issue with an indication by <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> was interested in a `` greenmail'' payment to abandon its bid. Greenmail is the term used when a company buys back its stock from a potential suitor at a premium above the market price. <PERSON> Lewkow </PERSON> said the countersuit by <ORGANIZATION> RB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and Bahamas-based RB Partners also seeks dismissal of a <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> suit filed last week. The action does not try to block the annual meeting, <PERSON> Lewkow </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> could see monetary damages against <PERSON> Gilette </PERSON>. On April 14, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> filed suit in federal court seeking to block <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> from soliciting votes from shareholders. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> claims <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> violated federal laws by issuing material that did not fully outline all partners and investors affiliated with the takeover attempt. On Tuesday, Judge <PERSON> Rya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> ordered an April 29 hearing for both suits. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s slate of director candidates includes the three <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principals and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strassler </PERSON>, who was also named as a defendant in the <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> suit. Shareholders can vote in person or by proxy ballot. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s bid received a boost Monday when the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the fifth-largest <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shareholder with about 1.5 million shares, announced it will vote for the <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> candidates. Results of the voting are not expected for at least a week following the meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said its suit should not delay the meeting. The two <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> partnerships have accumulated 6.76 million <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shares, or about 5.8 percent of the company's shares outstanding. In several letters to shareholders since March, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Colman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mockler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> claimed <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> plans to sell or dismember the Boston-based company. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> states it can boost company profitability and stock prices at <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, which paid nearly $ 580 million in late 1986 to halt <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s repeated takeover attempts. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> laid off nearly 2,400 workers and sold several unprofitable divisions during restructuring after <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> signed a 10-year agreement not to seek control of the company.

<HEAD>House Votes Ban On Telephone Pornography Services</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New throughout with compromise plan killed, Senate action
likely Wednesday, education bill passed.
^By STEVEN KOMAROW</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House on Tuesday approved a nationwide ban on `` dial-a-porn'' telephone pornography services despite arguments that the bill was unconstitutional. The legislation, identical to an amendment approved earlier in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, was included in an $ 8.3 billion education bill passed 397 to 1 after lawmakers handed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders a defeat and rejected a less-sweeping anti-porn provision. Final Senate action on the package was expected Wednesday. `` Some may question the constitutionality of this measure,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` But it is the most straightforward.'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, called the measure `` extraordinarily shaky'' on constitutional grounds <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, legislative counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the ban `` clearly intrudes on the privacy and the free-speech rights of adult Americans. This is a hopelessly inept way of dealing with the issue of children's access to dial-a-porn, which should be the only matter under consideration.'' He predicted `` years of litigation, and in the process, increased access by children to dial-a-porn.'' The situation would get worse because current <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rules protecting children from telephone pornography would be thrown away in the process, he said. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, first won the dial-a-porn ban amendment 98-0 when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> first passed the otherwise non-controversial education bill. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had included no similar provision in its version of the bill and a compromise, less legally controversial provision was approved by <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees. While the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment contained a total ban on the services for adults as well as children, the education bill's provision would have had telephone companies block access to dial-a-porn unless the telephone customer, an adult, specifically requested they be made available. Opponents of the compromise said it was too weak and pointed out that about 12 percent of the nation's telephone exchanges did not have the technology to block out the service to some homes but not to others. In an attempt to satisfy both sides, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders on Tuesday orchestrated the vote on a new, separate but otherwise identical dial-a-porn bill. The plan was to have both versions approved, with the education bill's language available if the total ban failed to pass constitutional muster. The separate bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> 379-22. But then, in a defeat for Democratic leaders, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> inserted it into the education bill in place of the compromise. House Republicans carried the day after accusing the Democratic leaders of trying to block the flat-out ban. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., who sponsored the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, called the Democrats' process `` a charade'' by lawmakers hoping the ban would be blocked in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> He called the limited protections in the education compromise `` akin to telling someone it's illegal to sell someone drugs, unless someone walks up to them ... and asks for some.'' Voting against the dial-a-porn ban, when it came up as a separate bill, were Reps. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilenson </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, D-Conn., <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, D-Ill., <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheat </PERSON>, D-Mo Not voting were Reps. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, D-Ga., <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinger </PERSON>, R-Pa., <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, D-Mich., <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daub </PERSON>, R-Neb., <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, R-Ill., <PERSON> Kika </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, R-Mo., <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleczka </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Manton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, D-Wis., <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Morella </PERSON>, R-Md., <PERSON> Major </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, D-Ill., <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, D-Ga., The only lawmaker to vote against the education bill including the dial-a-porn language was Rep. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, R-Ill.

<HEAD>Safety Inspectors Say They Were Told To `Generate Numbers'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal safety inspectors told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee Tuesday they were instructed last September to `` generate numbers'' through sham inspections emphasizing quantity over improving the quality of the nation's workplaces. `` Because the office was short on numbers for the year, they wanted compliance officers to generate double the number of <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> 1 -LRB- inspection -RRB- reports,'' Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, an industrial hygienist in the agency's <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> regional office, testified Tuesday. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and other field inspectors stationed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> described in the second day of hearings by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> how the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> boosted its inspection totals last year by more than 2,000. The committee, chaired by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., has been preparing the hearings for more than a year None of the seven Republicans on the panel have attended the first two days. Before the first witness was called Monday, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> vowed to `` show that the decision to let workers die ... has been supervised and carried out by the highest levels of this administration.'' Assistant Labor Secretary <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Baroody </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> are scheduled to testify before the panel on Wednesday. `` I'm sure we'll be able to set the record straight then,'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Tuesday when asked for the agency's response to allegations raised so far in the hearings. Two senior <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> officials testified Tuesday that, because of intervention by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last month, they are now rewriting regulations to enable some companies to avoid the expense of venting toxic gases from some workplaces by instead making workers wear less effective personal respirators. Career bureaucrats in <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> believed they had won a seven-year fight with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> over the respirator proposal until <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met on March 22 with <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> officials and <PERSON> Baroody </PERSON>. As a result of that meeting, proposed standards are being prepared for White House approval that would allow greater use of personal respirators for short-term exposure to toxic substances or when the cost of engineered ventilation controls are considered `` excessive,'' the committee was told. The current regulations, in effect since 1981, establish a hierarchy of preferred methods for protecting workers from toxic gases. At the top of that hierarchy are the often-expensive ventilation systems. If ventilation is impractical, employers can alter their work practices such as rotating workers in and out of hazardous areas. At the bottom of the current heirarchy are personal respirators. The Task Force on Regulatory Relief chaired by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in 1981 recommended altering that hierarchy to recognize `` technical improvements in respirators as opposed to the blanket regulation of ventilation systems everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary. `` There is no way in my view that respirators can be as protective,'' <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, deputy director of health standards for <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, told the committee Tuesday, acknowledging that <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> calls for new regulations were met with stiff resistence. `` It's a waste of our time as far as I'm concerned,'' added <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Martonik </PERSON>, an official in <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s health standards office. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Martonik </PERSON> testified Tuesday, `` We have finished redrafting it for submittal to <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> for review.'' <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martonik </PERSON> said the respirator issue was revived as a direct result of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Baroody </PERSON>. After the meeting, <PERSON> Baroody </PERSON> wrote a memorandum to <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> about the 48 months of delay on the respirator issue and similar delays on three other changes that had been recommended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s task force `` <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> was critical of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> for failing to meet its commitments and deadlines,'' <PERSON> Baroody </PERSON> said in the March 28 memo. `` The vice president affirmed this and expressed his personal interest and concern in completing the regulatory agenda established by the task force.'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman, described the meeting as a broad review of each agency's success or failure in carrying out the task force's recommendations. `` The vice president did n't set his sights on this particular regulatory item but on the entire unfilled agenda,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. `` In the spirit of let's get going on these items, he said we need to make this part of our agenda for the remainder of the year.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, meanwhile, repeated his charges Tuesday, saying that career <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> employees were instructed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials `` to generate misleading data that give the appearance of zeal as a cover for neglect.'' `` We're going to have a new administration after this fall and, hopefully, we can get this agency back on track again,'' he said after Tuesday's hearing. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallon </PERSON>, an industrial hygienist in <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, office, told the committee Tuesday that she produced 25 <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> inspection reports from a three-day visit to a construction site last September. Ms. <PERSON> Vallon </PERSON> said she believes she was told by supervisors to inspect the site because of a large number of subcontractors on the job and her office was nearing the end of the fiscal year and had not met its quota of inspections. `` They did n't exactly say it, but I drew that conclusion,'' she said in response to a question from <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>. `` We were under constant pressure to get numbers.'' In response to another question from <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Vallon </PERSON> agreed with his assertion that the inspection program `` essentially was a sham.'' <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> records show that the number of its inspections rose from 59,452 in fiscal 1986 to 61,466 last year but were still 3 percent below what they were in 1980, the last year of President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s administration Inspections of manufacturing plants also have declined by 45 percent in the past seven years but inspections of construction sites have increased by 35 percent over the same time to 35,495 last year. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> officials have repeatedly defended that record as switching the agency's resources to where the greatest hazards exist _ construction. Unions, however, have maintained that the policy also has allowed the agency to `` inflate'' its enforcement activity by counting each subcontractor on the site as a separate inspection. `` Most sites average seven to eight contractors, meaning that in reality only 4,500 to 5,000 construction sites were visited,'' <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Steelworkers </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the committee earlier.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday took issue with critics of administration space plans and asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to `` join me in making the long-term investment required to advance <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leadership in space.'' `` Can we afford to stop our exploration and wait for others to pass us?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked in a speech at the annual government-industry dinner of the <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The space station is vital to our leadership in space and contributes to our pre-eminence in manned space flight,'' the president said. `` Some say we ca n't afford the space station.'' But, he asked, `` can we afford to jettison the next generation of technical spin-offs?'' `` Tonight I ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and all the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to join me in making the long-term investment required to advance <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leadership in space,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` We must begin that investment by funding the increases I've proposed for our civil space program.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said it was administration policy `` to encourage private sector investment and involvement in outer space.'' `` We will help develop a highway to space by using private launch services to the greatest extent feasible, and we are working to win legislation to limit liability for commercial launch providers,'' he said. `` It's a future beyond the most distant star in our dreams that beckons us,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the electronics executives. `` And to those who say it ca n't be reached, that it's impossible, I'd just point toward your industries and ask if a few years ago they thought what you are doing today would also be impossible.'' The president also put in a plug for the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, his proposal for a space-based defense against nuclear missiles. `` Five years ago I proposed SDI and, much to my satisfaction, we have made tremendous progress in that research,'' he said. `` We must not stop dreaming because a few naysayers insist on limiting our options for a safe and secure future.''
