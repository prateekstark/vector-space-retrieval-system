 The three Apollo 11 astronauts had another `` splashdown'' Thursday, this time in the form of a party with thousands of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> employees celebrating the 20th anniversary of their lunar landing. Astronauts <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, <PERSON> Buzz </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> arrived from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where they had lunch with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Twenty years ago, I sat in mission control when these guys came down and I would n't miss this for the world,'' said <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> director who is now chancellor for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>. The space center party was patterned after the informal celebrations that followed each Apollo mission. A crowd estimated at 10,000 attended the event. `` This is just like the splashdown party 20 years ago, except then they threw everybody in the pool,'' said <PERSON> Cookie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leisenring </PERSON>, a former employee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, who was trying to take pictures of the astronauts. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> each got loud applause upon arrival. Separate outdoor areas were designated for different departments such as engineering and development, and recovery crew. Inside, a band played in a gym-sized room decorated with star-shaped ballons and blue balloons with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag on them. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> said the astronauts were very pleased to return and visit with old friends. Many of those in the crowd wore buttons showing <PERSON> Armstong </PERSON> on the moon and reading, `` July 20, 1969-1989 We Were There.'' On July 20, 1969, <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> planted their footsteps on the moon while <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> circled above in the spacecraft that later carried the three men back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The splashdown party is one of many events being hel???? z ~ 2to commemorate that historic After the party, the three former astronauts were to attend a private party where they would watch a light display on Clear Lake dubbed `` Thousand Points of Light.'' That celebration was to begin at 9:56 p.m. _ the moment <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> stepped on the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> two decades ago _ when a group of boats simultaneously switch on strings of lights.

<HEAD>Senate Adopts Amendment that Opens Door for Military Aid to Cambodia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Thursday night to open the door to supplying military aid to the non-communist resistance forces in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. By a vote of 59-39, it adopted an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, D-Va., opening the way for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to make lethal aid available to the resistance forces allied with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> in order to stiffen their ability to resist The amendment is to a $ 4.6 billion <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> authorization bill. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> earlier voted 97-1 for a more general amendment that held out the promise of substantial aid to a new Cambodian government, which is `` determined to prevent the return to power of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> and other supporters of his amendment said it was essential to supply lethal aid because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a moral imperative to bar the return of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. That left-wing faction is blamed for the killing of more than 1 million Cambodians when it ruled the country in the 1970's. Opponents of the <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> amendment said opening the door to aid puts the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` on a slippery slope'' in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> similar to the development of its involvement in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. The amendment, similar to one already approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, does not specify the dollar amount of military aid or indicate what kinds of weapons would be supplied. <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> said it does not directly authorize military aid but does give the President the `` flexibility'' to ask authorization for it at a later time. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s action comes at a time when negotiations are opening in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on the future of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after the announced Sept. 30 withdrawal of the occupying Vietnamese army. `` The administration in my judgment needs that flexibility,'' <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> said. `` By aiding the non-communist resistance we advance the prospects for a successful outcome in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. But if we do nothing only heighten the prospects for a bloody civil war and the return of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>.'' But Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: `` Military aid to the so-called non-communist resistance would derail a fast-moving peace process that promises real hope. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, appealed in vain for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to take more time to consider the `` The president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not asked for one dollar in military aid,'' he said. `` I may vote for military aid when the president makes a request for it, when he says, this is what we need, this is why we need it.'' `` I say we've got time to consider this issue,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have to vote for it at this hour of the night.'' `` I stood on this floor when we slid into the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` I think we should let history give us some guidance before we take sudden action here and write a blank check for the president.'' Other senators disagreed and Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, called the <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> approach `` measured involvement.'' `` This is our responsibility lest we be accused of forgetting the lessons of the first Asian holocaust,'' <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said. `` Let us do what is required to keep a second one from occurring.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 65 billion spending bill for housing, space and veterans programs Thursday but decided to cut funding for a controversial program at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. The bill, passed by a voice vote, provides no new money for a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> program currently being investigated by four congressional panels and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for fraud and mismanagement. A <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's report alleged several former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials and Republican party fundraisers, including former Secretary of Interior <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> used political influence to get funding for projects on which they were highly paid consultants or developers. `` We did not want to fund a program which is having such difficulty,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee that oversees funding for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and independent agencies. The bill also would reclassify all deputy assistant secretaries, administrators and directors at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies covered by the legislation as career positions. Persons now in these positions are political appointees of the president. However, it was funding for a planned space station on the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and expanded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exploration that dominated debate on the bill on Thursday, the 20th anniversary of man's first lunar landing. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, attempted to transfer $ 714 million from the space station to veterans medical services, pollution control and research and low-income and elderly housing. `` The space station is not the way to go to space. It is the B-2 bomber of the space program,'' said <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> estimated the space station and a proposal by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a manned mission to Mars would cost $ 400 billion. `` I am a believer in space technology,'' said <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, `` but you ca n't have everything.'' `` As we reach for the stars, let us not forget those who live underneath them'' he added. While <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>'s proposal might save money in the short term, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> warned that decreasing spending for space by small amounts at a time would drive the overall costs up. `` The one thing that is going to drive the cost of the space station through the roof is to nickel and dime it,'' said <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> `` really saves a penny this year but he will be spending pounds and pounds in later years,'' added <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>'s proposal was defeated by a 291-125 vote. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations bill earmarks $ 1.65 billion of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 12.2 billion budget for the space station The bill reduces the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration budget request for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> by $ 1 billion. The bill also provides: _ $ 15.1 billion for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, including $ 9.1 billion for assisted housing and $ 456 million to fully fund programs under the <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> Homeless Act _ $ 29.5 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, including $ 820 million for veterans medical care _ $ 35.5 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> _ $ 5.4 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>

 Federal records indicate past major problems with the tail engine of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 that crashed Wednesday as it attempted to make an emergency landing with about 290 people aboard. The jet's tail engine, or engine No. 2, failed just prior to the crash, and the 15-year-old plane experienced `` complete hydraulic failure,'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. However, it could not be determined Wednesday night whether the tail engine that experienced the previous problems was the same No. 2 engine that was on the jet when it crashed. Meanwhile, a passenger who rode same DC-10 from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Wednesday morning said the plane had been delayed because of technical problems. Mrs. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinsmore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said passengers boarded tha plane and and it began to leave the terminal at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> shortly after 10 a.m., when `` everything sort of shut off.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dinsmore </PERSON> said the pilot came on the PA system and said `` a little gizmo'' had gone wrong. She said the plane taxied back to the terminal, where the plane sat for about 15 minutes while the `` gizmo'' was being fixed. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records, obtained for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, indicate that on Oct. 7, 1988, the No. 2 engine overheated and shut down just after takeoff from <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. An inspection of the engine later revealed that a turbine blade had failed and broken free from the engine's platform. On Sept. 30, 1988, the No. 2 engine also reportedly quit operating at 16,000 feet because of `` extensive high pressure and low pressure turbine damage,'' the report said. The primary cause of the shutdown was a blade that separated at the blade root due to an `` ailing edge crack,'' the report said. On July 20, 1983, the report said, the No. 2 engine shut down due to `` vibration.'' An inspection revealed a broken turbine blade, the report said. The report also indicated problems with the other two engines on the plane. On Sept. 26, 1986, the plane's No. 1 engine was replaced after an inspection revealed a cracked second-stage blade. On Nov. 13, 1987, the report said, the flight crew reported that the No. 3 engine vibrated and lost power as the plane climbed to 4,000 feet after taking off from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> An engine tear-down later revealed that an engine blade failed and caused additional bearing failure.

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> has taken the first step to supply emergency food to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which was singled out for a helping hand at the economic summit of leading industrial nations. Officials of the 12-nation trading bloc put forward a proposal Wednesday for shipping surplus agricultural products to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which is suffering from serious food shortages. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive body, said the food will be provided to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in a way that will ensure that the government begins to take measures to reform the country's devastated economy The plan must be approved by agriculture ministers of the 12 nations that belong to the trading bloc. They are scheduled to meet Monday and Tuesday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the leaders of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> agreed at their summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last week to ship food to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as soon as possible. They also called for a conference to coordinate support for reform measures in both <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, also known as the Common Market, was assigned to take charge of the tasks. In a statement, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> announced it adopted a framework for urgently supplying food to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The food will come out of the stocks the community has built up by its farmers. Officials said the commission was considering a plan that would allow the Poles to sell the community's food on the free market and use the money for economic improvements, such as improving the food distribution system.

 A group that wants to improve the image of taverns in the state's eastern <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> elected a topless bar owner as president, and he says his job has n't been easy. `` I'm not interested in getting publicity about the fact that I own a topless bar. Luckily, it has n't blown up in my face, yet,'' said C.B. `` Butch'' <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Opequon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lounge </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Tri-County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tavern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The association was created following an April gambling raid on 33 bars in the Panhandle in which police confiscated 70 illegal gambling devices, including poker machines. `` The biggest mistake that people have is that all you go into a tavern for is to drink and gamble,'' <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON> said. `` That's just not so. You go in to talk to people. It's like going into a friend's house You relax and swap stories.'' <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON> said the owners were upset by the raid because the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> previously ruled that poker machines are legal. The group plans to lobby state and local government to improve business conditions for tavern owners. `` We just want to show them that we're in a legitimate business and, like everybody else, we deserve a fair shake,'' <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON> said. `` We know more than just how to mix drinks. There are some things we can do to help old folks, children, charities, things like that.''

 A nude sculpture got a second unveiling here when the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> heeded a protest from the work's owner and took down a cloth that had covered the piece. <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, the center's director, said Tuesday the covering had been brought down after complaints were raised last week.

 A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 carrying 293 people crashed Wednesday in an explosive ball of fire and cartwheeled down a runway after the pilot tried to make an emergency landing. At least 178 survived the crash, officials said. A fire official initially estimated 185 to 195 were killed in the crash, but officials later backed off the figure. `` We simply do n't have an estimate we can rely on,'' Fire Captain <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said at a news conference Flight 232, from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, carried 11 crew members and 282 passengers, including three infants on laps, said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagin </PERSON>. He said the three members of the cockpit crew survived the crash and were being treated for injuries. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohs </PERSON>, spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>, said 61 bodies were found. The search for bodies at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was suspended late Wednesday due to darkness and was to resume Thursday. <PERSON> Nagin </PERSON> said a list of the dead and survivors would be released as soon as possible. He could not confirm the number of dead. The plane crashed on an inactive runway at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after circling for about a half-hour while pilots told passengers to prepare for a crash-landing, survivors said. The accident was one of the deadliest air disasters in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. The 15-year-old plane had `` complete hydraulic failure'' before the crash just after 4 p.m., <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. The tail engine failed, and this may have caused a hydraulic failure, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Raynesford </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Nagin </PERSON> said he did not know if hydraulic problems were a factor. A passenger who rode same DC-10 from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> on Wednesday morning said the plane had been delayed in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> because of technical problems. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinsmore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said the plane began to leave the terminal at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> shortly after 10 a.m., when `` everything sort of shut off.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dinsmore </PERSON> said the pilot came on the PA system and said `` a little gizmo'' had gone wrong. It was 15 minutes before it was fixed, she said. Late Wednesday, City Manager <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinda </PERSON> said 185 people were taken alive to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, both in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said seven had died at the hospitals. The search for bodies was difficult because they were scattered in a field of corn 4 feet tall. Rescuers continued to search the corn fields late Wednesday. Dr. <PERSON> Romaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendixen </PERSON>, clinic commander of <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s 185th tactical fighter group, said he was the first doctor on the scene, about three minutes after the crash He had just landed in another plane. He said the living were scattered among the dead. `` In one group of six seats, a woman sitting in the middle was barely injured, her husband beside her was dead and two behind her were dead,'' <PERSON> Bendixen </PERSON> said. He said rescuers pulled out three of the flight crew alive. Survivor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Martz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said there was no panic after the pilot announced there was engine trouble. Then, just before landing, the pilot `` came on and said that this may be more than a rough landing, so do the best you can to assume the -LRB- crash preparedness -RRB- position.'' `` Suitcases, paper, mail, clothes, unfortunately people, were laying all over the runway,'' said witness <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Forst </PERSON>. Still, some people walked away from the wreckage. <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cincala </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a passenger on Flight 232, said there was a fire on the plane, and a fireball `` flashed past us.'' The plane burst into flames after she got off, she said. `` We could see the plane tumbling down the runway,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a witness who said he was working about 1,500 yards from the site. He said the plane broke into `` 15,000 different pieces.'' Maj. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said he had just landed his plane when the jetliner crashed. `` Shortly before touchdown ... the right wing began to dip or began to roll and the nose began to fall to a position of approximately 15 to 25 degrees right bank and possibly 10 degrees nose low,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was very apparent at that moment that he could not make a safe landing. The only question would have been how disastrous a landing would it be. It was a very disastrous landing.'' <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> said that while he was in the air he heard radio traffic from the pilot. `` The suggestion ... was that he could turn only in one direction and he was not sure he could make the runway. Then he turned left and headed for the southwest runway ... and everything appeared to be somewhat about normal.'' Then, the right wing dipped. The plane `` bounced twice, flipped into the air and we were sitting there upside down and it began to fill up with smoke,'' said <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a passenger returning home from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` Then God opened a hole in the basement and I pushed a little girl out. I grabbed another, kept pulling them out until they did n't come no more. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said he thought he helped a half-dozen out and then he ran. Asked about a survivor who reported an explosion before the crash, <PERSON> Nagin </PERSON> said he knew nothing beyond the report and that talk about sabotage was `` only speculation.'' At <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where the plane was due, people waiting for Flight 232 were in a room guarded by airline personnel and police. A clergyman was in the room. Among the passengers of the plane were the two top officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a league spokesman said. Commissioner <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsdell </PERSON>, 25, had not been accounted for early Wednesday evening, but deputy commissioner <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schemmel </PERSON> was among the survivors, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Lavonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Quirin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Buena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> said she and her husband found what appeared to be the plane's nose cone in a corn field at their seed corn business, 75 miles from the airport. The airport has two active runways, each 9,000 feet long, which can accommodate a plane the size of a DC-10. The area around the airport, which is seven miles from downtown, is crop land in corn, soybeans and pasture with some trees. The DC-10-10 was delivered to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> in April 1974. Routine inspections had been conducted on the plane, <PERSON> Nagin </PERSON> said. No unusual weather was reported. Wind speeds were clocked to 30 mph. The nation's worst air crash happened 10 years ago and involved a DC-10. On May 25, 1979, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 191 lost an engine on takeoff from <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, banked sideways out of control, slammed into a field and exploded. All 271 people on board died, as well as two people on the ground. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> cited `` maintenance-induced damage'' _ a 10-inch crack in the engine mount _ that caused the left engine to tear loose. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> also criticized <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>' design as vulnerable to maintenance damage. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> suspended production of the DC-10 airliner in 1983. DC-10 orders collapsed in 1979 because of the recession and the May 1979 crash. In all, 369 DC-10s were produced. The second-worst crash in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history killed 156 people on Aug. 16, 1987, when a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet crashed on takeoff at <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Metropolitan Airport. One child on the plane survived.

 Archaeologists have uncovered the bones of as many as four people in a mass grave near the reputed site where self-proclaimed cannibal <PERSON> Alferd </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>'s victims perished, the scientists said Wednesday. The diggers, who found the bodies of at least two men and possibly four on Tuesday, said they also found burlap and a green suspender clip holding remnants of brown cloth. `` The cloth is most remarkable,'' said archaeologist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>. `` It could help us put a date on things.'' The scientists are part of an expedition formed by <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON>, who is looking for clues to the truth about what occurred on the snow-packed mountain ridge in 1874. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, who formed a gold-hunting party with five other men, said the group became stranded on the ridge two miles south of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> during a bitter winter. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, the lone survivor, wandered into what is now <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in April 1874. He told authorities that <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a member of the group, killed the other four gold seekers and that he was forced to kill <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> in self-defense. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> said he consumed the remains of the five in order to survive. He was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 40 years in prison. The case has been a topic of debate ever since. The archaeologists' findings indicated the men's bodies were wrapped in burlap and buried in a mass grave, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON>, curator of physical anthropology at <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. The bones were in a jumbled mass, forcing scientists to move slowly in uncovering them. As the scientists worked in the dig site, which <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> calls the `` bone zone,'' residents and onlookers kept watch nearby. <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON> said the scientists would test the cloth, suspender clip and other artifacts to estimate their age.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> gave a full-fledged campaign speech on the 10th anniversary of the Sandinista revolution, knowing his government's performance in the next seven months is more important than all the triumphs and failures of the past decade. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, whose country has become the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s poorest, promised better times ahead and said Nicaraguans are better off today than before July 19, 1979, when <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas marched victoriously into <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> He called on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to dismantle the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, most of whom are in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, and even praised some opposition leaders who joined the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> at the start of the revolution then left it, feeling betrayed. About 200,000 people gathered at a huge plaza along the shores of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Wednesday for a rally, the highlight of otherwise lackluster 10th anniversary celebrations. Observers who have been at other anniversary celebrations said most of those attending the 90-minute rally were either party loyalists or public employees afraid of losing their jobs if they did n't show up. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who estimated the crowd at more than 300,000, said the large number showed the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have at least that many votes assured for general elections set for Feb. 25. The Sandinista show of strength at the rally might scare the opposition into abstaining from the ballot, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` But let's all be very clear about this ... they can take or leave the elections, but there will be elections on Feb. 25, 1990,'' he said. `` And they will be clean and honest elections, like the ones in 1984.'' In a 50-minute speech, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said his government is controlling inflation, which `` is not smashing us as is happening in other countries.'' Inflation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> surpassed 20,000 percent in 1988, but stiff austerity measures brought it down to a monthly rate of 12 percent in June. However, the cost has been high. The government has fired 35,000 public employees and tightened credit restrictions and public spending. Foreign aid has decreased. A 10-country European tour in April and May from which <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> hoped to get $ 250 million for the country to survive the year, produced just $ 50 million. Nevertheless, at the end of his speech, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> proclaimed: ` Today the people are better off than before 1979. `` Better days will come,'' he added. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> did not elaborate and left the promises fluttering in the cool morning breeze from the lake. He accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of continuing its `` imperialist aggression'' against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by maintaining a commercial blockade and blocking credit. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still has n't decided to be respectful of the rights of the nations of the Third World ... and of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` If the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is for peace ... he should stop immediately his policy of war against the people of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and allow the Contras to be dismantled from Honduran territory.'' Most of the U.S.-backed rebels are known to have moved to jungle camps in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> after their leaders and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> signed a temporary truce in March 1988. Contra bands still roam northern and central <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and sporadic skirmishes still are reported. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> gave guarded praise to three members of the five-member junta that took control after dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> fled the country on July 17, 1979. The three later left the junta, leaving only <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and current Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, a powerful symbol of upper-class unity with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> against <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> and now the leading contender for opposition presidential candidate, resigned April 19, 1980. She said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' goals were incompatible with her hopes for a democratic <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Wednesday that Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s decision not to accept `` conditions that the gringos wanted to impose on the junta'' was `` firm and courageous.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s family owns the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, shut down several times during by <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> regime and again by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. It did not publish on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Clean Air Draft Plan Sets Ozone Cleanup Deadlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nineteen cities likely would be given 10 years to fix their ozone pollution problems, while severely polluted <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would have two decades, according to a draft of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean air bill. The multibillion-dollar cleanup plan would set four new categories for cities with ozone problems _ severe, serious, moderate or marginal _ and require the most polluted communities to use the most stringent remedies. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> obtained a draft of the proposal, and then applied the latest available <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> air monitoring data to determine which cities would fall into the two most serious ozone pollution categories. There could be some changes when new air quality information becomes available, probably next month, but <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the number of switches should be small. Ozone is a highly reactive gas that irritates and inflames sensitive lung tissues. This causes a host of adverse health effects, including chest pains, shortness of breath, coughing, nausea, throat irritation and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. The current <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> data would place these areas in the `` serious'' category for a 10-year cleanup: Chicago-Gary, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Cincinnati-Hamilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hartford-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain-Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; Milwaukee-Racine, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia-Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del.-Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; Providence-Pawtucket, R.I.-Fall River, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, La.; Beaumont-Port <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, W.Va.-Ashland, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Sheboygan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials verified both the list of 19 areas that would be given 10 years to correct ozone problems and the three cities in the severe, 20-year cleanup category. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators, the organization of state and local air pollution officials, also said he did not expect many changes in the cities' classifications. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to submit the bill to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as early as Friday. The top 80 metropolitan areas in the country, and about 15 rural areas, are out of compliance with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> clean air standards under current law. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal is only one way of attacking the ozone problem, and environmentalists and their supporters in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are expected to push for their own proposals. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that nationwide ozone cleanup efforts would cost $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion a year through the year 2000 and $ 8 billion to $ 12 billion a year afterward. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration legislation envisions the ozone cleanup as being financed largely by industries, including petroleum, automobile, paint and ink producers. Many of the costs would likely be passed on to consumers. The bill would order national measures including new controls on motor vehicle emissions, hazardous waste facilities, and smaller sources of pollutants such as consumer solvents. Oil companies would have to tighten volatility requirements for gasolines. The `` severe'' and `` serious'' areas also would need to have stricter inspection and maintenance programs for motor vehicles; capture emissions from refueling at the gas pump; and EPA-ordered controls on seven additional categories of industrial or commercial sources of pollution. These areas would be required to reduce ozone emissions at an average rate of 3 percent a year _ for 20 years, in the case of severely polluted areas and for 10 years for the serious areas. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan includes a series of existing and new penalties that could be imposed on areas that fail to comply with the law. These steps, which have been applied sparingly by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, include a moratorium on construction of anything that would increase pollution, loss of federal highway funds, restrictions on new drinking water hookups, and withholding money to run clean air programs.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> faces more criminal probes of its nuclear weapons plants _ and mounting public pressure to close them _ unless it controls their environmental and safety problems, federal auditors say. In a report highly critical of department management, the auditors said urgent action is needed to ensure that environmental laws are obeyed and the public is reassured that the government can reliably and safely run the weapons plants. The report dated July 14 was made public Wednesday by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel as a senior <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official disclosed that a special group of experts from outside the department had been dispatched to a weapons plant in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, a special assistant to Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, said in testimony prepared for a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that the experts will attempt to verify the origin of a manmade radioactive element discovered at the Rocky Flats plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The plant processes plutonium for weapons manufacturing. Scientists of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> have said it is possible the radioactive materials strontium and cesium were produced by an accidental nuclear reaction, even though <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> operations do not include the splitting of atoms. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said that while earlier <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reviews of the radioactive material gave no evidence that a chain reaction had occurred, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> wants an independent study to `` help alleviate public concern regarding safety at this facility.'' <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Keif </PERSON>, a department spokesman, said the experts arrived at the site last week and are expected to report their findings by mid-September. He said he had no other details. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> also disclosed that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> have launched an investigation of alleged criminal violations of environmental laws at the Feed Materials Production Center, an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> weapons plant at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>'s statement provided no details, and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said they could not comment. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> did not present his remarks in person because the subcommittee hearing was interrupted before his turn to speak, and it was not resumed. The auditor's report, from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s office of inspector general, said the department is unable to ensure that its nuclear facilities _ including 17 major weapons plants in 12 states _ are meeting state or federal environmental standards. `` Thus it faces the possibility of facility shutdowns, criminal prosecutions of employees and increased congressional constraints over internal operations,'' the report said. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, chairman of the subcommittee, said he was shocked to learn that the department had no way of determining its own compliance with environmental laws. He harshly criticized <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Layton </PERSON>, the inspector general, for not finding this flaw earlier. `` You're not a watchdog, you're a lap dog,'' <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Layton </PERSON> disputed the charge, but later acknowledged that `` in hindsight it may have taken too long'' for his office to take a broad look at the environmental problems. <PERSON> Layton </PERSON> told <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> he decided to take the unusual step of making public a `` flash'' preliminary version of the audit `` because of the urgency'' of the problems it identifies. Among the key findings is that the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is unable to solve environmental problems at its weapons plants because managers and other employees are not properly trained and are not fully knowledgeable about environmental law. The report also said the department had failed to adequately oversee the work of the private companies that operate the weapons plants under federal contracts.

 Negative political ads from `` independent'' advocacy groups are leaving voters with a bad taste in their mouths, says Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>. `` The election campaign of last fall hit a new low,'' the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in pushing for a new law to combat the effects of `` attack'' ads. `` It left an odious trail with hit and run attacks, misleading claims, hidden players and a lack of discussion of the major issues,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>. He noted voter turnout in the 1988 election was the lowest since 1924, at just more than 50 percent, saying the public has been turned off by virulent television spots that slash candidates without discussing substantive issues. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> knew more about <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> than it did about either presidential candidate,'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said. He was referring to ads attacking Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program that freed a convict who later raped a woman. Political analyst <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gans </PERSON> illustrated the level of political rhetoric by showing ads ranging from <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s famous 1964 anti-Barry <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> message counting down to a nuclear explosion, to one against Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., in which a <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> lookalike lit a cigar with roll of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign aid dollars <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> has introduced a bill along with Sens. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., to require broadcasters to provide free air time to anyone targeted by a negative ad from political action committees not connected with a candidate or political party The bill also would require candidates to personally appear in any ad that mentions his or her opponent. The subcommittee is considering another bill by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, D-Nev., and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., that would require political ad sponsors to be clearly identified on the Both bills are aimed mainly at PACs, which under federal law may make direct campaign contributions of $ 5,000 in a primary and $ 5,000 in the general election. But special interests may spend unlimited amounts on campaigns as long it is done without the knowledge or cooperation of the campaigns and candidates that benefit from independent spending. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said his bill would help make `` the playing field more level'' by giving those attacked the means to respond. `` It in no way says to these independent parties that they can not advertise,'' he said. He said the massive expenditures by the PACs _ $ 10 million on broadcast ads in 1986 _ have driven up the costs of campaigns as candidates take out their own ads to shoot back. Except at one point when <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> attacked Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., for ads depicting `` bloodhounds'' searching for an absentee opponent, the senators Wednesday generally steered clear of the touchy subject of negative ads carried out by their colleagues Several witnesses expressed First Amendment concerns about the <LOCATION> Hollings-Danforth </LOCATION> bill. Former Republican Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McC </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said the bill would involve the government in content regulation of political ads. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., said since challengers naturally must attack the records of incumbents, the <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> bill would `` dramatically restrict'' the challenger's ability to wage a campaign

<HEAD>Pilot's Report of Hydraulic Failure Signals Loss of Control</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-DC-10 Crash Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ The pilot's report of `` complete hydraulic failure'' just before a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 cartwheeled into the ground at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, signaled he was losing control of the airliner, officials say. Authorities said the hydraulic failure in the spectacular crash Wednesday may have been triggered by an uncontained engine failure, which would mean that engine parts shot out, possibly into the fuselage. Officials in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> initially estimated that 185 to 195 of the 293 people aboard Flight 232 were killed, but officials later said they did not have a reliable estimate. `` The pilot reported the loss of all of his hydraulic system, which made it very, very difficult to control that aircraft,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>. `` We know he had a real problem bringing the aircraft down and lining it up with the runway.'' <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said the plane's wheels were down but little else is known about the amount of control the pilot had in the final minutes after he warned passengers to prepare for a crash landing. `` We ca n't speculate on exactly how much control he had or what happened up there. All we know is he had a very, very difficult time controlling the aircraft,'' said <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> were all sending teams to assist in the crash investigation led by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said hydraulic failure would mean a loss of primary control over nearly every control surface on the wide-bodied, three-engine airliner. A plane's hydraulic system helps push its wheels down, opens and extends flaps to increase the lift of the wings. It also governs other control surfaces of the airplane on the wings and tail, and controls the brakes once the plane is on the ground. Failure of the system does not necessarily mean the pilot has no control, but it could make it more difficult to stabilize the aircraft, particularly in landing. Even with a hydraulic failure, backup mechanical systems could have allowed some control over wheels, flaps and other surfaces that control flight and landing, <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said. But he and other aviation experts said manual control can be difficult. Some aviation experts said they doubted the complete system could have gone out. `` I think we can say that we have a flight control problem, but we did not have an airplane that was totally out of hydraulics, or he would n't have been flying at all,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nance </PERSON>, a pilot and aviation writer, in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolk </PERSON>, an aviation attorney and licensed transport jet pilot in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said complete hydraulic failure on a DC-10 should be impossible because of required backup systems. Investigators cited partial hydraulic failure as contributing to a May 1979 crash of a DC-10 that killed 273 people seconds after takeoff from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The engine on that plane tore off and somersaulted over the wing, doing extensive damage to hydraulic fluid lines and electrical cables. Loss of hydraulics also was a factor in a 1974 crash of a Turkish DC-10 in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that killed 346 people. A buckling of the floor caused by decompression when a cargo door blew off severed hydraulic lines. After that, the control lines in DC-10s were rerouted along the ceiling.

 Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> foreign ministers tentatively agreed to grant <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mediators an additional month to help promote a solution to the political crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but deferred until Thursday a decision on other key aspects of a formal declaration. The deliberations adjourned at 1:02 a.m. EDT Thursday after negotiations that began Wednesday morning at the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. A draft proposal calls for a transfer of power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Sept. 1, 1989, and the holding of free elections in the briefest period possible. These steps are to be carried out through `` democratic means and in conformity with existing internal Panamanian procedures.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian opposition representatives attending the meeting expressed disappointment with the proposal, contending that it could be interpreted by <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to his advantage. Their comments indicated that efforts to toughen the language would be made at the Thursday session to bring additional pressure to bear on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Addressing the meeting at <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in early evening, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> issued a forceful appeal for decisive <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> action to ensure the restoration of democratic rule in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` It is time to end the crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the suffering of the Panamanian people,'' <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> inaction would invite military leaders elsewhere in the hemisphere to oust elected governments, he added. He said that drug traffickers also would be encouraged if the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> refuses to meet the challenge in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Ecuadoran Foreign Minister <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, a member of the mediating team, said he believes two months of efforts by him and his colleagues have raised the possibility of a `` national accord'' leading to a restoration of democratic rule in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He said the basis for his hope was the contacts in recent days between government and opposition leaders in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> aimed at reaching a solution. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> was cautiously optimistic about the prospects for a democratic outcome by Sept. 1. According to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s constitution, a new president must be sworn in by that date. The possibility of a national accord was alluded to in a report the mediators submitted to the meeting Wednesday, the deadline for the mediation team. Some delegates felt that the discussions in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> could lead to a government of national reconciliation and most foreign ministers felt there was no alterative but to extend the deadline. Delegates were expected to extend the mandate of the mediating team until late August but there was disagreement over the precise date and other aspects of the final declaration. Opposition leaders in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> said Wednesday they would not agree to any such proposal for a government of national reconciliation. `` We are not going to betray the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people. We are not going to accept that junta even if they give it the name of National Reconstruction,'' said <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, the opposition presidential candidate in May 7 elections. Intense give-and-take behind closed doors delayed the official opening of Wednesday's meeting by about four hours. After a public session lasting less than an hour, the meeting was recessed as delegates continued behind-the-scenes efforts to reach a compromise on the wording of an official declaration. The crisis was precipitated by the decision of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s electoral authorities to annul the outcome of presidential elections May 7. Independent observers said the candidate opposed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, had won a landslide victory. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> on May 17 appointed its mediating team to promote a democratic `` transfer of power'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It also blamed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for the `` grave events'' that occurred in connection with the elections _ a reference to bloody attacks on opposition candidates by government security forces. There was strong sentiment in the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, particularly among some <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> governments, not to bring too much pressure to bear on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> charter forbids interference in the internal affairs of member countries. But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which has been a strong advocate of using maximum pressure to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out, has been saying the charter also lists democracy as the system of government that all member states should adhere to. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also was based on drug smuggling indictments handed down last year against him by two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand juries. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials also argued that OAS credibility in the hemisphere could be preserved only by a strong stand against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Opposition to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> led the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to state Wednesday, in a provision added to a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> bill, that it would not accept any nominee for administrator of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> selected by him. The treaty under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will turn over the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> calls for a Panamanian administrator acceptable to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to be appointed next year by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 The Santiaguito volcano spewed red-hot lava and a 15,000-foot column of ash and steam, a seismology official said. A resident of the city of <LOCATION> Coatepeque </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of the volcano, said ash fell on the city when the volcano erupted Wednesday and lava could be seen glowing on the mountain after dark. <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, assistant director of the seismology station in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Santiaguito </LOCATION>, 140 miles west of the capital, is constantly active but Wednesday's eruption was unusual. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and authorities in <LOCATION> Coatepeque </LOCATION> said they were on alert. If the activity continues, coffee and other fields in the western provinces of <LOCATION> Quezaltenango </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Retalhuleu </PERSON> could be affected, emergency officials said. <PERSON> Santiaguito </PERSON> is considered a second crater of the adjacent 12,447-foot <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> volcano.

 Ringers are sounding everywhere in this picturesque northern <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> town where the 1989 World Horseshoe Tournament is being held. Iron clangs morning till evening as almost 1,500 people from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> compete in the pastime that's enjoying new popularity because President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> enjoys it and even plays at the White House. Horseshoe contestants sporting colorful, lettered shirts similar to those bowlers wear are everywhere in this town of about 5,000 people. Motels are full, and many players and their families are staying in cities as far as 40 miles away. The two-week tournament features $ 73,450 in prize money. `` It's an old-timers' sport that's having a new revival,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Champion </PERSON>, publicist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horseshoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pitchers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The 16,000-member group has grown considerably in the past few years, he said. `` There's a pitcher in every town someplace,'' Champion said. `` Anybody can get into it regardless of how old you are.'' Horseshoe pitching originated with soldiers in ancient <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> who used discarded horseshoes for sport, imitating discus throwing at the Olympian Games; more than 30 million people now pitch horseshoes in tournaments or in city parks and backyards, according to the organization. Although the average age of horseshoe pitchers is about 45, entrants in the tourney range from 7 to 88, said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ficek </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Spearfish </LOCATION> resident and horseshoe player who helped organize the event. The sport is relaxing and tosses together a good mix of camaraderie and competition, <PERSON> Ficek </PERSON> said. But he said horseshoe pitching at the tournament level can be physically grueling. `` In a tournament, you'll probably walk 2 -LCB- miles and throw a ton of iron,'' <PERSON> Ficek </PERSON> said. Horseshoes weigh either 2 pounds, 8 ounces or 2 pounds, 10 ounces, <PERSON> Ficek </PERSON> said. They are tossed 40 feet by men and 30 feet by women and those under 17. <PERSON> Ficek </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON>, who also throws horseshoes, said the competition sometimes gets tense. `` Especially if you need that last ringer to win and they keep topping every horseshoe you put on the stake,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ficek </PERSON> said. A ringer, when the points of a horseshoe encircle a steel stake in a clay or sand pit, counts as 3 points. One point is awarded when a horseshoe lands within 6 inches of the stake. Two people compete in a game by throwing two horseshoes each to the other end of the court. They then walk to the stake and tally points before repeating throws to the opposite pit. The first to get 40 points is the winner. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Traversie </PERSON>, 70, said he took up the sport 15 years ago when his doctor urged him to get some exercise. He said he practices three hours daily. `` You ca n't teach nobody how to throw a horseshoe,'' <PERSON> Traversie </PERSON> said. `` It has to feel natural to you. <PERSON> Traversie </PERSON> said he was disappointed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was invited to attend the championship event, could n't make it. `` He should have at least showed up and throwed a couple of shoes,'' <PERSON> Traversie </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> could face more grilling on his nomination to be the nation's civil rights chief as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> seeks to resolve questions about his fitness for the job. `` There are a lot of charges against him. We need to get to the bottom of them,'' Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., said Wednesday after <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was questioned for more than three hours about his views, his qualifications and his character <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> defended both his commitment to the drive against discrimination and his actions when customs inspectors found $ 8,800 worth of undeclared goods in his luggage. Afterward, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., who chaired the proceeding, said members reserved the right to recall him for more questioning <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> should be questioned again about a number of issues, including the fact that the black Republican from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> made misstatements on a sworn application to be admitted to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bar in 1981. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> did not disclose on the form that he had once failed the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> bar examination when asked if he had taken the test in other states. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> testified that when he filled out the 1981 form he interpreted the question to pertain only to any previous applications to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bar. `` There was no intent to mislead,'' he said. Several Democrats on the panel questioned whether <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a lifelong Democrat who became a Republican in 1985, had the legal credentials and commitment to assistant attorney general for civil rights. `` It remains to be seen whether Mr. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is the right man for this important job,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` If a case is brought to me involving a cross burning on the lawn of a citizen, believe me, this is not just cold facts to me,'' said <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, 61, who was sheriff and later chief executive of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` I have been there. I have smelled the smoke,'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> defended a series of recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions that civil rights lawyers say will make it harder to win discrimination cases in federal courts. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, echoing a pledge by Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, said he would monitor the impact of those decisions on discrimination suits and push for legislation if the rulings thwart civil rights enforcement. But Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said he was troubled by <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' defense of the recent high court rulings, adding, `` I've been around long enough to know time slips away.'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> also questioned <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> about why he was fined $ 594 by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 for failing to declare $ 8,884 worth of merchandise the <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> family brought back from a trip to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` How do you explain concealing receipts and merchandise from the customs inspectors?'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said, reading from an April 24, 1985, report of the incident at the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> airport. The report said `` there was a deliberate effort by all -LRB- family -RRB- members to conceal goods and receipts.'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> explained that customs agents found several pieces of undeclared jewelry in a cosmetics case carried by one of his daughters who accompanied him on the business trip to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said he reported $ 4,800 worth of merchandise, relying on what his wife and two daughters told him they had bought. `` I reported exactly what I was advised of. I did not personally examine any of these things,'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said he discussed the incident with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who investigated his background before his nomination by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as well as with committee staff members. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> called the customs violation `` pretty minor-league stuff.'' `` Our feeling is that he had a very strong appearance today, answered any and all questions put before him by the committee,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` We are ever more confident that he'll be confirmed.''

<HEAD>Plastic Foam Bans: Is Government Missing the Point?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 From the tiniest city council chambers to the meeting rooms of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, elected officials around the nation have discovered a threat to the environment in front of their very noses: coffee cups. Not just any coffee cups, but those made of plastic foam, the stuff that keeps hot things hot and cold things cold and protects those billions of McDonald's hamburgers. Increasingly, local governments are banning the use of such products on grounds that they contribute to the nation's overflowing garbage crisis and contain chemicals that harm the Earth's ozone layer. Such bans are easy and politically popular. Some experts say they also may be misguided and pointless. The concern for the ozone layer is now largely moot. In a quiet revolution that has taken place during the past 15 months, the plastics industry has phased out most of the ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons that were used to manufacture plastic foam. The other concern _ landfill _ comes closer to the target. But environmentalists and plastics industry officials argue it's pointless to ban plastic foam products when they are usually replaced by cardboard or plastic-coated paper `` Neither are being recycled and both are going to take up the same amount of space in landfill,'' said <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirka </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` The problem is really a trend toward disposability.'' More than a dozen cities and counties have enacted bans on the use of disposable foam products made of polystyrene, a tough, flexible plastic. In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a bipartisan group of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members has asked for the removal of polystyrene cups from the congressional restaurant system. Private companies are getting into the act, too. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> recently banned use of plastic foam in its company cafeterias, and the <ORGANIZATION> Yosemite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Curry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the private concessionaire at <ORGANIZATION> Yosemite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, decided last year to phase out plastic foam containers. The severity of the bans varies widely. <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, banned the use of foam cups and plates in city offices only, while <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, ordered stores throughout the county to stop selling food in polystyrene or polyvinyl containers. That ban has been held up by a court challenge. In one of the most comprehensive ordinances, the city councils of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, voted earlier this year to ban non-degradable, non-returnable, non-recyclable packaging. In the latest action, the <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, city council voted Tuesday to ban use of all plastic foam made with chlorofluorocarbons _ CFCs _ as part of a larger ordinance to halt all use of the ozone-depleting chemical. Two years ago, a ban like <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>'s would have had a dramatic impact. But because of changes in technology, the plastics portion of the ordinance is likely to go unnoticed by food buyers. Under pressure from government and environmentalists, the plastics industry began producing a new type of plastic foam in April 1988 made with a modified version of CFCs. Most of the new gas breaks down in the lower atmosphere, sparing the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere from about 95 percent of the damage wreaked by CFCs. By the end of this year, all plastic foam food service products such as plates, cups, and egg cartons should be made entirely without ozone-damaging CFCs, according to spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> of the Foodservice and <ORGANIZATION> Packaging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The transformation earned plaudits from the federal government and grudging support from environmental groups. But the debate over disposal continues. A plastic cup may have a useful life of five minutes, but some scientists believe it could take as long as 500 years to decompose. Recent research, however, has shown that while plastic takes longer to degrade, paper lasts so long in landfill that the distinction is meaningless. One solution is recycling, which the plastics industry insists is its goal. Seven plastics manufacturers announced recently a $ 14 million program aimed at recycling 25 percent of all disposable polystyrene products by 1995. McDonald's has begun experimental recycling programs at restaurants in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. An initial evaluation of the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> program indicated it was effective `` We want to eliminate what goes into the solid waste stream, and not just substitute one substance with another,'' said <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>'s spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON> These projects encourage some environmentalists. `` To the degree that we can turn Styrofoam into a truly recyclable material ... I think that will largely alleviate, in my mind, the concerns associated with plastic,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Denison </PERSON>, a senior scientist with the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>US Farmers Get $3.8 Billion in 1988 Drought Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, 905 farmers collected federal 1988 drought benefits totaling more than $ 17.1 million, an average of about $ 18,925 each. Eight farmers in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> got $ 132,836 from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> under last year's drought aid program, an average of about $ 16,600 apiece. Most payments, however, averaged far less than those examples, according to financial reports released by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Nationally, a routine <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> report showed recently, approximately $ 3.78 billion was paid to 789,707 farmers under the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988. Payments by state were listed but the numbers of farmers in each state were not. The agency provided supplemental information, including a breakdown of the number of farmers by state, at the request of The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. A sampling of state averages, including the top five states, was computed by the AP. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostoff </PERSON> of the agency's information resources management division said Wednesday the numbers of farmers listed by state would not add up to the national total. That is because if a farmer has property in two states, for example, each will show up in the state figures, she said. Nationally, however, the farms under the same ownership are counted as a single unit. Most of the producers nationally _ 709,222 as of June 30 _ benefited because of crop losses due to last year's drought, with some also collecting under other provisions of the program, such as livestock feed benefits. The national figures showed that more than $ 3.3 billion of the $ 3.78 billion paid out so far was for crop losses. On an overall basis of total benefits, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> led the nation with about $ 407 million received by 49,144 farmers, an average of $ 8,280 each. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> was second with nearly $ 396 million going to 52,285 producers who averaged $ 7,490 each. Third was <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> where 98,775 farmers averaged $ 3,830 each for a total of $ 378.8 million. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was fourth overall at $ 326.5 million, an average of $ 4,520 to each of 72,169 farmers. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> was fifth with more than $ 311 million, averaging $ 5,450 among 57,083 recipients. In all, farmers in the five states collected about $ 1.82 billion under the 1988 drought program, accounting for 48 percent of the total. The state with the smallest number of drought aid recipients was <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where the report showed one farmer collecting $ 6,640 from the government. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> showed two farmers, but they got only $ 4,282, an average of $ 2,141. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, traditionally the leader in terms of agricultural sales value, got about $ 20.8 million in drought assistance, an average of $ 7,260 among 2,864 farmers. In some of the smaller eastern states, where farms often produce high-value specialty crops, the averages were relatively high. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, for example, 58 farmers averaged $ 11,453 each for a total of $ 664,300. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, where winter wheat farmers suffered greatly this year as the 1988 drought lingered, got $ 61.4 million in aid, an average of $ 1,740 for each of the 35,255 farmers who got benefits. Here are the 1988 drought payments as of June 30, by state, as reported by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. State payment averages, however, were not included. The first column of figures is the number of producers for each state. The second column, rounded in thousands of dollars, is the total amount paid. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> was omitted by the agency.

 The Freedom of Information Act gives foreign competitors `` unique access'' to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology, and an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official suggests restrictions might be needed to stem the flow. `` The government's role is to make sure that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry has the initial opportunity to develop U.S.-sponsored'' research, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, deputy assistant energy secretary for international affairs, said Wednesday. `` The Freedom of Information Act ... has granted foreigners unique access to our technology,'' he said. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on international scientific cooperation they support restricting the FOI law to limit foreign access to information where it could hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness. The panel was considering how foreign access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> science and technology compares to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to foreign technology. <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> conceded that providing exemptions would be difficult. `` It is an effort to balance two very important objectives,'' <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, he said, wants to continue to provide access without giving foreign competitors an edge. He proposed giving certain technology to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry for a specified time before making it available for general release. `` We are n't looking for an open-ended authority,'' <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON> said. `` We're trying to get a door on the barn before too many horses leave.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Millburn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which already has some FOI exemptions, told the subcommittee the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> supports the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and DOE requests.

But he and others testified that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is often shortchanged in such exchanges. `` Many of our scientists and engineers are still subject to what is known as the ` Not Invented Here Syndrome,' which makes those afflicted by it undervalue the importance of research performed elsewhere,'' <PERSON> Murrin </PERSON> said. `` The Japanese, on the other hand, eagerly seek new scientific and technological knowledge from any source,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The nation's worst aviation disaster occurred 10 years ago when an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 crashed on takeoff from <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. On May 25, 1979, Flight 191 lost an engine, banked sideways out of control and slammed into a field, exploding into an inferno. The furrow plowed in the field by the jetliner's left wing is still visible. The jetliner was reduced to scattered debris. All 258 passengers and 13 crew members were killed, as were two people on the ground. `` To this day, it's something that's hard to comprehend, how a big plane like that could disintegrate into little pieces,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Devito </PERSON> of <PERSON> Mokena </PERSON>, who had driven his girlfriend to airport to catch the ill-fated Los Angeles-bound flight. Wednesday's crash in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, is the first major domestic accident involving a DC-10 since the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> disaster a decade ago. The National Transportation Safety Board laid the primary blame for the 1979 crash on the airline, citing `` maintenance-induced damage'' _ a 10-inch crack in the engine mount _ that caused the left engine to tear loose. It also criticized <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>' design as vulnerable to maintenance damage The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> also said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had been remiss by not learning that a similar crack had recently been repaired in a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10. Since the accident, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has been `` very specific about what has to be reported to us and what does n't,'' spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said last spring. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said the only change made in the DC-10 pylon design was a shift to flathead rather than raised-head bolts.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chairman wants <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> to authorize independent tests of special switches used to detonate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles following reports that the manufacturer failed to test the product. In a letter to <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> released Wednesday, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., said the company also worked on the switches with equipment `` which had not been inspected, calibrated or tested for conformance with accepted criteria for up to seven years. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> cited the findings of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> which investigated printed wiring boards, also known as stator switches, manufactured by Asher Engineering. The service found that from 1982 to the present the switches were not tested in accordance with military guidelines and failed to meet specifications, <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said in the letter. The subcontract awarded to Asher Engineering was for production of stator switches for the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> AAMRAM </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>, Sidewinder, Sparrow, Maverick, Harpoon and Harm missile systems. `` Without working stator switches, these missiles will not detonate,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight and investigations called on <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> to authorize spending for independent tests of the switches. `` The subcommittee is concerned that the devastating impact of not continuing to use <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> stator switches and the possible recall of seven years worth of missile production will create tremendous pressure within the system to use the substandard or defective components,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said. A woman who answered the telephone at Asher Engineering in <LOCATION> Baldwin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said no one at the company could comment on the letter. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy assistant inspector general, in an memo April 20, said the untested switches `` could present a serious hazard to both the missile system and to national security if found to be faulty.'' In the memo, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> also said investigators have n't determined whether the switches were used on other weapons systems The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avionics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> performed a quick audit of Asher in May 1989 and concluded `` it is evident from the samples that the manufacturer used different processes on the same type boards and had poor process controls.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s director of reliability, maintainability and quality assurance, in a July 10, 1989, memo, said, `` there is not sufficient technical justification for using these circuit assemblies in such a critical application.''

 Former Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> will testify at least twice more before a congressional panel investigating scandals in programs under his stewardship at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> will return in the fall to discuss contradictions between his earlier testimony and witnesses' statements that he was directly involved in approving questionable <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> had already agreed to return to the House Government Operations employment and housing subcommittee Aug. 3 to answer questions about a $ 15 million <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> project headed by a former law partner of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> told congressional investigators in May he was not directly involved in funding decisions in many of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s programs which have been criticized for alleged influence-peddling and mismanagement during his eight-year tenure. But <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> McVay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>, former assistant for housing, testified Friday that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> personally ordered her to approve funding for the project in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said staff members for the panel met with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> on Wednesday. `` There was no discussion with respect to the substance of his statements,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. `` That would have been inappropriate.'' `` It was a relaxed, lengthy, cordial and productive meeting,'' he said. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said the panel's questions next month would be limited to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s role in funding the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> project to convert a defunct hosiery mill to housing for the elderly. The project was pushed by a former <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> law partner. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> staff members had opposed government funding because the project was too expensive and its location on top of a toxic waste site made it environmentally unsafe. Because of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s approval, developers received more than $ 11.3 million in rent subsidies, a $ 2.3 million <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> and more than $ 3 million in tax credits. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> also agreed to return to discuss `` a range of issues'' in September or October, said <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A retired pilot who investigated the downing of <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 007 says the crew of the ill-fated flight radioed false position reports as he 1,500 miles into Soviet airspace before being shot down. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> told a disbelieving <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> attorney Wednesday that a crew member probably misprogrammed one of the three computerized navigation systems aboard the jet before the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 took off from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The pilot, copilot and flight engineer ignored numerous other plane instruments and navigational aids on the ground as they flew 300 miles off their assigned course, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> testified in the second day of the civil trial. `` All three of them disregarded all those instruments?'' asked <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, an attorney representing the airline. `` That's about what I'm telling you, yes,'' replied <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>, who worked with an international team that investigated the Sept. 1, 1983 shootdown that killed all 269 people aboard. The families of the passengers are trying to prove willful misconduct by <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION>, alleging the plane's crew knowingly continued off course because they would have had to turn back and face disciplinary action to correct the problem. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, noting improperly set instruments would have told the crew they were 300 miles from the airport while they were still on the ground, asked whether the crew then reported false position reports during the flight. `` I am sure of it,'' replied <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> then asked the question that has been central to the Flight 007 mystery since a Soviet fighter jet shot the plane out of the night sky: Why did n't the crew merely turn left and get out of Soviet territory? `` That's what boggles our mind, why did n't they?'' said <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>'s conclusion that plane spent its last three hours in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> territory `` sheer speculation.'' But the available radar data for the initial part of the flight and information provided by the Soviets and Japanese governments shows `` that airplane was well right of course,'' said <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` There is mountains of evidence and it's irrefutable.'' The crew thought they could `` sneak through <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>?'' asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> said the pilot probably concluded, `` I think I'll take a shot at it.'' The pilot may have believed he could `` get away with it, and he damn near did,'' said <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>.

 A teen-ager who won a <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> beauty contest lost her court bid to compete in the Miss Teen USA pageant after she was disqualified for competing in two states. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teen </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON>, should have realized that competing in preliminary teen pageants in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> could disqualify her. `` She should have known the rules,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. The 5-foot-8 green-eyed blonde said she was disappointed but glad to have had her day in court, which was attended by about 10 high school-age boys. `` I respect the judge's decision and we knew it was a gamble from the beginning,'' Miss <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> said. `` You win some, you lose some. Life goes on. `` I just hope this does n't happen to another girl because the rules just are n't clear. I was doing everything honestly.'' She and her attorneys have n't decided yet whether to pursue $ 200,000 in damages against <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Miss <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON>, 18, who lives in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> with her parents but had attended college in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, contended she did n't have a copy of the rules forbidding competing in two state contests the same year She also said she was encouraged by operators of both state pageants, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to enter. Affidavits from the operators show they did encourage her to compete and were n't aware she could be disqualified. <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, who was the first runner-up in the Miss <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teen </LOCATION> contest, will continue to represent <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> in the national pageant in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The finals are Tuesday. Following an anonymous telephone tip, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> was disqualified from the Miss Teen USA pageant June 30, eight days after winning the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> pageant in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. She lost the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> contest in April. No testimony was allowed in the case, but <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> said in an affidavit she did n't understand that competing in two states was prohbitited. She said the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pageant application did n't bar competing in more than one state and the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> application was vague, just asking whether she had participated in another state contest. Her attorney, <PERSON> Carvel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> never said she was a current resident of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but only that she had attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> moved to <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> with her family in August 1988 when she was still 17 and considers <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> her home state. The judge agreed with <PERSON> Kristina </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, the attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, who argued it was apparent from the applications that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> knew she must be a resident of each state to compete. `` She wrote her own ticket into this mess and now she's asking this court to bail her out,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said.

 Children await her with bunches of flowers. Crowds follow her slavishly, shout her name and seek handshakes. Scores of undercover police officers trail her protectively as she traverses the campaign trail. <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, the charismatic leader of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s once lightly regarded Socialists, is getting something that few politicians from her party have had: superstar treatment. `` To be honest, I never imagined she would become this popular three years ago,'' said <PERSON> Sukio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iwatare </PERSON>, a party official and veteran lawmaker, as Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> spoke Wednesday to a crowd in <LOCATION> Kohriyama </LOCATION> in the northern <PERSON> Fukushima </PERSON> prefecture. `` I think it is nothing but her lovable personality that led to this <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> fever. It is amazing that she can easily draw thousands of people everywhere she goes.'' Pollsters and analysts say a new sales tax and an influence-peddling scandal have turned voters against the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the conservative group that has dominated Japanese politicans for 34 years. Women's groups also have criticized new Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> after allegations surfaced that he kept paid mistresses. Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>'s popularity is expected to make the Socialists the main beneficiaries of voters' ire in Sunday's elections for half the 252 seats in the upper house of Parliament. Her party, the largest opposition group in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, hopes to increase its representation in the chamber from 43 to at least 65. Pollsters say the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> likely will fall from 142 seats to fewer than 120. Three years ago, Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> became the first woman to head a major Japanese political party. Her predecessor had resigned over the labor-backed party's defeat in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s last national elections. Since then, the 61-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> has moved the party away from doctrinaire leftist ideas. On Wednesday, about 3,000 people packed the parking lots in front of <PERSON> Kohriyama </PERSON>'s railway station as Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> campaigned for the party's local candidate Some watched from balconies of nearby department stores. `` It is time to bring changes in politics,'' Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> called out from the top of a campaign truck. After a pause for cheers, she added: `` Give us a chance to run the government. We can do it. We can make tomorrow's <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> better together.'' The candidate, <PERSON> Choei </PERSON> <PERSON> Aita </PERSON>, a 60-year-old former labor union official challenging two ruling party incumbents, said Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> `` talks about specific policies but she makes it so easy to understand for ordinary people.'' He added that her speech gave him `` a very good feeling'' about winning Sunday. If the opposition were to win control of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s more powerful lower house, in elections that do n't have to be held before next year, Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> could become <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s first woman prime minister. `` Though there are many more hurdles to be cleared, the opposition camp never had such a golden opportunity to take over the government before,'' said <PERSON> Takayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyagawa </PERSON>, president and noted political analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Seiji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Koho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a prominent research firm. `` And if the opposition actually takes over the government, the head of the largest party in the opposition camp would naturally become prime minister,'' he added. The opposition, however, has been criticized for concentrating on criticism rather than presenting alternative policy proposals. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> emphasizes that her party would not bring make drastic changes if it gained power. `` Continuity is important in politics,'' she told a news conference after her speech. `` It is wrong to think we were trying to bring drastic changes to this country.'' The Liberal Democrats say the Socialists would take such steps as scrapping the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> said her party would not unilaterally abandon the pact.

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Child Care Benefits</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Should stand</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, badly split by disagreements over catastrophic health insurance and capital gains, is having no trouble boosting federal aid to low-income working parents with children. A bill whose chief goal is cutting the federal deficit has been fattened to include $ 16 billion in direct credits and state-administered grants to help parents pay expenses of child care. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the committee, hailed the child care package as `` a giant step forward. Noting the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration disagrees with some of the provisions, he called on the administration to `` commit itself to its campaign promise and do something for children.'' The child care plan was added to the bill on a 26-10 vote Wednesday after the panel was unable to settle disputes over capital gains and catastrophic insurance for older Americans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called for a cut in the capital gains tax, which applies to profits from the sale of stock and other assets, on grounds it would spur the economy and increase revenues. Many Democrats concede a one-year revenue gain but say a cut would lose revenues after that. Besides, they note, most of the tax benefits from a reduction in the capital gains tax would go to those with incomes over $ 100,000 a year. The fight over catastrophic illness also includes an element of rich-vs. Higher-income retirees are complaining loudly because they must pay a larger share of the cost so the benefits can be available to those with little or no income. Those with higher incomes want all taxpayers to share the cost of catastrophic coverage. Because of the complaints, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members have shown widespread support for delaying the surtax of up to $ 800 that the higher-income retirees must pay. But since members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> can not agree on that, the panel may simply decide to repeal the entire program. The split over approving the child care amendments has had a more partisan tone. All Democrats and three Republicans voted for the package; seven Republicans, favoring a less costly approach recommended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, voted no. The Ways and Means child care plan, which would take effect in 1991, is closer to a version passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> than to the president's proposal. The committee provisions would benefit families in which both spouses work outside the home as well as those families in which one spouse stays at home to care for the children. It would expand the existing earned-income credit, which is worth up to $ 910 a year in tax cuts _ or in cash if there is no tax liability _ for working families with children and incomes up to about $ 18,000. The committee voted to raise the maximum credit to $ 1,217 for a family with one child, $ 1,540 if there are two children, and $ 1,790 if a family has two or more children. Under current law, the credit is the same regardless of the number of children. The plan would create a new credit for families with one or more children under age 6. This credit, which would be in addition to the earned-income credit, would be for 6 percent of the families' first $ 6,500 of earned income, with a top credit of $ 430 in 1991. A third part of the committee's package would authorize $ 1.55 billion worth of federal grants for social services, with 80 percent of the money earmarked for improving child care services.

 The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Thursday, while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> gained moderately. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 107.70 points, or 0.32 percent, ending the day's trading at 33,664.87. The index gained 213.44 points on Wednesday. The dollar ended trading at 142.23 yen, up 0.43 yen from its closing the previous day. It opened higher at 142.80 yen and ranged between 142.05 and 142.90 yen. Despite the dollar-buying mood at the market's opening, market players turned to selling for profit-taking, and the currency slipped from the opening rate, said a trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. Many investors, however, were making little moves except for position adjustments, he added.

While institutional investors were reluctant to make major moves ahead of the Japanese parliamentary election Sunday, individuals actively bought, said one trader with a major securities firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking anonymously.

 When the pilot of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 told passengers to expect a `` very rough'' landing at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s airport, <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelson </PERSON> held her daughter, <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON>, tight `` I was just mostly worried about being able to hang on to the 1-year-old,'' she said. But Wednesday's deadly crash separated mother from daughter. Mrs. <PERSON> Michaelson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> resident, said about an hour from Flight 232's scheduled arrival in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the pilot said over the intercom that the tail of the airplane had been damaged and that an emergency landing was necessary. `` He said we'd have to land and that it would be a rough impact. He advised us to go into a crash position,'' she said. <PERSON> Sabrina </PERSON> was on her lap, and she held her tightly. Nearby was her husband, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, and their two sons, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON>, 6, and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>, 4. `` We're expecting a rough landing.

As they climbed outside, <PERSON> Michaelson </PERSON> asked, `` Where's the baby?'' Desperate, he went back into the wreckage but encountered thick smoke and was forced to leave. Then they saw the child, apparently unharmed, in a woman's arms.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciari </PERSON>, a French native, is campaigning hard for this weekend's balloting, seeking to become the first Caucasian elected to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm a proud Japanese, and I will do my best to help the Japanese people uplift their image,'' said <PERSON> Ciari </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1967 and married a Japanese woman in 1975. Ciari, a candidate in Sunday's parliamentary elections, became a Japanese citizen a decade later so his two children would be Japanese nationals. `` I'll try hard to defend social justice and protect those who are less privileged and not part of the Japanese success story,'' <PERSON> Ciari </PERSON> said. Koreans naturalized Japanese have been elected to parliament or state legislatures in past elections but that is a rare occurrence in this traditionally closed society. `` It will be a good chance for the people to show to the world that they are making themselves international by electing a French-Japanese,'' said <PERSON> Ciari </PERSON>, a native of Nice. <PERSON> Ciari </PERSON>, 45, a successful guitarist, composer, animator and actor, is running for the 252-seat <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Councillors </ORGANIZATION> under the banner of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a small party that broke away from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Of the 126 seats at stake Sunday, 76 will be decided in electoral districts and the other 50 according to percentage of the nationwide vote received by the 40-odd parties entered. <PERSON> Ciari </PERSON> is second on the list of 10 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> candidates seeking election under the proportional representation system. `` The top candidate, Mr. -LRB- <PERSON> Kazuhiko </PERSON> -RRB- <LOCATION> Takeoka </LOCATION>, will be elected if the party musters about 1 million votes. The borderline for my own chance will be around 2 million votes. I'm campaigning hard so the party can win many million -LRB- votes -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Ciari </PERSON> said. He has made speeches in fluent Japanese at street corners in major western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> cities. He has visited small towns, shaking hands, smiling and bowing as other candidates do. <PERSON> Ciari </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Nishinomiya </LOCATION>, a town between <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, campaigned in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Wednesday. He said he chose the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> because he foresees the party taking a key position `` coordinating between the two major political camps _ the ruling party and the opposition led by the Socialists.'' In Sunday's election he expects a considerable gain by the opposition and a major setback for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who are on the defensive over an unpopular new sales tax and a widespread influence-peddling scandal. The governing party has 142 seats in the upper house, and 73 members who will remain in office for three more years. It needs to win 54 seats on Sunday just for a simple majority of 127 _ a feat many pollsters and analysts say it can not perform. <PERSON> Ciari </PERSON>, a young, penniless musician when he first came to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, became a citizen at a time when children obtained Japanese nationality only if their fathers were Japanese. A few years ago, the law was revised to confer citizenship on children with Japanese mothers. The Japanese government asks foreigners applying for citizenship to submit a new name `` appropriate for a Japanese.'' <PERSON> Ciari </PERSON> registered his Japanese name in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> characters pronounced: `` <PERSON> Kuroudo </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiari </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>House Agrees to Make Federal Facilities Subject to Environmental

<TEXT>
 The federal government would face the same penalties as private polluters for cleaning up thousands of hazardous waste sites under legislation headed for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> with overwhelming approval from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, by a 380-39 vote Wednesday, approved the measure allowing states fine federal agencies that violate environmental laws. Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the legislation was necessary `` to end the hypocrisy that has taxpayers paying to create federal pollution.'' The lopsided <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote improves its chances in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and demonstrates to top-level decision-makers that lawmakers are determined to get quick action on the decades-old problem of government-caused pollution, <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>, the bill's sponsor, and Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, whose district includes a highly contaminated uranium-processing complex, led a successful drive to persuade the House not to weaken the proposal. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, D-Ga., wanted to ban state and local governments from using fines and penalties to force the federal government to clean up existing sites <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said the measure as approved would end up diverting limited funds away from cleanup into state coffers and lawyers' pockets. He and others also warned cleanup decisions could be moved out of the hands of the federal government and into state offices where parochial interests would outweigh the national interest. `` This bill conveys power to the states but not responsibility,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration opposes the measure on similar grounds. An administration statement issued this week said the bill would allow states to fine polluting federal facilities without considering whether there was money in the budget to do the demanded cleanups. But Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich. and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the measure may be the impetus needed to clean up serious contamination problems at government facilities If the bill puts pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and other government polluters, `` perhaps that is good because the people of this country want this mess cleaned up,'' he said. <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders have indicated they'll move on their version of the bill after the Labor Day recess. `` The administration should stop dragging its heels and digging in and start digging up the pollution they've created all across this country,'' he said.

<HEAD>Treasury Takes First Step To Avoid Exceeding Debt Limit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is moving to avoid exceeding the national debt limit next month even while urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to extend the ceiling before lawmakers leave for a month-long August recess. `` It is virtually certain, absent such action, that <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> will run out of cash and default on its obligations on Aug. 15,'' Undersecretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> taxation and debt management subcommittee Wednesday. `` I urge you to seek the cooperation of your colleagues and to act quickly on the debt limit in order to prevent unnecessary problems in <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> financing operations and default on the government's obligations,'' he said. The government is seeking a $ 300 billion increase in the current $ 2.8 trillion long-term debt ceiling. Without an increase, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials say the government would have problems issuing paychecks and Social Security payments in September. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> already has passed such legislation. Shortly before <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON> appeared on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced it was suspending indefinitely the sale of special securities for state and local governments. Such action has been taken before when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was unable to agree on legislation raising the debt limit. State and local governments buy the special <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities as a temporary investment vehicle for money they raise in the bond market. If the securities are not available, it could force cancellation of bond sales by state and local governments, leading to confusion and turmoil in the municipal bond market. <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON> did not mention the suspension in his testimony on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, but he did warn of the other effects of congressional inaction on the debt limit increase. `` Without an increase in the debt limit by Aug. 1, full investment of the Social Security trust funds may not be possible,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> is required by law to invest the trust fund assets in interest-bearing government securities, which are a form of government debt and are counted with other government bonds and notes against the debt limit. While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> normally appropriates money to cover any interest lost to the trust funds during a period when they can not be invested, this action has raised complaints from interest groups representing the elderly. <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON> also warned that congressional inaction into September would prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> from paying the government payroll for September, including payroll and pension checks exceeding $ 23 billion.

<HEAD>HHS Secretary Takes Back Support for Needle Exchanges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, backpedaling on his support for local needle-exchange programs, says there is no valid scientific evidence that such programs curb the spread of AIDS. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, in testimony to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Wednesday, also said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is `` strongly opposed'' to programs to give clean needles to drug addicts because they can be viewed as sanctioning drug abuse. However, pressed by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., subcommittee chairman, the secretary agreed to convene an expert panel to recommend how such programs could be studied scientifically He said the panel could report back to the subcommittee in several weeks. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> had said in a March interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he did not believe needle exchanges condone drug abuse and the federal government would be `` very supportive'' of communities experimenting with such programs. Many experts believe the deadly AIDS virus has been spread through the population partly by the use of previously-used needles by drug addicts. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s statements marked the second issue on which he has backpedaled after straying from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration line. Earlier, his statements that he supported the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing a woman's right to abortion nearly derailed his nomination. Later, he said he opposed abortion except in cases of rape, incest and danger to the mother's life. At Wednesday's hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> health subcommittee, he did not answer directly when asked if his views had changed since March. But he said `` what has occurred is that I have had extensive discussions'' with AIDS and drug abuse experts as well as members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the issue. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s earlier statements alarmed some in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, including drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. At the time, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is opposed to exchangeable needles under any condition.'' In March, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said, `` As someone who is concerned about health, if this is a strategy that shows promise of helping to arrest the spread of AIDS, I think this is something that does deserve a chance for an appropriate trial.'' However, asked Wednesday if he would support needle exchanges if they were shown scientifically to be effective, he said he still would `` want to consult with the other members of the Cabinet, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and others, to look at this thoroughly. `` We want to gather all the information that we can about these programs, and because of the fact that there has not been evidence, clear evidence that these programs are effective, we are not prepared to advocate or come forth with programs,'' he said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said his department planned no efforts to conduct its own evaluation of the effect of clean-needle programs, but he said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>, which is part of <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, would consider applications for research grants for others. Needle-exchange programs are underway in several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. Abroad, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> have such programs <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said studies evaluating the effectiveness of some of these programs are `` not convincing'' because none has compared a group of addicts receiving clean needles with a group that is not. Also, it is not clear whether findings that show decreased needle sharing and no increase in drug abuse are resulting from other factors, he said.

 More than 3,000 gold prospectors have been stranded for two months in remote western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by blizzards and bad weather and 67 have died of starvation, exposure or illness, an official newspaper said today. Worker's Daily said 8,000 miners and 1,000 of their vehicles were trapped by blizzards in May in the <LOCATION> Hoh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Xil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Qinghai </LOCATION> province, more than 16,500 feet above sea level. Rescue workers have sent in 39 trucks, but 3,000 people remain stranded, the paper said. The government dropped 8.5 tons of food into the area two weeks ago after two previous attempts failed because of bad weather.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plans to vote Friday on a $ 14.35 billion foreign aid bill that puts $ 15 million behind President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise to encourage economic reform in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the programs last week during visits to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, pledging a $ 100 million fund to support private business initiatives in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and $ 25 million to encourage enterprises in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The measure, passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, provides economic, military and development aid for friendly countries around the world. It goes before the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the panel's foreign operations subcommittee, said the $ 15 million figure was an informal estimate of the cost of beginning to meet <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pledges in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1 The administration has so far made no formal request to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the aid, he said. Of that amount, $ 10 million is for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and $ 5 million for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. In its report, the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> called <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s June elections and other developments encouraging and `` reasons to believe that real progress can take place and can be sustained over a period of time.'' Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., said Republicans and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will support the foreign aid bill in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but will work in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to shift more money to military aid and make a series of other changes The bill also included: _ $ 160 million for a new Multilateral Assistance Initiative for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, $ 40 million less than the administration has requested. `` I do n't think, given the Philippine track record -LRB- of poor management -RRB-, we ought to be putting in a dime,'' Obey said. But he said the $ 160 million represented a compromise with the administration, which sees the program as a key to bolstering the fledgling democracy led by <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. _ A maximum of $ 85 million in military aid to the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> In a gesture of support to newly elected president <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of the right-wing ARENA party, the committee declined to attach strings to the aid. Some liberal lawmakers had sought to release the aid in two increments, depending on the new government's performance in suppressing the activities of right-wing death squads _ A total of $ 410 million for migration and refugee assistance, $ 40 million more than the administration asked The committee noted increased emigration of Soviet Jews as well as growing refugee needs in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and along the Thai-Cambodian border. _ $ 105 million for the African Development Fund, which provides low-interest loans for development programs in the poorest countries; $ 144 million to the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which makes market-rate loans for agriculture and public works projects; $ 515 million for development aid to sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>; and $ 50 million in development money for countries bordering <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The bill also recommends $ 2 million be set aside for protection of African elephants. _ Mild restrictions on the $ 958 million allocation to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> as an indication of displeasure over loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, whose crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators has provoked outrage on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> As usual, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> receive the lion's share of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid money. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would get $ 3 billion in combined military and economic aid, and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> would receive $ 2 billion. The bill also provides $ 20 million for a program to promote peace in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>; $ 230 million in military aid to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>; $ 12 million for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> strip for education, health and agriculture programs; $ 270 million as part of various drug control programs; and $ 65 million for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is demanding increased cooperation from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in the war on drugs in a move described by opponents as a direct rebuke to that country's new president, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. Senators added the provision Wednesday to a $ 4.6 billion <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> authorization bill for next year, along with dabbling in dozens of other world issues from <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s right to hold power in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to bare grocery shelves in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. But senators were unable to resolve a dispute over an amendment proposed by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, barring official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> who have been involved in terrorism against Americans. In one provision, senators said they would not accept any nominee for administrator of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> who is selected by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s current ruler, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> The treaty under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will turn over the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> calls for a Panamanian administrator acceptable to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to be appointed next year by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> also sponsored the provision dealing with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, arguing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' southern neighbor remains the primary source of heroin and marijuana and a leading transit point for U.S.-bound cocaine. Despite anti-drug rhetoric from the <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> government, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> still has not granted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requests for the right to fly drug surveillance flights over the country, to pursue drug smugglers into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, or to grant access to bank records sought by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug investigators, said <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, a perennial critic of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The non-binding amendment expressed the `` sense of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> should negotiate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on those and other drug issues. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said the amendment was intended to support <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' anti-drug statements and to send `` a signal as to how we will measure their cooperation next year'' when it comes time to certify whether <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is eligible for continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade preferences and other aid But Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., said the move would damage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with the new <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government, calling it `` a counterproductive and failed attempt to engage in another round of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> bashing. In a flurry of other foreign-policy pronouncements, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: _ Approved a provision intended to slow down an emerging U.S.-Korean deal for co-production of a military fighter plane The provision calls for a study on how such a deal would affect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial capacity and long-term competitiveness. _ Voted 99-0 to call on <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to hold a national plebiscite on whether he should continue in power, and if a majority does not support him, to step down _ Approved a provision to rename a small park across the street from the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as `` Tiananmen Square Park'' in honor of pro-democracy demonstrators killed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s crackdown last _ Called on the administration to bar the import of Romanian meat and wine `` until such time as the Romanian government ceases to withhold food from the Romanian people.

 A <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> company claims the pilot who crashed his private plane into notoriety unlawfully billed the firm twice for work he did and illegally converted thousands of dollars of company money to his own use. <ORGANIZATION> Sonrise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, filed suit in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court against <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON> demanding the return of $ 334,000 plus $ 250,000 in damages. Root, a communications lawyer, is accused of failing to represent investors he was hired to speak for before the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The suit alleges Root took in an extra $ 100,000 through double billing. Root is recovering from his plunge into the waters off the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> last week and the mysterious gunshot wound which he says he does not remember receiving. In its court papers filed this week, <ORGANIZATION> Sonrise </ORGANIZATION> says it paid Root $ 1.9 million since March 1986 as an advance against legal fees and expenses and to reimburse him for <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> filing and hearing fees. Sonrise, which assists investors inexperienced in broadcasting but with an interest in operating new FM stations to apply for construction permits, alleges Root failed to adequately represent nine groups of investors seeking permits. Sonrise said that last August it paid Root $ 75,000 that he was to give to applicants for an FM station in Omega, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. Sonrise charges the applicants never got the money and <PERSON> Root </PERSON> converted the funds to his own use Last November, said Sonrise, it paid Root $ 40,000 to hold in an escrow account to buy the construction permit of an FM station in <LOCATION> Galva </LOCATION>, Ill. The agreement was never executed and Root converted the money, the suit said. The suit also accused Root of billing Sonrise twice for the same services from April 1987 through August 1988, with overpayments amounting to $ 54,200. In another case, <PERSON> Root </PERSON>'s escrow account also was paid $ 45,000 twice to buy a construction permit for an FM station in <LOCATION> Olney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pentagon Declassifies List of Contractors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The B-2 stealth bomber, once one of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s most closely-guarded secret weapons systems, is becoming more public each day. The latest <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> step in its high-profile campaign to surmount congressional opposition to the expensive bomber is the declassification of a list of 156 contractors in 26 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> involved in the program. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s B-2 program is supported nationwide by tens of thousands of men and women at prime contractor <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, key subcontractors <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, and other suppliers and subcontractors in 46 states,'' <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> said in a five-page memorandum received Wednesday. The memo, which includes the recently-declassified list of contractors, was sent to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this week. The B-2 program has been shrouded in secrecy for nearly 10 years, but as opposition to the expensive aircraft has grown in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has been more forthcoming with information. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and Chief of Staff <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> briefed members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in an open session that included a color-slide presentation on the plane. On Monday, the aircraft took off on its maiden two-hour test flight with a huge bank of television cameras trained on it as it flew over the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. Asked about the change in public access to the bomber at the test flight, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Tuesday, `` It's a wonderful country, is n't it?'' The publicity campaign contrasts sharply with another weapon, the super-secret F-117A stealth fighter, which remains under wraps. `` I'd urge you not to mix different planes and different missions,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. Despite the successful flight, congressional opposition remains to the radar-evading aircraft that at $ 530 million a copy is the most expensive in history. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> hopes to buy 132 planes at a cost of about $ 70 billion. One Republican, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said of the <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> memo, `` The company has now fallen back to selling the B-2 as a jobs program. But I doubt <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be blinded by the smoke screen that <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> is trying to throw over us.'' In fiscal 1990, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has proposed spending $ 4.7 billion for the B-2, but last month the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> panel cut $ 800 million from the budget. Money for the B-2 is expected to be the most controversial item next week when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consider the defense bill.

 The murder of actress <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> and the fiery assault on <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> this week dramatize the increased perils of living in the glare of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s bright lights. Entertainers have long employed security, if only to fend off the paparazzi. But a string of recent incidents, including threats and attacks involving actors such as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>, have prompted some stars to take greater safety measures. <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s leading security consultant, said the killing of Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> bore similarities to the knife attack seven years ago of his client, `` Raging Bull'' actress <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Saldana </PERSON>. `` This was not <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> or <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>,'' de <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` This was somebody with a far smaller audience. There is a dynamic that says, ` <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> is for everyone, but you're for me. `` There are more kooks in the world,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, business manager of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> here, a union overseeing the 300 guards who protect studio gates. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, was an obsessive fan of Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, police said Wednesday as <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> was charged with murder in the shooting death of the 21-year-old co-star of the 1986-88 CBS sitcom, `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>.'' Investigators looking into another violent attack on Tuesday believe <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Corydon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, was angered by a business dispute with `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' star <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kercheval </PERSON> over a popcorn company. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> crashed a truck through the gate at <LOCATION> Lorimar </LOCATION> where `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' is filmed, fired a burst of shotgun blasts, set his vehicle afire and then killed himself. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said he is in constant demand because of an exponential growth in the volume of fan nuisance letters in recent years. He has expanded into providing security for celebrity weddings and handled last year's nuptials between <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> and actress <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollan </PERSON>. In an unusual departure, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> has set up a separate security post at the offices of his new production company, even though it sits on the <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> lot, itself protected by a squadron of guards. When <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> appears publicly, he is surrounded by a squadron of guards and friends. Record producer <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> is legendary for not making a move without a security guard present, even though few people would recognize him. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> rarely appears without bodyguard accompaniment. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and other stars have installed elaborate security systems around their homes, often including cameras and fence enclosures. Local tabloid reporters single out <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> for having the most sophisticated protection. But despite the security, few celebrities may be completely beyond the public's reach. `` The access is there if somebody wants to get to a celebrity,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> bureau chief for the tabloid <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, itself an expert at gate-crashing. `` The stars can have security guards and security systems more sensitive than a bank's, but people can still buy a star map for $ 2 and haunt these people. `` There really seems to be a rash of these things. We seem to do more stories about obsessed fans than anything else.'' This week, 26-year-old <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie-Ledbetter </PERSON> pleaded innocent in <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to sending thousands of threatening letters and rabbit droppings to <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, star of the former hit series, `` Family Ties.'' She was ordered to remain without bail at the <ORGANIZATION> Sybil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. Two guards were shot and killed at <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> last December by a man who demanded to see <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>, star of `` Highway to Heaven.'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Trupp </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, has pleaded innocent to the charges. A deranged fan of Miss <PERSON> Saldana </PERSON> may be released early next year after serving half of a 12-year sentence for a knife attack against the actress. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a 53-year-old Scottish drifter, attacked the actress in 1982, stabbing her 10 times with a kitchen knife. `` I'm trying not to allow it to bring back bad memories for me,'' Miss <PERSON> Saldana </PERSON> said Wednesday of Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>'s murder. `` I really had a hard time with it this morning.'' In true Hollywood fashion, celebrity stalking has been in the news so much in recent years that the practice has sparked two movies: 1981's `` The Fan,'' starring <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON> and 1982's `` The Seduction,'' featuring <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Failed Business Deal Apparently Provoked Movie Set Suicide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A man who drove a truck through a studio gate, set it afire and then committed suicide had claimed he was the victim of a `` rotten, stinking deal'' involving `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' star <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kercheval </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Corydon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, was voted out of his management position at Old Capital Popcorn in April 1988 by his then wife, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Kercheval </PERSON>, who had bought the company from the couple. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> fired 12-gauge shotgun blasts at the outside walls of a sound stage where `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' is filmed before shooting himself in the chest on Tuesday. An article detailing the Corydon-based popcorn maker's financial woes, published in April by The Courier-Journal of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was among items <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> handed to a studio guard at the beginning of his rampage, police said Wednesday. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a former farm-implement dealer, purchased Old Capital Popcorn with his ex-wife in 1983. <PERSON> Kercheval </PERSON> liked the popcorn so much he invested $ 998,800 in the company in 1985, acquiring a one-third interest. In April 1988, he bought out the remainder of the company. In a statement issued through his publicist, <PERSON> Kercheval </PERSON> said he was `` shocked and astonished'' by the suicide.

Late Tuesday afternoon, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> drove an 18-foot truck to a gate at the Lorimar lot 10 miles east of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> With the newspaper article and truck rental papers, he handed a security guard two canisters of methyl bromide gas, telling him, `` You have five minutes to live,'' police said. Methyl bromide is a caustic gas used to make popcorn, police Lt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Burck </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> then drove through the gate, set the truck afire near a sound stage and fired five blasts from a shotgun into nearby stage walls as he yelled for people to stay away.

 The crash of a DC-10 in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> comes just as <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> prepares to deliver the last of the workhorse airliners plagued by some of history's worst air disasters. The wide-bodied, three-engine aircraft used by 51 world airlines and built by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> has had cargo door problems, been accused of design flaws and was once grounded for more than a month by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The DC-10s have been the workhorse of many airlines, carrying from 250 to 380 passengers, depending upon how their interior is configured. A DC-10 was involved in history's worst <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air disaster that killed 273 people in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1979 and in one of the worst single-plane disasters in the world, the 1974 crash of a Turkish Airliner in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that killed 346 people. Wednesday's crash of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 on its way from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> during an emergency landing attempt in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> had the potential of eclipsing the 1979 crash, but more than half the 293 people aboard survived after the plane cartwheeled into the ground in a ball of flames. The pilot had radioed `` complete hydraulic failure'' prior to the crash landing, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. Failure of the hydraulics system, which is the main means of controlling wing flaps and other mechanisms that guide the aircraft, also has figured in other DC-10 crashes, although the primary cause has varied. The <ORGANIZATION> Turkish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> crash was blamed on faulty cargo door design, which was later altered after nonfatal incidents of doors popping off other DC-10s in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The loss of the door led to decompression that buckled the floor which, in turn, severed hydraulic lines essential to taking off, steering and landing an airliner. Floors in wide-bodied jets were strengthened and hydraulic lines rerouted after the incidents. In the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> crash, hydraulic lines along the wings were severed when one of the plane's engines came loose and somersaulted over the wing. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> grounded all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> DC-10s but allowed them to fly 37 days later. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> determined erroneous maintenance procedures by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> caused the engine supports to crack. The board also said some systems in the plane were vulnerable to damage. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said 445 DC-10s have been built since 1969, including military models dubbed KC-10s. Plagued by financial losses following the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> crash and heavy competition from other wide-body airliners, the company's <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> unit announced in 1983 it was ending production of the model, except for military tanker versions that were on order. Two passenger planes remained unsold, and the last one of those is to be delivered to <ORGANIZATION> Nigeria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in a few weeks, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. In 1980, a retired <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilot, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, told a news conference he had refused to fly the DC-10 during his last six months as a captain because it was unsafe. He said although the plane has several hydraulic systems, they are interconnected through pumps so that failure of one system jeopardizes the others. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> officials have consistently defended the aircraft as safe, blaming bad publicity for a decline in orders. The big tri-jets also have been involved in several crashes that were blamed on pilot error or problems not related to design or maintenance. In addition to the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> crash, two other DC-10s crashed in 1979. An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zealand </ORGANIZATION> model hit the rocky slopes of a volcano at the edge of <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, killing all 257 people aboard. And 74 people died when the pilot of a <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 landed on a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> runway that was closed for repairs.

<TEXT>
 A labor dispute that began 3 -LCB- months ago as a small walkout at one company has mushroomed into a battle between the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and the coal industry, and turned southwestern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s mountains into a tinderbox of violence. The strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> spread for a time through wildcat strikes to every coal-producing state in the East and led to shooting, rock throwing and thousands of arrests. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has imposed more than $ 4 million in fines on the union for violating an order against civil disobedience by blocking mine entrances and coal-hauling roads. Today the two sides appear as far apart as ever, although a judge has persuaded them to resume talks and most of the wildcat strikes have subsided. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> has headquarters in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and 30 coal operations _ including 20 mines _ in three states. It is a subsidiary of the <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The strike initially involved 1,700 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. In June, 200 <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> miners joined the walkout. All had been working for 14 months without a contract after <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> refused to sign a national agreement reached last year with the <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said the association agreement threatened his company's economic stability. He sought concessions _ in work rules and benefits rather than wages _ that he claimed would save the company $ 5 or more in labor costs per ton of coal. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>, fearing that one successful holdout would lead to other companies to reject the national contract, accused <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> of trying to break the union. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> has hired replacement workers but saw production cut to a third of normal levels during the first two months of the strike. The strike began spreading June 12, after federally mediated negotiations broke down and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> imposed fines and temporarily jailed three union leaders in an effort to stop disruptions of coal traffic. Wildcat sympathy walkouts eventually involved as many as 46,000 miners in 10 Eastern states. Most workers returned to their jobs this week, heeding union orders, but thousands of miners remained off the job in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Pay is not a big issue in the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> dispute. Miners will earn a maximum $ 16.77 an hour over three years under terms the company put into effect on its own June 10. A major issue that sparked harsh words at Wednesday's resumption of talks concerns health and retirement benefits for miners. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> wants to pull out of a national retirement fund and replace it with a plan only for its 560 retirees covered by the plan. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> says that would jeopardize medical benefits for 6,000 pensioners, <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the 130,000 pensioners covered by the national fund. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> also wants the right to require overtime and Sunday work. The union further accuses <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> of threatening job security by seeking permission to hire outside contractors to perform jobs that have been handled by <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members. The company contends it needs a seven-day work week and other flexibility to meet competition from non-union and foreign coal producers. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's 15th largest coal producer but its largest exporter. Job security is a touchy issue because of the increasing mechanization of mining that has seen <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> membership drop to 85,000 from 144,000 in 1980 and a peak of 400,000 during World War II. Union miners produce only a little more than a third of the nation's coal, down from 70 percent in 1970 The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> represents about 45 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coal miners. Although the judge succeeded in getting <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> to resume talks Wednesday, the agreement to resume negotiations showed how far apart, and bitterly divided, the two sides remain. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> was allowed to continue claiming that talks are at an impasse, which keeps its self-imposed contract terms in effect. The union was allowed to preserve its claim that <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> failed to bargain in good faith, holding open the possibility that strikers will get their jobs back once the dispute ends. The dispute marks the second time in as many <ORGANIZATION> BCOA </ORGANIZATION> contracts that the union has fought a coal company to sign a labor agreement. In December 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> ended a 15-month strike against the <ORGANIZATION> A.T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that started when the Richmond-based <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> left to its subsidiaries whether to sign the pact. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> insisted that <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>, as the parent, sign for its holdings. At its peak, the walkout involved 2,000 union miners in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Most <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> subsidiaries eventually reached a contract with the union after obtaining limited concessions.

 Authorities evacuated 1,500 tourists and banned new visitors from the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>, where troops have been unable to halt a bloody feud between rival ethnic groups, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media said today. Armed bands of Georgians and Abkhazians continued to roam the roads in the resort area 870 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Authorities declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew in the region on Tuesday and by today had confiscated more than 2,500 firearms, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said. But the report said `` attacks on citizens, policemen, and army servicemen'' continued Wednesday night in the Abkhazian capital of <LOCATION> Sukhumi </LOCATION>. Soviet news reports said <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> troops and police were confiscating weapons from rioters, but <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, reported today that <LOCATION> Sukhumi </LOCATION> police had to return some firearms to fear-stricken residents. The paper said police were forced to `` give way to the demands of people tortured by fear and rumors, who surrounded the district <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> building and demanded the return of their hunting weapons for self-defense.'' The violence has claimed at least 18 lives since it began Saturday in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>, a 3,320-mile autonomous region in the southern Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> reported today that 339 people have been injured. Georgians outnumber Abkhazians 240,000 to 90,000 in the region and both sides claim discrimination by the other. Many Abkhazians demand that it be designated a 16th Soviet republic. Authorities banned visitors to the region, where millions of tourists vacation every year, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said today. It said that 1,500 people were flown out in a 24-hour period ending today. The violence has halted road and rail transportation. More than 120 people have died in ethnic unrest in the past month in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s southern republics of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>, armed rioters traveling in cars have attacked troops and citizens for the purpose of seizing weapons, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Rioters have attacked a hydroelectric dam and shot up two trains. With strikes widespread in <LOCATION> Sukhumi </LOCATION>, food supplies have been interrupted and long bread lines form each morning, <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said. Rules for citizens under the state of emergency forbid large street gatherings, ban the use of private cars and require all firearms to be surrendered to authorities. The order also includes an 11 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew.

<HEAD>EDS: RETRANSMITTING to fix category code.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The infant mortality rate in the nation's capital jumped to more than twice the national average last year, largely due to an increase in drug abuse among pregnant women, city officials say The District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> saw 23.2 infant deaths per 1,000 births in 1988, the highest level since 1980 and more than double the national average of 9.9 deaths per 1,000 births, the city reported Wednesday. The new statistics represented a substantial increase over the 1987 rate of 19.6 deaths per 1,000 births. `` It's as if ... we've been hit by a hurricane that government ca n't control,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's a tremendous amount of drug abuse among women of childbearing age.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tomkins </ORGANIZATION> said the city expected an increase, but not one so dramatic. `` It was kind of a shock,'' she said. The district's rise in infant mortality followed several years of modest success in curbing what has long been identified as one of the district's biggest health problems. Until 1988, the infant mortality rate had been relatively stable for four years, and had declined slightly in 1987. <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has made infant mortality a major part of its health care agenda. But the city's efforts have been overwhelmed by the crack cocaine epidemic, which has swamped hospitals with the babies of drug addicts. Women who use drugs often give birth to infants with low birth weights who have an increased likelihood of dying before they reach their first birthdays.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is praising <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s decision to purchase <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighter jets but indicates the sensitive topic of co-production of the sophisticated fighters has n't been resolved. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> met with reporters Wednesday after completing the annual series of talks with his South Korean counterpart, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoon </PERSON>. `` I would like to get the best deal that we can,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said when asked about the issue.

 New taxes are needed to pay for programs to improve education, public health and technology, economists told a congressional panel. Nobel Prize-winning economist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> said lawmakers intent on debating the federal deficit are ignoring the basic need for investment in people. <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> joined 326 other economists in signing a statement Wednesday saying that failure to increase investment in such things as education, public health, transportation and technology `` will have a crippling effect on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future competitiveness.''

 Capitalizing on Israeli frustration over the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising, <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> has moved into a strong position in the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and challenged Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. Six years ago <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> was disgraced and forced to resign as defense minister for failing to prevent the massacre of more than 800 Palestinians by Lebanese Christians who were allowed into Israeli-encircled refugee camps in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, 61, has fought his way out of the political wilderness, assuring Israelis he knows how to crush the 19-month Palestinian uprising, which has claimed 570 Arab and 37 Israeli lives. Speaking in the Israeli-annexed <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> this week, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> suggested one way to improve the situation was to `` liquidate'' <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials. The comment was criticized by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as unhelpful to peace efforts. But at home, his tough talk is increasingly welcomed by Israelis frustrated by the violence. `` We are at a historic crossroads and in the absence of a national consensus about which road to take, the extremists gain the upper hand,'' said <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the situation continues getting worse, the people will grow more extremist and feel they are in a time of national emergency. In emergency conditions there is no room for realpolitik,'' said <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON>, a former head of military intelligence who like <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> was forced to resign after the 1982 massacre. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, minister of trade and industry in the coalition Cabinet, demonstrated his power at a party convention earlier this month in which he forced <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to tack hard-line conditions onto his peace initiative. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s restraints angered Palestinians and drew expressions of concern from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, worried that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s ability to compromise had been curtailed. The conditions included a demand that the uprising be halted before <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan for Palestinian elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> is implemented and a stipulation that Jewish settlements would continue to be built in the territories. The move almost triggered the breakup of the 8-month-old coalition with Vice Premier <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> threatening to quit unless the conditions were abandoned. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, the most charismatic and controversial figure in <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, has made no secret of the fact that he wants the party leadership. Some analysts are now viewing him as a serious contender for the first time. `` Suddenly <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> looks strong and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> weak,'' said <PERSON> Nahum </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnea </PERSON>, a political columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> daily </ORGANIZATION> and former editor of the left-wing <PERSON> Koteret </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashit </PERSON> magazine. `` There's no doubt that he -LRB- <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> -RRB- is now dictating the party's policy. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s comeback has generated tension between the two men. Their dispute broke into the open today, with two major <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> newspapers _ <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> _ reporting that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was considering firing <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> declined direct comment on the reports. He suggested the premier was seeking to avoid splits in his party and, at the same time, deter internal threats to his peace plan. `` The prime minister is concerned about the unity of the Likud. He has a high tolerance threshold and tries to see things in their broadest sense,'' <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said. `` He intends to continue advancing the peace process. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> is only one of 11 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- ministers.'' According to the two newpapers, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> complained at a meeting Wednesday of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leaders meeting that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had not advised him about the latest contacts between ministers and Palestinians. `` I can not tell you anything, you leak everything you get your hands on,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> replied, and also accused <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> of `` sowing bad blood and hatred among us.'' `` I can only laugh at your words,'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> was quoted as saying, to which <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> reportedly responded: `` He who laughs last laughs best and I do n't want to speak to you.'' `` No personal attacks or threats to fire me will keep me from demanding an end to the murder of Jews in the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said afterward in a fiery interview on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. He accused the government of devoting too little time to discussing the uprising, and world pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to speak to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> there is a tough ongoing debate on this subject, and there they are n't being murdered ever day. And here just anything goes?,'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said. Despite his irascible style, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> has strong public confidence. A poll of 1,206 Israelis conducted in May by the independent <ORGANIZATION> Modiin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ezrachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> showed 44.4 percent had more confidence in <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s ability to quell the uprising than in any other leader. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> won only 25.4 percent support in the poll. `` I would n't necessarily use tougher measures, only different ones,'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> told a reporter recently.

<HEAD>Shamir Aide Confirms Bush Letter, Claims It Was Supportive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> today confirmed that the premier received a letter from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> condemning Jewish settlement building in the occupied lands as an obstacle to peace. The spokesman, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, also said that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had sent a written response rejecting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s contention and saying he believed that the settlements should have nothing to do with peace efforts. But <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> denied a report that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, in the letter of last month, to abandon hopes of a `` greater <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The report, carried by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to halt settlement building in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio also carried the report. <ORGANIZATION> NPR </ORGANIZATION> also quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as reiterating a remark Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> made to pro-Israeli lobbyists on May 22 that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> give up ideas of annexing the disputed territories. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> declined direct comment on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s letter, `` that all sounds like <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. policy.'' Ahimeir, interviewed by telephone, confirmed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had written <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> at the end of June. He declined to quote directly from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s letter, but described its contents as `` friendly, most positive,'' and supportive of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s peace initiative. In the letter `` he said nothing on the subject of a greater land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said. `` He made no mention of it. The letter, which we received about a month ago is friendly and supports the Israeli peace initiative and the government's peace efforts.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, did reiterate longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objections to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s construction of Jewish towns and villages in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said. Since seizing the disputed lands in the 1967 Middle East War, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has built more than 130 of these enclaves, which are home to about 70,000 Israelis. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials maintain the settlements run counter to the U.S.-backed formula for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to give up occupied land in exchange for peace. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s letter said these `` settlements are an obstacle to the peace process,'' <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> summarized it as saying. Paraphrasing <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s response, <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> totally rejects this view, and so he replied. He -LRB- <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> -RRB- believes that settlements have nothing whatsoever to do with his peace initiative.''

<HEAD>Film Board Closes Meeting to Curb Confusion About Hollywood's Greatest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A panel instructed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to name <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s 25 greatest movies went behind closed doors to debate the merits of films such as `` The Grapes of Wrath'' and `` Citizen <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>.'' Wednesday's meeting was closed to the public over the protests of reporters from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION>, an observer said. <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, an attorney for the librarian of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> charged with overseeing the selections, said the meeting was conducted secretly to dispel public confusion about the panel's work and to promote `` spirited discussion.'' `` There was nothing Machiavellian in the decision to close the meeting,'' said <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>. `` My personal feeling is that they did n't want to hurt any filmmaker's feelings while discussing the merits of one picture over another,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>, a film reviewer and reporter for <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION>. `` They did n't want to be associated with critical comments about people that they work with.'' The meeting had been billed as a public discussion of recommendations the board would make to the librarian of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the first 25 films to be protected under the National Film Preservation Act of 1988. The act, drafted in response to outcries about the practice of coloring old black-and-white movies, stipulates that a panel of experts select 25 titles each year for a national film register. Selected films can still be colored, but the act requires that they're labeled as having been altered without the participation of the original makers of the film. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, composed of representatives of 13 film groups, began meeting in a public session at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Chairwoman <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanin </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, moved to close the meeting to the public after almost 1 -LCB- hours. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said the board had already satisfied requirements under the act to hold two public meetings and was under no legal obligation to continue meeting in public session. Instead of reaching agreement on a list Wednesday, <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said each board member would compose his or her own personal list and submit it to the librarian of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON>. Then <PERSON> Billington </PERSON> will make the final decision, announcing the choices in September, he said. The move to a secret session was especially perplexing as board members had discussed the nominations publicly prior to the meeting. In preliminary polling, 57 movies were nominated by at least two of 13 members of the preservation board. The leader was `` The Grapes of Wrath'' with eight votes. `` Casablanca'' and `` It's a Wonderful Life'' each drew seven votes; `` The Best Years of Our Lives,' ` `` Citizen Kane'' and `` On the Waterfront'' all received six votes. `` They just made this decision at their luncheon today, and they did n't tell anybody about it,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokita </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> who had volunteered to handle publicity for the board.

<HEAD>Huge Crime Syndicate Holds Quiet Ceremony For New Boss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police claimed a victory today as the huge <ORGANIZATION> Yamaguchi-gumi </ORGANIZATION> organized crime syndicate abandoned plans for an elaborate inauguration for its new boss, opting instead for a quiet gathering at its headquarters. `` Our pressure and hard work paid off,'' said a police official in <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION>, a port city in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> where the 21,000-member gang is based. He said police around the country had requested hotels and large banquet halls not to accept reservations from the gang, which, with no where else to go, finally had to hold the ceremony in a large room on the second floor of its headquarters building. The official, who requested anonymity, said about 300 police officers surrounded the building, located on a hill in an expensive residential area, as 105 gangsters attended the two-hour fete. He said there were no arrests. When new boss <PERSON> Yoshinori </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Masahisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Takenaka </PERSON>, was inauguarated in <LOCATION> Naruto </LOCATION> on the southern island of <ORGANIZATION> Shikoku </ORGANIZATION> in July 1984, about 1,000 police were mobilized. More than 300 gangsters, many dressed in black suits or kimono, attended, although no incidents were reported. In 1985, <PERSON> Takenaka </PERSON> was killed in a leadership dispute that divided the gang into two rival camps. More than two dozen deaths and 315 shootings made the ensuing conflict the bloodiest ever in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s underworld During today's ceremony, <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> is believed to have received three `` treasures'' symbolic of his post, a tradition mocking the three sacred treasures that have been passed down from emperor to emperor for centuries. `` We do n't expect anything to change under <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>,'' the officer said. `` And we will keep up our pressure on the gang.'' <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, 48, heads the powerful Yama-ken gang, based in <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION>. The gang is the largest within the Yamaguchi-gumi, and claims a membership of 3,000. Police estimate there are nearly 90,000 gangsters, or yakuza, in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and say nearly half are associated with the three biggest syndicates _ the <ORGANIZATION> Yamaguchi-gumi </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sumiyoshi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rengo </ORGANIZATION> and the Inagawa-kai. Leaders of the <LOCATION> Inagawa-kai </LOCATION>, based in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> area, attended today's ceremony, demonstrating their close relationship with the Yamaguchi-gumi. <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> is the fifth boss of the gang, which was founded by <PERSON> Harukichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> in 1915. When the gang was founded, it had only 50 members. Underworld syndicates often keep a high profile by posting signs outside their offices, and the Yamaguchi-gumi headquarters is a well-known <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION> landmark. Syndicates are involved in extortion, illicit gambling and the drug and sex trades. They also commonly operate in construction, real estate, money laundering and entertainment. Their activities are mainly limited to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but they are known to buy guns and drugs from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> for sale here. Police estimate the total underworld income at $ 15 billion annually. Gang members have complex `` family'' relations cemented by rituals, often patterned on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s indigenous Shinto religion, where rice wine is sipped to seal vows of fidelity. <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> on May 18 completed his wine-sipping ceremony with the gang's top leaders. Later that month, he was convicted of assault and given a 10-month suspended sentence.

 In airports in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, people grieved over the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 crash. In a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> airport, some who grieved before came to console. Flight 232, headed to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> crashed with 293 aboard Wednesday while attempting an emergency landing in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. More than half survived. Moments after hearing about the crash, four people who lost relatives in one of the world's worst airline disasters rushed to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to offer consolation. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslowski </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Norma </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Haddonfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, lost their 30-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, when a terrorist's bomb blew up <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 on Dec. 21, killing 259 aboard and 11 people in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, where the wreckage fell. Two others joined the couple at the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> airport. `` The purpose of our visit is to comfort the families, to support those people who wonder if they're family members are alive,'' <PERSON> Maslowski </PERSON> said. On Wednesday, though, their message reached no relatives of those aboard the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> flight. <PERSON> Maslowski </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> officials told him no one waiting for passengers had reported to the airport. `` It makes it all dredged up again,'' said <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslowski </PERSON> of their mission. `` It's horrible.'' <PERSON> Maslowski </PERSON> said the relatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> victims have formed a network of more than 400 people who are prepared to rush to airports to console anyone waiting for a plane that had crashed. In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> employees escorted 25 to 30 visibly shaken relatives past ranks of reporters and television cameras. The media were not allowed into the VIP area. United officials at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> opened a lounge for families of those aboard the flight. One woman entered crying, her fingertips at her mouth. Two men leaving refused to speak with a reporter, one swearing as he brushed by. Outside the room, 20 police officers and <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> security guards stood by the entrance. Some at the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> airports had news to celebrate. Rabbi <PERSON> Avrohom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brownstein </PERSON> and his wife burst out of the VIP room in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> where relatives of passengers on the plane had gathered. They had just heard their 9-year-old son, <PERSON> Yisroel </PERSON>, had survived with a fractured arm and minor burns. `` He's OK. He always wanted to have a broken arm anyway. We just talked to him on the phone and he's OK,'' <PERSON> Brownstein </PERSON> said. United officials in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> told <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulmann </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, that his sister, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Randa </PERSON>, and her young son, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, had only minor scratches from the crash. `` I think it's a miracle,'' <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulmann </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is trying to balance the pro-Arab point of view of a documentary to be aired during a special about the Palestinian uprising, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. PBS is spending $ 150,000 in additional documentary material and analysis to accompany `` Days of Rage: The Young Palestinians,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. The film, which cost $ 180,000 to make last summer, has stirred protest for being pro-Palestinian. Many journalists and critics who have seen `` Days of Rage'' say it is one-sided but provides a perspective unusual for American television. The 90-minute film about the uprising, known as the intifada, has been shown in several screenings across the country. After one postponement, it is scheduled for nationwide viewing Sept. 6 during a PBS special called `` Intifada: The Palestinians and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Two other `` minidocumentaries'' _ one on the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> presence in the occupied territories and the other on human rights abuses _ will be broadcast during the 2 -LCB- - hour special <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin-Trout </PERSON>, the film's producer and director, called the decision to develop additional footage `` intellectually dishonest.'' But she said a meeting Wednesday with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharnik </PERSON>, who is producing the extra programming, was `` cordial.'' <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON>, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said after seeing the film this week that it is `` an inaccurate, biased documentary which lacks historical or present perspective.'' He said PBS is acting irresponsibly in showing it. <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Giamassi </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for public television station <ORGANIZATION> WNET </ORGANIZATION>, said about 70 percent of the 2,500 letters the station has received protested the planned broadcast.

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> demanded today that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> not arrest a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> college student who violated a ban on visits to the communist north and now wants to return home, officials said today. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> insisted that South Korean Prime Minister <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-hoon </PERSON> give a public assurance that 20-year-old Im Su-kyong may return home as a free citizen through the border village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, officials said. `` If she is arrested and persecuted, North-South relations will be further aggravated, creating a grave obstacle in the road to peaceful unification,'' the message from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said the message was relayed in a telephone call to South Korean Unification Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong-koo </PERSON>. It was not immediately known whether <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would allow Miss Im to cross the border. There have been few mutually acceptable crossings between the enemy nations since they were divided at the end of World War II. Park Jyun-kyu, chairman of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has warned that any North Korean attempt to send the student back to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> `` will raise havoc on the present military status quo at the demarcation line.'' The Demilitarized Zone runs through the middle of the truce village. Also today, <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> chief Son Song-pil sent a telephone message to his South Korean counterpart requesting `` immediate steps to guarantee personal safety for Miss Im.'' The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government has announced that Miss Im, a radical student leader attending <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hankuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, would be arrested when she returned from the north and charged with violating national security law. She defied the government's ban on unauthorized travel to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and traveled by air via <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to attend the July 1-8 World Festival for Youth and Students in the North's capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> At a news conference in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, she said she wanted to return home through the border to symbolize a unified <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and planned to do so on July 27, the anniversary of the cease-fire that ended the 1950-53 Korean War. That is also the last day of a planned July 20-27 peace march aimed at drawing national and international support for unification of the peninsula. Organizers said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on July 6 that the march would include about 100 foreigners and would be held simultaneously in both countries, with the two groups meeting at the border in <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> regards the march as a pro-communist vehicle to stir up unrest and tightened immigration proceedures at all ports of entry to block foreigners who might try to participate. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> prohibits foreigners from engaging in political activity. Riot police were deployed today at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Halla </LOCATION> on the southern island of <LOCATION> Cheju </LOCATION> where the march was scheduled to begin, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the South Korean news agency. Only journalists and tourists showed up, the agency said.

The show was soon syndicated and by early 1988 was being shown in most major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television markets. But ratings began to slip last spring as <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> was involved in a series of highly publicized incidents. Those included charges that he was involved in a scheme to sell shares of a non-existent gold mine and an incident in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> airport bathroom, in which he claimed he was attacked by skinheads and a Nazi swastika was painted on his face. Airport police called the attack a publicity stunt.

<HEAD>Court Concludes Deliberations in Palme Murder Trial</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS background. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court today ended deliberations in the trial of a man accused of the 1986 killing of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> and ordered the defendant held in custody until the verdict is published next week. The announcement was a strong indication that <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> had been found guilty of shooting Palme. Had the verdict been innocent, he would have been ordered released immediately. The <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement, however, did not necessarily mean he would be sentenced on the charge of first-degree murder. If judged to be the killer, <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> could be sent for psychiatric examination with the possibility of committal in a closed mental institution. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> was tried by a panel of two judges and six lay jurors, all with an equal say in determining the defendant's innocence or guilt. `` The deliberations are over,'' said court spokesman <PERSON> Bertil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagberg </PERSON>. `` The defendant shall remain in custody.'' <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, a 42-year-old with a history of drug and alcohol abuse, denied shooting <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, and claimed he was 17 miles away at the time of the Feb. 28, 1986 shooting. The verdict will be published on July 27, the court said. The jury's final session lasted more than two hours. It was their fourth meeting since the four-week trial concluded July 10. A simple majority of the eight-member panel would be enough for a guilty verdict. A tie vote would mean acquittal. Prosecutor <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> <PERSON> Helin </PERSON> cautioned against drawing a firm conclusion about the verdict from the court's announcement, but said `` normally this would point to a guilty verdict.'' <PERSON> Helin </PERSON> said he assumed <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> would appeal a guilty verdict to the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Defense attorney <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Liljeros </PERSON> said his client was `` very disappointed.'' <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> was arrested last Dec. 14, nearly three years after <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was shot in the back from close range after leaving a movie with his wife <PERSON> Lisbeth </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> identified <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> in court as the man she saw standing a few feet away immediately after he husband fell with a fatal gunshot wound. Though she saw no weapon, other witnesses testified that no one else was near enough to have fired the shot. The defense challenged Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s reliability more than three years after the event, and noted the lack of a motive, murder weapon or other forensic evidence to link <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> with the shooting.

 In the moments after the crash of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232, passengers were upside down, belted in their seats. Some freed others. Some could rescue only themselves. Passengers spoke of the pilot's warnings before Wednesday's deadly crash, but they mostly remembered the impact and escaping the fractured fuselage More than half of the 293 people on board the flight survived the crash, some walking away with only bruises. The three-member cockpit crew survived, too. The pilot warned passengers about 20 minutes before the crash that `` it would likely be a rough landing,'' several survivors recalled. Among the passengers was another pilot, who put a pillow over his head as the plane crashed and cartwheeled three times just off an unused runway at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` We rolled upside down, and inside out and every which way. The plane broke into three pieces, and bodies all over the place, hanging upside down,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Martz </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` I unfastened my belt and dropped a little ways. ... Finally I saw what I thought was an open window, but there were flames. I said, ` To hell with it, I'm going for it' and I went through the flames. I ca n't believe it, there were people with feet missing and arms missing, it's the goddamndest thing I've ever seen in my life.'' In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 33 tired and somber survivors completed their journey early this morning on a chartered <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight. Several wore neck braces, one had a bandaged eye and at least two people still wore dirt - or blood-stained clothing Police escorted them through <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, keeping reporters away. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Belliveau </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, spoke to reporters, though, saying the fire that erupted after the crash `` scared us all. Because the fire was really obvious. I mean there was smoke everywhere.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Belliveau </PERSON> said the professionalism of the flight attendants and the pilot's calm voice convinced her that the plane would be brought in safely. `` We thought we were going to make it and when he said ` brace, brace, brace' for the second time we really thought we were going to make it.'' In <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Surge </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said when it was apparent the plane was in trouble passenger <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, went over to sit with 8-year-old <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Radtke </PERSON> of Prairie View, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, who was traveling alone. The plane `` hit and bounced, then flipped and spun around so we ended up upside down. I let go and asked <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> for the kid'' and shoved him out, <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> was shaking but thankful to be alive. `` I thought I was going to die,'' he said, clutching a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> button and a pair of plastic pilot's wings. As the plane filled with smoke shortly after the crash, <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, saw a way out. `` God opened a hole in the basement, and I pushed a little girl out and grabbed another and kept pulling them out until they did n't come no more,'' he said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Landsberger </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Caldwell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said after the plane stopped sliding, `` we let ourselves down and started walking towards this large open area at the back of the plane. `` We just all walked out into a cornfield. I was a little dazed. I do know that I probably stepped on some people or something as we were walking out, but I knew if we stopped we'd all get bottled up.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Benham </PERSON>, 37, a <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, restaurateur, said the evacuation was orderly: `` There was not a lot of panic. Only when I got into the cornfield did I look back and see other parts of the plane burning.'' Later, <PERSON> Landsberger </PERSON> was unsure of his plans. `` I'd really like to go have a beer and go to bed,'' he said. `` I do n't know what I'm going to do. But I'm not going to walk back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. I'll probably fly.''

<TEXT>
 A Rembrandt drawing stolen 10 years ago from a <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> museum is on its way back to <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> today after being identified by an art expert at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction house. The unsigned artwork came to the auction house from a European dealer, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s spokeswoman <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said Wednesday. The drawing was consigned to the dealer by a client who bought it for an undisclosed sum several years ago as a `` good anonymous drawing,'' she said. The auction house routinely tries to attribute all the unsigned works it receives for auction. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacoby </PERSON>, who heads <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s Old Masters department, got this one on June 16 `` I knew right away it had a very good shot at being a Rembrandt,'' she said. `` I felt the drawing on stylistic grounds was very Rembrandtesque and also very high quality.'' Research quickly confirmed her hunch. `` After my initial elation that it was a Rembrandt, I read through the catalog entry, to the bottom line, where it said, ` Current ownership, <ORGANIZATION> Amsterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rembrandt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>.' That sent alarm bells ringing and I called our counsel before I did anything else,'' said <PERSON> Jacoby </PERSON>. `` We contacted them to inquire and they informed us the drawing was stolen 10 years ago. I think they were very surprised and very pleased.'' The Rembrandt, removed from its original frame, was mounted on two pieces of glass with tape around the edges. The 3-by-5 inch, double-sided drawing is in pen and ink on handmade paper. One side depicts a child, believed to be <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Rombartus </PERSON>; the other a sleeping woman, thought to be his wife, <PERSON> Saskia </PERSON> `` A drawing of such personal and biographical interest has added appeal'' and could have fetched more than $ 100,000 at auction, said <PERSON> Jacoby </PERSON>. The drawing, which was stolen in May 1979, has been handed over to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> and is on its way to the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> museum, said Ms. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>.

 Howitzer shells and rockets rained on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors today in one of the fiercest overnight duels between Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army gunners in 18 weeks of fighting. Police said four people were killed and 49 wounded. The shells hit residential buildings on both sides of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, starting hundreds of fires and covering the city with a blanket of rubble and glass shards Streets were full of cars reduced to smoldering piles of metal. Tongues of flame shot up in the sky and smoke billowed from blasted buildings. Fire brigades were unable to combat blazes due to a shortage of water caused by a power failure. Ambulances, their sirens wailing, sped through the streets to evacuate the latest casualties, which raised the overall toll to 424 killed and 1,741 wounded since the current round of fighting broke out March 8. Several Syrian artillery positions in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seafront <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Mreisseh </PERSON> boulevard took direct hits and a police spokesman said many Syrian soldiers were killed or wounded. `` We do n't have a breakdown because the Syrian command does not report its losses to us,'' said the spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations. At least eight Syrian army trucks loaded with rocket ammunition and gasoline were gutted, according to a Lebanese eyewitness. One 155mm howitzer shell crashed at a road intersection across the street from the Italian Embassy in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wardieh </LOCATION> district, wrecking a cluster of chic boutiques and the city's most fashionable florist, <LOCATION> Florelle </LOCATION>. The barrage, according to police, reached an intensity of about 30 shells per minute at times. Police said at least 700 buildings and shops were hit in the deadly barrage, which also inflicted damage on more than 5,000 cars. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> vying for power with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded with the leaders of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> to speed up efforts aimed at resolving <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s crisis. In a cable, <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said: `` <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and its surroundings witnessed a horrible night of barbaric random shelling. `` On behalf of the innocent people of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, its children, women and elderly I plead with you to speed up your humanitarian mission,'' he said. The three heads of state were assigned by an Arab summit in May to find a settlement. Their cease-fire calls have been ignored by the warring factions. `` May someone call the fire brigade. We want an ambulance too,'' a woman screamed from the 11-story <PERSON> Kaaki </PERSON> building in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Zokak </PERSON> <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON> district as fire raged in the top three floors `` Telephone lines are down,'' a man shouted back from a nearby building. `` Have faith in God, we're coming to help you.'' The 10th-floor apartment of <PERSON> Fawzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rida </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kaaki </LOCATION> building took two direct hits from 107mm rockets early today. <PERSON> Rida </PERSON>, 37, a Shiite Moslem, said, `` The explosions shattered the walls and pushed the furniture out of the apartment.'' `` I stretched a hand to open the door, but there was no door left,'' he said, his eyes brimming with tears. `` We've nothing left except the night dresses we are wearing.'' Residents throughout the city rushed to basements shortly after the shelling duel broke out late Wednesday night. `` There is no district in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the surrounding mountains that was n't targeted by the shelling,'' said a police spokesman, who can not be named in line with standing regulations. The current round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war began this spring two days after Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> took the measure to salvage about $ 100 million in lost customs dues annually. The Syrians and their allies retaliated by blockading the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command, speaking on condition of anonymity, accused the Syrians of starting the latest barrage by shelling the coastline north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to prevent three vegetable-laden ships from docking at Christian ports. The Syrians have been shelling the Christian-controlled coast north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> almost daily for more than a month to prevent <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from receiving war material from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab rival, has declared support to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s `` war of liberation'' against the 40,000 Syrian troops deployed in predominantly Moslem Lebanese provinces under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of failing to achieve their mandate by siding with Moslems against Christians in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is trying to balance the pro-Arab point of view of a documentary to be aired during a special about the Palestinian uprising, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. PBS is spending $ 150,000 in additional documentary material and analysis to accompany `` Days of Rage: The Young Palestinians,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. The film, which cost $ 180,000 to make last summer, has stirred protest for being pro-Palestinian. Many journalists and critics who have seen `` Days of Rage'' say it is one-sided but provides a perspective unusual for American television. The 90-minute film about the uprising, known as the intefadeh, has been shown in several screenings across the country. After one postponement, it is scheduled for nationwide viewing Sept. 6 during a PBS special called `` Intifada: The Palestinians and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Two other `` minidocumentaries'' _ one on the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> presence in the occupied territories and the other on human rights abuses _ will be broadcast during the 2 -LCB- - hour special <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin-Trout </PERSON>, the film's producer and director, called the decision to develop additional footage `` intellectually dishonest.'' But she said a meeting Wednesday with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharnik </PERSON>, who is producing the extra programming, was `` cordial.'' <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON>, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said after seeing the film this week that it is `` an inaccurate, biased documentary which lacks historical or present perspective.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> called in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador today and accused <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of deliberately trying to undermine relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by approving new trade sanctions. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Huaqiu </PERSON>, an assistant to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>, expressed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s indignation and delivered a strong protest to Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, issued a separate protest charging that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` willfully distorted the facts about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s efforts to put an end to turmoil and quell the counterrevolutionary rebellion in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.'' The protests were the latest in a series of recriminations reflecting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> outrage over the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> army's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters and Chinese outrage over any foreign comment on its domestic politics. Relations have deteriorated to their lowest level since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1979. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> separately approved legislative amendments calling for a range of sanctions in addition to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s previous halt to military sales and high-level exchanges. Among other things, both houses called for suspending the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds to support trade with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also called for suspending satellite exports that would be launched by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and for suspending nuclear cooperation. The amendments have yet to be signed into law. `` The two amendments ... slandered and attacked the Chinese government in a groundless manner,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> refused comment on <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>'s response. A separate Foreign Ministry statement read to reporters accused <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of `` pursuing power politics in a deliberate attempt to harm Chinese-U. relations.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 42 <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators signed a letter delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> that predicted `` tremendous'' damage to bilateral relations `` should your government continue on the course of state-sponsored violence and intimidation on which you are embarked.'' But despite both sides' talk of damaged relations, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said neither side wanted to end the relationship altogether. `` There are some -LRB- Chinese -RRB- people, a small group of people, who think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a bad influence and want to see -LRB- the influence -RRB- limited,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. On the American side, he said, there was a sense of disillusionment because in the past, `` there was a kind of culture that said the relationship was special.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly news conference, spokeswoman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Jinhua </PERSON> denied that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> plans to cut economic ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries that have criticized its crackdown. Ms. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> soldiers were `` acting according to their orders and ... performing their normal tasks'' in searching foreign diplomats' cars at checkpoints in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and sometimes sticking guns in their faces. `` Foreigners should abide by the orders issued by the martial law enforcement troops,'' she said when asked if such searches were legal. Military checkpoints go up around <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after midnight, and several diplomats have reported that soldiers searched their cars in apparent violation of international agreements on diplomatic immunity. Ms. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> also maintained that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has not banned sales of all foreign newspapers and magazines in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, although she said she could not name any foreign publications still allowed. Officials went to hotels and stores in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last week and took foreign papers and magazines from newstands. None has been allowed on sale since. `` We do not refuse all foreign books and magazines and newspapers,'' the spokeswoman said. `` But we do not alow those foreign magazines and newspapers whose content interferes in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs and hurts the national feelings of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people to spread unchecked on Chinese soil This is quite natural.'' She refused to comment on the number of people arrested since the crackdown on the protests began, or on persistent reports that fugitive student leader <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> has been arrested.

 <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> today established relations with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, becoming the first nation to have relations with both the Nationalist government in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> and the communist government in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The move was seen as a defeat for communist Chinese foreign policy because it followed <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations and because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> asks countries that recognize it to break relations with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, the tiny island nation in the <LOCATION> Carribean </LOCATION>, established relations with the communist government in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1985. There was no immediate reaction from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>'s move today. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> also used to demand that countries break relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> before establishing ties with <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. But in a break with the past, Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> did not ask <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> to sever ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a condition because `` this is not necessary.'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> decided to recognize <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> after the communists began their crackdown. `` They reviewed their <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> policy and they believed the establishment of official ties with us can help promote world peace and freedom,'' King told a news conference. The international standing of the Nationalists has waned since they lost a civil war to communist forces on the Chinese mainland in 1949. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rapprochement with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the 1970s dealt a further blow to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s status. The number of countries with formal ties to the Nationalist government has dropped from more than 50 in 1949 to 23, while 135 countries recognize <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> would be the 24th country to recognize <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. But since communist Chinese troops launched a crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has taken steps to take advantage of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s loss of international support. <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, with a population of 11,000, is a member of the British <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> and relies on agricultural exports and tourism. In 1983, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> and small force from six <LOCATION> Carribean </LOCATION> nations invaded the island, deposing a Marxist regime.

More than 300 people, many carrying banners and placards denouncing military spending, gathered outside the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office here Wednesday for the auction of the home of <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehler </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Corner </PERSON>. The couple have not paid federal taxes in 12 years to protest the federal government's military spending. <PERSON> Kehler </PERSON> is a founder of the Nuclear Freeze campaign and its first national chairman. One group of protesters offered $ 21,414 worth of food and donated services to the poor. Their canned goods were heaped on a truck next to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> office. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Deters </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Montague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> offered 10 toilet seats, which he asserted would meet the $ 5,100 minimum bid if priced according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Department procurement standards. Other bids included a guided tour of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. All 90 offers were rejected because they did not constitute legal tender, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruttenberg </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The government acquired the home in the northwest <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Colrain </LOCATION> for the minimum bid of $ 5,100. The couple has six months to get their home back by paying $ 27,000 in taxes, <PERSON> Ruttenberg </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Kehler </PERSON> said they would not pay. He also promised that he, his wife and their 9-year-old daughter would not comply with an eviction order. <PERSON> Kehler </PERSON> said he and his wife have filed returns and donated the money owed to local charities and peace groups. They have continued to pay state and local taxes, he said. <PERSON> Ruttenberg </PERSON> said the number of tax resisters protesting military spending has dropped to about 5,000 from about 22,000 in the early 1980s.

 Authorities put <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s top opposition leader, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, under house arrest today after a day of unrest in that country's capital, according to a Western embassy report. The arrest came after police beat protesters Wednesday during a holiday marking national independence. State radio said 44 other people were reported arrested during the protests. Troops of the military government of Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> surrounded Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>'s house in a suburb of the capital, <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, and kept her there, said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity. He got his information from a report of a Western embassy in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> that he would not identify further. `` She tried to surrender herself to the military, but they refused and they forced her back inside,'' said the source. He said a diplomat and Tin Oo, co-leader of Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>'s National League for Democracy, went to see her, but they were turned away Other details were not immediately available. Operators said telephone and telex lines to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> were out of order today. The source said the reason for the arrest of Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, the daughter of a celebrated independence leader, was unclear. He said the government may have used the violence during Wednesday's Martyrs Day ceremonies as a pretext to move against her. He said her arrest may also be linked to those of three members of her party. Authorities accused the three of bombing a government oil refinery earlier this month in an attack that killed three people. Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> is the most vocal critic of the authoritarian government that has ruled under martial law since army commander <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power in a coup in September and killed hundreds of people to crush a nationwide campaign for democracy. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> has pledged to hold a general election by early next year, and Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> say authorities have been increasingly concerned by Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>'s growing popularity. `` <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> has been looking for a confrontation. Now it's happened,'' the source in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, 44, had vowed to lead thousands of people on a march Wednesday to mark the day her father, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, and other <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> independence leaders were assassinated in 1947. She canceled the rally, however, to avoid bloodshed as troops flooded the streets of the capital and erected barricades. The soldiers `` blocked off all the roads and prepared literally a killing field for the people,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> Wednesday before her reported arrest. Witnesses said troops scattered hundreds of student demonstrators who defied martial law. State-run radio reported 44 arrests. Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> said soldiers used sticks to beat some of the 3,000 student protesters in the capital's <LOCATION> Swegondine </LOCATION> district. A Western diplomat, also reached by telephone, said he saw soldiers chase a group of students down a side street, drag some of them out and hit them with sticks before putting 15 to 20 of them into a truck. State radio said Wednesday night more than 1,400 people gathered at seven areas of the city despite martial law. It said they chanted, carried anti-government banners and distributed protest literature while marching. A text of that broadcast was seen in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> today. A heavily-guarded ceremony sponsored by the government was held at the Martyrs Mausoleum without incident Wednesday morning, though most opposition parties boycotted it. Also Wednesday, Briton <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Storey </PERSON>, chief correspondent in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency, said authorities expelled him from the country.

White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s letter, sent before the president went to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on July 9, strongly endorsed Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s statements on the peace process. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to accept territorial compromise and to stop further Jewish settlements in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> confirmed Wednesday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had written <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, saying the letter `` re-emphasized our general position and our desire to continue the peace process.''

<TEXT>
 Strikes by tens of thousands of miners in this Siberian coal region spread to four more of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s coal fields, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The official news agency said coal miners in <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> in the far north, the <LOCATION> Don </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Rostov </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and the Ukrainian industrial center of <LOCATION> Dnepropetrovsk </LOCATION> walked out Wednesday. Miners in the <LOCATION> Karaganda </LOCATION> region in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> today refused to work, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. By evening, 14 mines in the region, home of the country's third-largest coal fields, were reported at a standstill. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said their demands were similar to those of striking miners in the <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> coal basins, who are seeking greater local control over their industries and better wages and living conditions. <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION>, in western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, are the country's two leading coal basins and the strikes amount to the country's worst labor unrest since the 1920s. <LOCATION> Novokuznetsk </LOCATION> is a major city in the <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> region, where the strikes began 10 days ago. The government has acknowledged that living and working conditions for miners in the regions are abysmal and has made general pledges of improvements. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that some miners in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> had returned to work after the government made pay concessions. The government also has promised to send extra meat, butter, sugar, tea, leather shoes, furniture and cars to relieve shortages in the region, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said today. But the newspaper and <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported more disturbances in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> quoted a communist official in the <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Makeyevka </LOCATION> as saying, `` The scale of the strike is growing. Practically all the coal enterprises of the city have stopped work.'' Miners in <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rostov </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dnepropetrovsk </LOCATION> all walked off the job on Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION>, strikers sent a letter to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> asking for an `` urgent resolution of the sharp economic and social problems of the coal sector, and also specific problems of workers of the far north,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Rostov </LOCATION>, miners' economic demands included extra pay for evening and night shifts, longer vacations and an increase in the price of coal to world market prices, the news agency reported. In <LOCATION> Dnepropetrovsk </LOCATION>, which is 150 miles from <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION>, workers' demands mirrored those of <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> miners In <LOCATION> Karaganda </LOCATION>, strikers said they walked out to protest incomplete news accounts of miners' demands in the <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> strikes, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Wednesday the strikes could imperil his reforms and that there were reports of railway workers being urged to strike. He said that if labor trouble spreads, `` We may have to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing'' to overhaul the economy through greater attention to free-market mechanisms. He did not elaborate. Strikes are rare in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and were ended by force before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gained power in March 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> today said that the <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> strike had reached `` a turning point,'' with nine out of 11 mining centers back at work. It was not known how many more employees were back on the job today. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that 24,000 strikers in <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> were back at work and 150,000 remained on strike. State television said Wednesday that the strike in the <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> basin had spread to 70 of its 120 mines, more than triple the previous number, and that mine construction workers had joined. In a report from the <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Yenakiyevo </LOCATION>, television said steel and coke-chemical plants were `` on the verge of a stoppage'' for lack of coal. Earlier reports in the official press had said operations at steel and power plants were affected by short supplies of coal and coke. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the national legislature Wednesday that the strikes had deprived the nation of more than 1 million tons of coal. The government has agreed to most miner demands, including those on pensions and overtime, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. But he said that settling some longer-term issues would take up to a month. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> outlined a concessions package that includes bonus pay to night shifts and for men using jackhammers. Strikers also have complained about poor housing and shortages of consumer goods and food, and the government has made general pledges of improvements in those areas.

 <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tammuz </PERSON>, a prominent Russian-born Israeli author, sculptor and proponent of Jewish-Arab coexistence, has died at age 70. Israeli news reports said his death Wednesday was caused by cancer and that he had kept his illness secret from most of his friends. <PERSON> Tammuz </PERSON> was known as one of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s foremost modern writers whose books contained humorous and introspective portrayals of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s pioneer generation He published dozens of books, short stories and satirical columns in the prestigious Haaretz daily. Among the most popular is a humorous sketch of pioneer days called `` The Life of Elyakum.'' He was also among the leaders of the defunct <ORGANIZATION> Canaanite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which left-wing poets and artists began before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s founding in 1948. The movement sought a way of forging Jewish-Arab cooperation. The Canaanites wanted to build a new `` Hebrew'' nation, as opposed to a Jewish one, to circumvent conflict with the Arabs. The biblical name came from ancient <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION>, the promised land of the Israelites who subjugated it after their flight from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The movement never gained support in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and is now mostly credited for its important role in transforming biblical Hebrew into a modern language. In his last televised interview about a week ago, <PERSON> Tammuz </PERSON> suggested that the 19-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories had reinvigorated his Canaanite beliefs. <PERSON> Tammuz </PERSON> studied history at the <LOCATION> Sorbonne </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1950-51 and later edited `` Art in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' a survey of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> art trends in the 1960s. He was a sculptor and participated in numerous group shows. He designed a monument to fallen Israeli pilots which is now at <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s Independence Park. <PERSON> Tammuz </PERSON> will be buried Thursday in Holon, a suburb of his <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> hometown.

Elected to the newly powerful presidency by the slimmest margin possible, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> now faces the challenge of trying to salvage a crippled economy. His task was exacerbated by strikes in the southern province of <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION>. The strikes eased today with the signing of a new pay agreement, but many workers reportedly rejected it and stayed off the job. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s Communist coalition controls 300 seats in the 560-seat parliament, but because some in the coalition voted against him, a boycott by some opposition legislators may have been the key to <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s win. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, needed 270 votes to win. The final tally was 270-to-233, with 34 abstentions. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and a spokesman for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent congratulatory messages today to <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> is deeply respected in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as the initiator of the policy of national accord and socialist renovation,'' said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s message, transmitted by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in congratulating <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, `` Our only concern is to see the political and economic reform process go forward.'' A commentary in the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> attributed <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s win to what it called a symbolic single vote cast by <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> last week, when he said the president should come from the Communist coalition. It said in a popular vote, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the leader of the Solidarity trade union movement, would have been the winner. `` What then is the result of this election for ordinary people in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, those who stand in lines and with horror think about the landslide of rising prices? Nothing,'' read the commentary. `` But these people will submit their bill to the deputies and senators, to the generals and ministers, and to the president, if the process of rescuing the country from ruin is not started.'' The general, who has has led the country eight years and promises to oversee a transition to democracy, was the only candidate Wednesday. Some Solidarity lawmakers displayed their paper ballots to TV cameras as they voted to show they were against <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. Many of them had been imprisoned during <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s 1981 martial law crackdown on the union. Opposition lawmakers who did not vote said they could not openly endorse <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, but they said defeating him could undermine reforms. `` It is a great relief,'' said opposition Sen. <PERSON> Karol </PERSON> <PERSON> Modzelewski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>. `` We would have been in real trouble if he did not make it.'' As president, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> now constitutionally controls the military and foreign relations and must nominate a prime minister to assemble a new government with parliamentary approval. It is a six-year term. The government will have to contend with a deteriorating economy. Inflation is heading for 160 percent and food shortages are worsening. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said a two-day strike by 11,000 transit workers in the southern province of Katowice ended today with the signing of a new pay agreement that raised hourly pay. But the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> said workers in 10 out of 17 bus depots rejected the agreement and were continuing their strikes. In the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Gdynia </LOCATION>, a strike by shipyard workers ended late Wednesday after one day. `` An ocean of problems is ahead of us,'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> told parliament in a brief, restrained speech moments after taking the oath of office. `` Material conditions ... must dictate the priorities of action. They are more important and urgent than anything else.'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said a new government must be organized `` as soon as possible.'' The Cabinet of Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> already has submitted its resignation, and it is conceivable the next government could be drawn at least partly from the opposition. The election of a president was the last step in meeting accords that Communist authorities forged with Solidarity in April after labor unrest prompted them to seek the cooperation of the opposition. In the course of three months of talks, Solidarity regained its legal status after a seven-year ban; the country's freest elections in 40 years were held; and the opposition won all but one of the parliamentary seats it was allowed to contest. Immediately after the election, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> sent a letter of congratulations to the general, emphasizing that the opposition expects him to continue with democratic reform. `` My wish for you is that the time you are given to perform this office will be a stage in the history of our homeland effectively leading to freedom and democracy and to regaining <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s proper position in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' the message said. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> promised Solidarity lawmakers before the election that he would give up the post of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> first secretary if elected president. It was unclear if he intended to resign immediately or to hold both posts temporarily.

<HEAD>Teacher Union Leaders Express Concern About Growing Teen Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly three-quarters of teacher union leaders say they are increasingly concerned about teen-age violence and gang-related activities, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> reported today. More than 80 percent of those surveyed by the AFT said easy access to drugs was among the factors `` very responsible'' for the problem. Some 65 percent cited easy access to guns. Drug trafficking, lack of parental supervision and lack of employment opportunities were also identified as major factors. The top five solutions favored by the teachers were improved support systems for families, improved community organizations, more money for education and recreation facilities for teen-agers, more stringent gun control laws and mandatory school-site security personnel. Fewer than half of those surveyed favored installing metal detectors in schools, with many citing the enormous cost of such a move. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, president of the AFT affiliate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said school violence is still the exception rather than the rule. But she said 82 percent of survey respondents said teen-age violence is a bigger problem now than it used to be, and `` if that's not a warning, I do n't know what is.'' The 710,000-member AFT represents education personnel in most of the nation's urban areas. For its survey it questioned representatives of its 50 largest locals, the 43 presidents of AFT state units, and the union's 38-member executive council.

<TEXT>
 A former civilian worker for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was convicted today of conspiring with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier to sell American military secrets to East German and Soviet agents. The guilty verdict against <PERSON> Huseyin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON>, 61, was returned by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury after about six hours of deliberations over two days. <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON>, a Turkish-born, naturalized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, was charged with conspiring with Warrant Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to sell classified information to Eastern bloc agents between 1983 and 1988, when <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was stationed in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON> was working as a civilian mechanic at an Army auto shop in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at the time. The trial was held in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was stationed at nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stewart </LOCATION> at the time of his arrest last December. Hall pleaded guilty at a court-martial in March and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. In closing arguments Wednesday, defense lawyer <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was solely to blame for the espionage. `` The evidence you heard is sufficient to convict him -LRB- Hall -RRB-, but not my man,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> is very definitely a guilty man. The man is not capable of being believed.'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> called no witnesses after Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> rested the government's case Wednesday morning. Defense experts say the espionage scheme damaged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence efforts in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Hall worked as an analyst of intercepted radio and telephone traffic and coded messages. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, in his closing argument, contended that the evidence showed overwhelmingly that <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON> was <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s contact, that he carried documents to the Soviets and East Germans and that he returned with money. Before resting his case, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> elicited testimony from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> espionage expert <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> that a `` Dear Friend'' letter found among <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON>'s property in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> included a `` shopping list ... a list of things they would like. ... You would probably be paid the most for it.'' Testimony said <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON>'s fingerprint was found on the unsigned letter. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents testified Tuesday that <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON>'s fingerprints also were on two $ 50 bills found in Hall's truck. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents seized the bills, a phony passport and military intelligence documents at <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s home and from his truck in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, when he was arrested Dec. 20, evidence showed. Other incriminating evidence was taken from <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Belleair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, later the same morning, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents said. Hall appeared in the courtroom during the trial, which began Monday, but did not testify in person. In a videotape played for the jury Tuesday, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Dimitry </PERSON> <PERSON> Droujinsky </PERSON> he was lured into the spy game by money. `` I was n't terribly short of money,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> told the agent, who was posing as a Soviet agent named <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON>. `` I just decided I did n't ever want to worry where my next dollar was coming from. ... What I wanted to be able to do was to afford some of the things I wanted.'' Investigators began probing <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s affairs when evidence showed he was living above his income of $ 20,200.

 Three federal judges have ordered <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> to replace four governing boards with one in a package of sweeping reforms to desegregate the state's 17 public colleges and universities. `` The present scheme for governing education in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> _ three operating boards and one coordinating board _ has perpetuated illegal segregation in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s higher education,'' the judges said Wednesday. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed 15 years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It closely followed recommendations made in May by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, who was appointed by the judges to conduct hearings and write a desegregation plan. The five-year plan would create of a single board to govern higher education, restrict admissions at some universities, limit degree programs most can offer and establish a community college system. Currently, one board governs the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> system, another governs the mostly black <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> system and a third governs the others. All three boards answer to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION> for Higher Education. The court gave the state 30 days to replace the four governing boards with a new 17-member board. The governor will appoint the members, pending <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. The court declined to set a ratio of white-to-black members. The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> board of supervisors will meet July 29 in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> to discuss an appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which could delay the plan's implementation. The plan was recommended by Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> when he took office in 1988. `` The state has won. The people have won. I believe we have <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> and three judges to thank,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s lawyer in the case The order would designate <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> as the unified system's flagship university, with the greatest number of graduate and research programs. It also calls for creation of an intermediate level of institutions _ which includes Southern _ offering significant doctoral and other graduate programs, and for gradually merging the <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> law school and the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law school, both in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. The state's remaining four-year colleges would be designated comprehensive universities with limited graduate or research missions and less-selective or open admissions. The order was written by 5th U.S. Circuit Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisdom </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> and District Judge <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Wicker </PERSON>. Reaction to the order varied. `` I would think that the -LRB- merger of -RRB- Southern law school is a real big problem for the board and for the black community. It's a matter that needs to be modified,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, a black <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> lawyer who represents the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> system. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the plan has great potential to desegregate. `` I think a single system and a selective admissions policy in some schools to move students around will help desegregate.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeithen </PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> last year and was the first governor to champion desegregation, was skeptical. `` I do n't think it's going to work. For the life of me, I do n't know any way to make a white go to <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION> or a black go to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Tech,'' <PERSON> McKeithen </PERSON> said, referring to two state colleges

 Saudi financier <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> landed in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jail after being extradited from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and pleading innocent to charges of helping <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> plunder $ 100 million from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> said at Wednesday's hearing that he `` would n't dream of setting bail'' until <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>'s worth is verified. Once among the world's richest men, <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> was said to be the middleman in the Iran-Contra deal. The former fugitive, handcuffed and wearing a green walking suit, did not talk with reporters before leaving <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents. But in a statement released by his lawyer, <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> said he intends to contest the charges and is confident that `` my innocence will be clearly established.'' <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morvillo </PERSON>, had asked that bail be set no higher than the $ 5 million bond granted Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>'s assets have dwindled recently as various holdings have been sold. `` I read in the newspapers, like everyone else, that he's a very rich man, but I do n't know that,'' the judge said. `` I think your honor can assume that he's an enormously wealthy man,'' <PERSON> Morvillo </PERSON> said. Instead of jail, <PERSON> Morvillo </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> be put under house arrest at his luxury apartment on Fifth Avenue. He said <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> could pay for private security guards deputized by the court to watch him. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> laughed at the idea but said he would keep in mind <PERSON> Morvillo </PERSON>'s arguments in favor of bail. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> opposed bail and house arrest, saying he had learned that creditors were about to foreclose on the apartment. In October, a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, the Marcoses, five other people and the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Overseas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The Marcoses were charged with stealing millions from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to buy real estate and art in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> allegedly posed as the owner of some of the assets as a cover. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, 53, had been jailed in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> since his April 18 arrest at a luxury hotel in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> officials denied extradition for racketeering and conspiracy charges because they're not recognized under Swiss law He was arraigned Wednesday on mail fraud and obstruction of justice. He faces up to five years in jail and a $ 250,000 fine. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, who once traveled the globe in his private yacht and plane, spent the last three months in a 30-square-foot prison cell fighting extradition. He is said to have been a major financier and middleman of the Iran-Contra affair, in which proceeds of secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were channeled to rebels fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. He has acknowledged a role in the deal and said he lost $ 10 million on it. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> also has been named in several kickback scandals, and has had financial problems that led one of his companies to file for protection under bankruptcy law. His arrest in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> marked the first time that he was ever jailed. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic note asking that <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> be arrested cited four buildings in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and a collection of paintings that disappeared from a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> museum, Swiss authorities said. <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>'s lawyers two weeks ago announced they planned to appeal the extradition. But the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> changed his mind at a recent hearing. His lawyers gave no explanation for the change of heart.

His hard-line fundamentalist group is at odds with <PERSON> Shaoib </PERSON>'s faction, which also is based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shaoib </PERSON> said the 30 guerrillas, seven of whom were key Jamiat commanders, were returning July 9 from a military strategy meeting with <PERSON> Jamiat </PERSON>'s key commander, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON>, in the northern province of <LOCATION> Takhar </LOCATION>. They were ambushed by <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> commander <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON>, and five were killed immediately and 25 were later executed, <PERSON> Shaoib </PERSON> alleged. Sixteen `` mutilated'' bodies were returned to Jamiat forces in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Shaoib </PERSON>. `` All those who were involved should be tried ... <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> gave the order so he is involved,'' <PERSON> Shaoib </PERSON> said in a news release. Guerrilla sources said the killings are part of a bloody power struggle that has been going on between the two guerrilla groups in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since the civil war began 11 years ago. The Moslem insurgents are fighting to oust the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and set up an Islamic republic. Until February, Soviet troops were helping the Afghan government troops. They withdrew under a U.N.-mediated accord. Scores of rebels have been killed in clashes between the guerrilla groups, according to rebel sources.

Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the committee was taking no action `` on anything on the calendar today,'' but added `` there was a strong likelihood'' the panel could meet next week The panel's first step in an investigation of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., who engineered a controversial book deal, would be to order a preliminary inquiry The committee's ranking Republican, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, said before the panel's closed-door meeting, `` I do n't think there will be a decision on any of the issues before the August recess,'' which begins in about two weeks <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, who said the committee has three or four items on its agenda, also said he has received a letter from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concerning Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill. On Wednesday, three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members asked the committee to investigate an accusation that <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> sexually assaulted a Peace Corps volunteer while on an official trip to <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> letter was `` an assertion of what they believe to be the facts.'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> filed the complaint that led to the investigation of former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who resigned in June after the committee charged him with 69 rules violations. The committee was also considering whether to hire an outside lawyer for the <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> probe as it did in the former speaker's case. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, who handled the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case, said this week he has discussed with the panel the possibility of performing a similar role if an investigation of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> is approved. A complaint by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>. filed last April alleged that <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, the second-ranking House Republican, may have violated campaign finance laws and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules on outside income and receipt of gifts. The complaint focused on a partnership in which 21 investors put up $ 5,000 each to promote `` Window of Opportunity'' _ a book authored by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, his wife and a third writer. The ethics committee also received in June a request from <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans for an investigation of Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> `` Buz'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>. He is appealing his conviction on a charge of contributing to the unruliness and delinquency of a minor. After a <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, jury found <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> had sex with a 16-year-old girl in his <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> apartment, he was sentenced June 30 to 180 days in jail and a $ 1,000 fine for the misdemeanor conviction. He is free on bond and continues to perform his congressional duties. The committee _ officially the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> _ this week has a new member in Rep. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, replacing Rep. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, R-Colo., who resigned from the panel `` <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> is one of my friends,'' <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON> told reporters. `` The fact that he's a Republican leader adds a little bit of political heat to it. He gets no more or no less justice than any other member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> took responsibility for the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, saying crew error led to the tragedy that killed 14 people at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> last summer. `` The flight crew failed to set the aircraft's flaps and slats in the proper takeoff configuration as required by established <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> practices and procedures,'' the airline said in a statement from its <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> headquarters Wednesday. Flight 1141, carrying 108 people, rolled from side to side and got no more than 30 feet off the runway before crashing Aug. 31 on takeoff in a grassy field near the runway. The airline said Wednesday that the members of the flight crew `` are no longer flying with <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>.'' The crew members were fired Tuesday after being called to the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> chief pilot's office in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said Capt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the pilot, and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, the flight engineer, had no comment Wednesday on <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement, said women answering telephones at their Dallas-area homes. No phone listing was found for co-pilot <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said the airline's investigation was conducted separately from a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> probe of the crash He said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> expects the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> to release its conclusions in late summer or early fall. In <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> hearings in November, the three crew members admitted certain technical violations of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> regulations had occurred as they prepared for takeoff, but said they made all necessary pre-flight preparations. Attorneys for crash victims said they were glad <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> accepted blame for the crash but added that does n't mean their clients' legal action is finished. `` It will certainly expedite the cases,'' said <PERSON> Windle </PERSON> <PERSON> Turley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> lawyer representing at least eight passengers who were aboard <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141. `` If a case was going to take 18 months maybe now it will be done in a year.''

 <PERSON> Marie-Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fourcade </PERSON>, a French Resistance hero who was once smuggled out of the country in a mailbag to escape the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, died today in a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> military hospital, friends reported. She was 79. Mrs. <PERSON> Fourcade </PERSON> was admitted to the Val de Grace hospital on July 3. No cause of death was given. When <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> fell to the Germans in 1940, rs. <PERSON> Fourcade </PERSON> and a few friends organized a resistance group called Alliance, which eventually numbered about 3,000. Of that number, one-third were jailed or killed by the Germans. Mrs. <PERSON> Fourcade </PERSON>'s group relied on radio operators to collect and pass on information from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to British intelligence. The Germans caught her four times, but she was released or escaped each time. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Boutron </PERSON>, who smuggled her out of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> one time in a mail sack, once said: `` She was terribly feminine, but she has more willpower than most men.'' She slipped away to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in the summer of 1943 but returned in June 1944, the same month the Allies launched their invasion of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Each of her agents took the name of an animal, and she was known as Hedgehog. In 1968, she published a book about her experiences entitled `` Noah's Ark.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fourcade </PERSON>, who was born <PERSON> Marie-Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridou </PERSON> on Nov. 8, 1909 in <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>, spent many years in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where her father was a shipping agent.

<TEXT>
 Archaeologists trying to piece together a story of cannibalism by a gold prospecting party in 1874 have found the remains of four bodies in a mass grave. `` The working hypothesis today _ tomorrow I may change my mind _ is that we have a minimum of four individuals represented,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON>, physical anthropology curator at <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, said at the excavation site. He is one of a team examining the expedition, whose organizer and sole survivor, <PERSON> Alferd </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, admitted eating his five colleagues but said he killed only one of them, and in self-defense. Analysis of the bones for evidence of cannibalism will take some time in a laboratory after the excavation is completed. Found with the bones were quantities of burlap and a green suspender clip holding remnants of brown cloth, two hard rubber buttons and two badly corroded metal buttons, the scientists said. <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON> said scientists decided that four bodies were represented based on duplicate bones discovered and the arrangement of some bones that were uncovered, such as arm bones arranged adjacent to a shoulder bone. `` The cloth is most remarkable,'' archaeologist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON> said. `` It could help us put a date on things.'' <PERSON> Birkby </PERSON> said Wednesday's findings suggest the bodies of the men were wrapped in burlap and buried in a mass grave. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, who formed a gold-hunting party of five other men, said the group became stranded on a snow-packed mountain ridge two miles south of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He claimed <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a member of the party, killed the other four gold-seekers, and that he was forced to kill <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> in self-defense. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> also admitted to consuming the remains of the five men in order to survive. He was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to serve 40 years in prison. <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> organized the archaeologists' search for the truth about what occurred.

 Motorcyclists firing guns roared through this southern city and killed six people in an attack spurred by ethnic tensions, police said today. The violence occurred Wednesday night, and the city was under curfew today. Residents were told they would be shot if caught violating the curfew. Troops in jeeps with mounted machine guns were patrolling the streets warning people to remain inside, witnesses said. The shooting occurred in an area of the city dominated by immigrants who arrived from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> were partitioned in 1947, police said. They said 20 people were injured. The immigrants, who call themselves Mohajirs, want to be recognized as a fifth ethnic group in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Hyderbad is 95 miles north of the port city of <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, which also has been hit with ethnic violence. Most of the clashes have involved Mohajirs; Pathans, the ethnic majority in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> province; and <ORGANIZATION> Sind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalists </ORGANIZATION>, who want greater autonomy for the southern <LOCATION> Sind </LOCATION> province.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice ordered to retire because he turned 70 can remain on the bench under federal law prohibiting age discrimination, a federal judge said in a ruling released today. The Vermont Constitution requires all judges to retire at the end of the year in which they turn 70. But Justice <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, who turned 70 in December, refused to retire, saying federal law superseded the state constitutional provision. The state attorney general's office agreed with <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>. The state filed suit to force <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> off the bench. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagliardi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> can remain on the job. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said today he was extremely pleased by the decision, but added: `` That's the battle. It is not the war. `` It is very likely there will be an appeal,'' said <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>. `` I expect the state will appeal, and we will have to wait for that.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> lawyer who represented the state in the case, said he had just received the decision and was not prepared to comment. Previously Gray and lawyers for <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> had said an appeal to the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> was probable no matter which way <PERSON> Gagliardi </PERSON> decided. The lawyers have said the issue is not likely to be settled until the <ORGANIZATION> U.S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rules on the question. The 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which has no jurisdiction over <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, ruled against a justice in a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> case last year. The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which prohibits mandatory retirement provisions, contains exceptions: elected officers; the personal staff of elected officers and policymaking appointees. The 1st Circuit, ruling in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> case, found that judges are policymakers. But <PERSON> Gagliardi </PERSON> specifically disagreed with that ruling. `` A judge's principal activity is to decide cases between litigants,'' he said. <PERSON> Gagliardi </PERSON> is himself 70. He is one of roughly 300 federal judges on senior status. They are semi-retired, determine their own workload and handle about 15 percent of federal cases. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> is one of five justices on the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s highest court and only appeals court. He was appointed to the court in 1981, and has three more years in his term and would then have to seek legislative retention to continue on the court. He has said he might consider retiring before his term is up, but only if the age issue was settled.

 Thousands of high school students who support a teachers' union that has been banned by the government clashed with riot police in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> today, news reports said. Police fired tear gas to break up the protests by 5,000 students who tried to march from a university campus to nearby streets, shouting slogans for a teachers' union, the <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. About 600 students were briefly detained by police, it said. <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> reported there were some injuries, but police had no figures. The news agency said some students threw rocks at police. `` We love teachers! Do n't punish them!'' students shouted, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>. Thousands of activist teachers are pushing to organize a labor union in defiance of a government ban. The govenrment is threatening to punish all teachers affiliated with the union.

 A former Exxon computer operator who destroyed records on the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill has sued the company, accusing it of wrongfully firing and slandering him. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in state district court in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on behalf of <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, his attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The amount of damages sought by Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> was not specified <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> will give <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> officials a sworn statement explaining how the computerized records were erased only if a judge is present to protect his client from harassment by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> lawyers. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 33, has acknowledged that on June 5-7, he and three other employees recorded over computer files containing information on the March 24 grounding of the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit charges that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> fired <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to make him a scapegoat for the company's violation of court orders to perserve documents on the tanker's spill of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil. The lawsuit says the destroyed records were the only complete file <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had on the spill, and that there is no way to verify whether the oil company has other copies. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> attorneys, in a memorandum filed Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, say the erased files were backup copies that it was not required to preserve. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> says in the lawsuit that he erased the first tapes April 24 on the orders of supervisor <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrott </PERSON>, even after <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> indicated to <PERSON> Parrott </PERSON> that the tapes contained records from the day of the spill. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was fired June 9 for insubordination. He says in the lawsuit that he had received dozens of memos praising his work. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s memorandum describes <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> as a disgruntled worker who, after his firing, took unfounded allegations to a reporter. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Serdahely </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> said late Wednesday that he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities today freed 24 men described as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s last political prisoners, and hundreds of cheering supporters escorted them back to their hometown in this South African-ruled territory. Their group, the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, said it had unearthed 27 bodies in a mass grave. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> fought the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> in a 23-year bush war, and it is now favored in elections expected in November. Territorial authorities acknowledged burying 11 guerrillas but dismissed the report of 27 bodies. The released prisoners were placed in a bus that took them back to the <LOCATION> Katatura </LOCATION> black township on the edge of <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>. The bus was surrounded by a crowd of up to 300 cheering, jogging supporters as it crawled the two miles from <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> Central Prison to the township. Territorial administrator <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> announced Wednesday he would free the 24 men whom he called the last political prisoners in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. However, he said eight others held in connection with political violence would remain in prison. <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> previously linked the release of political prisoners to freedom for people he say <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> holds in Angolan, Zambian and Tanzanian camps. <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> said he changed his mind when <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> assured him the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> would seek the return to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> of all SWAPO detainees. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is in the territory for talks on a U.N.-monitored independence process that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> approved in December. The transition began in April. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has said it released all of its 201 detainees. But relatives and the freed detainees themselves said nearly 2,000 more detainees are in <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> camps. When the 24 prisoners held by authorities returned home today, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s information secretary, <PERSON> Hidipo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamutenya </PERSON>, announced on a loudspeaker that on Saturday the group had dug up 27 bodies from a mass grave where they were dumped last week by territorial police in <LOCATION> Ovamboland </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamutenya </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces were present during the unearthing. He gave no further details. Senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials could not be reached because they flew to the north early today with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to inspect security there. <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roux </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, questioned whether <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials were present at such an unearthing. He said they did not mention it when <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> on Wednesday. Inspector <PERSON> Kerrie </PERSON> du Rand of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said police had buried in the bush 11 bodies of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas on Friday. He said the guerrillas were killed during battles in April that nearly derailed the independence process. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON> said the bodies had been kept in a refrigerator at the <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION> morgue but had been unclaimed. He called the figure of 27 bodies `` blatant propaganda.''

 Chinese student <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, who headed a list of dissidents wanted by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities, has been arrested after more than a month in hiding, prominent Chinese exiles said today. <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, who with <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was among the best-known leaders of the democracy movement suppressed last month, told a news conference he had received confirmation of his colleague's arrest earlier in the day. `` <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> is one of the greatest fighters for freedom in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today,'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> told a news conference, his voice cracking with emotion. `` Recently the authorities have tried to dirty <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>'s image by calling him a traitor. The contribution of <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, this 20-year-old student, will live on in the history of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> today, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Jinhua </PERSON> refused to comment on persistent reports there that <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> is under arrest. Wu'er and four other Chinese dissidents issued an appeal to governments, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, human rights groups and individuals around the world to pressure the Chinese government `` to put an end to secret arrests, to torture, to secret executions.'' The five also proposed that a representative assembly be called to create a <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> to unite Chinese `` without distinction of parties, tendencies, groups, beliefs, professions or regions to unite under the banner of liberty, democracy, legalism and human rights.'' Wu'ur was joined by businessman <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Runnan </PERSON>, political scientist <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON>, journalist <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Binyan </PERSON> and economist <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaozhi </PERSON>, the former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marxist-Leninist </ORGANIZATION> studies in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said he does not believe the current government in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can last more than two years. `` I'm not saying that what will follow <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> will be a democratic government, but it will be replaced by a more moderate faction,'' he said. `` We can not predict when a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might emerge in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but it's a possibility,'' he said, referring to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhai </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Wu'er said there was no organization in place to help wanted leaders get out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Before June 4, we never would have imagined that the government would be so cruel and barbarous, so we never had such an organization,'' he said. He said he and others who escaped `` have the responsibility to continue the work of all those who have been arrested and executed and lost their lives.'' Since the June 3-4 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, at least 12 people who participated in the protests have been executed. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency has said nearly 100 soldiers and police died and that thousands were injured, while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured in the crackdown. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as 3,000.

<HEAD>State Report Clears Utility in Rocket Fuel Plant Explosion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A natural gas line beneath a rocket fuel plant destroyed in an explosion last year was under too much pressure but did n't cause the blast, state regulators have concluded. The state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigative report into the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> explosion in May 1988 also cited inadequate record-keeping and inspections by the gas supplier, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. But the three `` probable noncompliances identified during the course of the investigation were not responsible for the Pepcon fire and explosions,'' the commission's staff reported Wednesday. The explosion killed two people, injured 326 and caused $ 73 million in damage. <PERSON> Pepcon </PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> for $ 30 million, claiming the utility's pipeline was primarily responsible, and has since relocated its plant in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The report's finding runs counter to theories that a huge gas leak triggered the blast or that a small gas leak over a 2-week period before the explosion had saturated the ground and caused a fire that led to the explosion. A county fire department report has said the explosion was touched off by a welder's torch that ignited large quantities of ammonium perchlorate, a component used in solid rocket fuel. The state report, released on the condition that it not be used for any litigation, said commission engineers determined that <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> was generally operating within federal pipeline safety rules. However, at the time of the explosion <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 16-inch gas supply line buried beneath the <LOCATION> Pepcon </LOCATION> plant was under 308 to 310 pounds per square inch of pressure, slightly above the 300-pound maximum, the report states. The report said the pressure `` was not considered by staff to be detrimental to the serviceability of the pipeline.'' The report also says <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> was over the 15-month time limit for a pipe station inspection, but there was no evidence of a leak in the line. Southwest had n't opposed release of the commission report, saying it would vindicate the utility.

 <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> women said today they will end a demonstration that led to a clash with Turkish authorities because they achieved their goal of protesting Turkish control of northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The protest further inflamed sectarian passions between Moslems Turks and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Greeks </PERSON> and threatened to wreck 11 months of U.N.-sponsored talks on reuniting this Mediterranean island. `` We have achieved our purpose of emphasizing the Greek Cypriots' right to return'' to their homes in the Turkish-held north, said <PERSON> Athena </PERSON> <PERSON> Violari </PERSON>, one of the organizers Organizers said their protest would end later today. Many people now in the Greek-controlled sector fled the north when <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded in 1974. Despite stifling summer heat, thousands of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> women poured into narrow alleys of <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>'s old quarter today, responding to radio appeals to support about 1,000 woman protestors who clashed with police Wednesday. <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>, leader of the island's <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> sector, threatened to cut off talks on reunification because of the Greek Cyriot protest. He was speaking to a rally while the 120,000 Turkish Cypriots celebrated the 15th anniversary of the Turkish invasion that led to their breakaway state. <PERSON> Akis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fantis </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> government, appealed for calm and warned of `` painful consequences'' if the situation deteriorates. About 1,000 Greek Cypriot women and some male supporters pushed across <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>'s U.N.-policed buffer zone Wednesday night and clashed at its edge with Turkish Cypriot forces. The women penetrated the boundary, called the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, at dusk after scuffling with the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> soldiers who patrol it and knocking down barbed wire barricades at the <LOCATION> Ayios </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kassianos </LOCATION> neighborhood. They occupied a war-damaged elementary school and a church. A few minutes later, Turkish riot police supported by dozens of soldiers armed with rifles charged into the buffer zone. Four people were injured, Turkish authorities said. Organizers of the Greek Cypriot protest today demanded that <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> authorities free 100 women and 11 men, including Greek Orthodox Bishop <PERSON> Chrysostomos </PERSON> of Kitium, who were arrested when Turkish authorities moved in. Those arrested included <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>, a British reporter for <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency; <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> reporter who holds dual <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> and American nationality; and Dutch radio reporter <PERSON> Hetty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubberding </PERSON>. Turkish Cypriot Radio <PERSON> Bayrak </PERSON> said the arrested protesters were taken to courts in the Turkish sector of <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> today, but it gave no other details. The thousands of women who joined the protest today, responding to radio appeals for support, filled the narrow streets near the buffer zone. Many of the women, some wearing factory workclothes, left their jobs to join the protest. They were joined by scores of black-robed Greek Orthodox priests singing Byzantine hymns.

 Floodwaters washed at least 10 vehicles off a bridge into a creek that rose about 13 feet in 30 minutes early this morning, killing at least one person, authorities said. The high water hampered divers who were searching downstream this morning for another car that may have contained as many as three people, said <ORGANIZATION> Fauquier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION>'s Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Flohr </PERSON>. `` It's the age-old story: people forget about the tremendous force of running water,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, director of county emergency services. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said the cars were swept off the bridge on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 17 between <PERSON> Delaplane </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 50 in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> just after midnight. The bridge, normally 10 feet above <ORGANIZATION> Goose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION>, was under 2 to 3 feet of water at the height of the flooding, officers said. Two motorists were rescued by boat off the tops of their cars while others made their way to shore. After the water receded, rescuers found the body of a woman whose car had not been seen leaving the bridge, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. She was identified as <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Conneway </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bloommerry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said sheriff's Maj. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> `` We had no warning whatsoever.

It caught everyone by surprise,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Billet </PERSON>, a weather service forecaster in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the thunderstorm was a local one `` that popped up in the front range of the mountain.''

<HEAD>Scientists Brew Semiconductors From Yeast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists have discovered that a simple kind of yeast creates excellent specimens of a new kind of matter _ semiconducting crystals so small they behave somewhat like individual atoms or molecules. The yeast organisms produce the tiny crystals when exposed to cadmium, a highly toxic metal, in a process that apparently detoxifies the metal. Semiconducting crystals are the basis of chips that are used for all kinds of electronic devices. Studying the tiny yeast-generated crystals should help researchers understand how small transistors can be shrunk before they begin to take on the quantum properties of atoms and molecules, losing their normal semiconducting properties. A paper on the findings was published in the April 13 issue of the journal Nature by physicists at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and biochemists at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill., faces a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee investigation into allegations he sexually assaulted a Peace Corps volunteer while on an official trip to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` Obviously we believe people should be innocent until proven guilty,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Colo </LOCATION>., one of three Democrats who formally requested an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee The panel must inquire when such a request is made. But the `` behavior is fairly shocking if it proves to be true,'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said. `` There's just no excuse ... We can not let power go to people's heads.'' The Peace Corps worker claims Savage, while on an official trip, fondled her for more than two hours in the back of a chauffeur-driven embassy car in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, on March 19, according to several government officials. Savage denied the charge. `` I did nothing, that's what I did,'' the black congressman told television reporters outside the Capitol. `` This lie was leaked by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for political reasons.'' `` They tried to destroy Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> with a lie ... I'm in very good company,'' <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said In calling for an ethics investigation, <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> was joined by Democratic Reps. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We write to ask the ethics committee to inquire into the assertion that our colleague from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, Mr. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, behaved improperly towards a federal employee while on a congressional tour,'' said the letter sent to ethics committee chairman Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif. The letter noted that the lawmakers had no independent knowledge of the incident, but added: `` We believe that the accusation is sufficiently serious to justify your looking into it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has sent a separate confidential letter to the committee noting the allegations, said <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> of the agency's inspector general's office. Outside the committee room today, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> material was `` an assertion of what they believed to be the facts.'' The committee met privately for 90 minutes today, and <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said afterward he had no announcements to make on the Savage case or any other issues facing the panel. The incident allegedly occurred while <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> was on a visit to <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and had dinner one night at the residence of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrop </PERSON>. Those attending the dinner included the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> volunteer, who was scheduled to brief the congressman a few days later on agency activities there, said a <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. After dinner, <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> insisted the woman ride alone with him in an embassy limousine while the congressman, members of his staff and others visited area bars, the official said. `` He tried to force me to have sex with him ... He kept touching me, after I told him to stop, many times, loudly,'' she was quoted as saying in Wednesday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Savage offered reporters a different version. `` We were in a caravan of four or five cars,'' he said. `` We made four or five brief stops and got out of the car and got back in. If there were any kind of abuse, then why would she keep getting back into the same car?'' The woman left her post in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> for six weeks of counseling and medical treatment at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hospital and is awaiting another <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> assignment, the agency official said. But the 28-year-old worker, whose name has not been disclosed, had declined to file a formal complaint against <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, believing it would hurt the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, the official said. Savage, 63, has encountered criticism before for absenteeism in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and globe-trotting appearances for questionable causes, accused by government agencies of failing to disclose sources of funds and investigated for personnel practices. But he remains popular in his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> district, winning re-election last November with 83 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> was first elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> said that during his first year he participated in only 51 percent of the recorded votes. The following January, <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> showed up at a demonstration in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, leading 50,000 demonstrators against American policy who were described as mainly Communist trade unionists.

<HEAD>Court Official Played Dual Roles, Lawyer Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The nation's top immigration appeals official took part three ago in a secret committee that shaped plans to apprehend and deport alien terrorists, according to government documents. It was `` a clear conflict of interest'' for <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Milhollan </PERSON> to serve on a policy-making panel while he supervised the immigration courts, said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Hout </PERSON>, attorney for eight <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-area </LOCATION> immigrants fighting deportation. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Hout </PERSON> said <PERSON> Milhollan </PERSON>'s dual functions prejudiced a government case against the immigrants _ seven Palestinians and a Kenyan. In a legal brief, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers argued that <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Hout </PERSON>'s allegations `` have no relevance'' to his clients' case because the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, not <PERSON> Milhollan </PERSON>, filed the charges. <PERSON> Milhollan </PERSON> is director of the <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, which oversees the nation's two dozen immigration courts and all immigration appeals. The Alien <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on which <PERSON> Milhollan </PERSON> served sought to `` expeditiously remove terrorist aliens found within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' and deport `` alien activists who are not in conformity with their immigration status,'' according to the documents, obtained under the Freedom of Information act. Also on the panel were the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litigation </ORGANIZATION>, which is prosecuting <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>'s clients, and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` It's outrageous that a government official, supposed to be sitting in a judicial capacity, would be meeting with the prosecutorial arm of the agency whose cases he's reviewing,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Hout </PERSON> said. `` It's like a federal judge meeting with prosecutors in advance of trying a case,'' he said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Hout </PERSON> and other lawyers for the immigrants have petitioned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to summon <PERSON> Milhollan </PERSON> to testify about his role. The eight immigrants were arrested in January 1987 and jailed for almost two weeks on charges that they belonged to a Palestinian group with a history of terrorism, the Popular Front for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. In December, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> overturned several key provisions of the McCarran-Walter Act, which authorized the deportation of aliens who advocate communism, totalitarian dictatorship or the unlawful destruction of property.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer to pay $ 30 million to families of those killed when an Iranian jetliner was shot down by the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> demonstrated <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s low regard for Iranian lives, a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> newspaper said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> compensation offer was `` an attempt to counter an Iranian lawsuit against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it would pay up to $ 250,000 for each full-time wage earner and up to $ 100,000 for others killed when the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jetliner was shot down July 3 last year. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer followed the filing of claims in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> court on behalf of more than 200 heirs seeking a total of $ 145.5 million in compensation for their dead relatives. <PERSON> Kayhan </PERSON> said that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer of $ 100,000 for non-wage earners was not `` even a respectable illegal kickback in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> these days.'' `` Each life at $ 100,000 equals the price tag for four <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> speeches, three speeches by <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and two by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. That is cheap,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted the newspaper as saying. There were 250 Iranians and 40 citizens of other countries aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jet when it was shot down by the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. All 290 were killed. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military inquiry determined that radar operators aboard the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which had earlier clashed with Iranian gunboats, had mistaken the jetliner for an F-14 fighter on an attack course. <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s compensation offer was far lower than what <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families were paid by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for 37 crewmen killed in an Iraqi air attack on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate Stark in May 1987. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said the pilot mistook the Stark for an Iranian warship. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> paid about $ 740,000 to each of the slain men's families. The Stark settlement totaled about $ 27 million for 37 crewmen killed in the attack, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer amounted to $ 30 million for 290 lives, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Kayhan </PERSON> as saying.

The river emanates from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and serves as a frontier for <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Evros </LOCATION> province accused the Bulgarian battery factory of dumping chemical waste into the river, killing the fish. The factory lies near the Greek-Bulgarian border and was the focus of attention last summer, when the same problem occured. Tons of rotting fish on the river banks are creating a health hazard and farmers have stopped drawing water for irrigation. Environmentalists fear the polluted waters could create problems in the <LOCATION> Evros </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> delta, a breeding ground for tens of thousands of migratory birds.

 A 2-pound baby was hospitalized in critical condition one day after a doctor declared her dead, a spokeswoman said Thursday. The girl began to cry moments before an undertaker arrived to pickup her body Wednesday. `` The hair just stood up on the back of my neck. By the time the funeral home got there, we had her in the nursery and stabilized and on a respirator,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Brouillette </PERSON>, who had pronounced the infant dead. The baby was rushed to <ORGANIZATION> Schumpert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s neonatal intensive care unit in <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Katina </PERSON> <PERSON> Payton </PERSON>, 17, gave birth to the unnamed child around 5 a.m. Wednesday in <LOCATION> Natchitoches </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The baby was three months premature, Miss <PERSON> Payton </PERSON> said. But the baby had trouble breathing, <PERSON> Brouillette </PERSON> said. Doctors spent 20 minutes trying to resuscitate her. `` She had no noticeable heartbeat,'' <PERSON> Brouillette </PERSON> said. `` We put a tube in her trachea and breathed for her with a bag, but she just did n't respond.''

<TEXT>
 Soviet TV viewers finally got a chance Thursday to see what the rest of the world saw 20 years ago: the first steps by a man on the moon. State-run TV featured a lengthy documentary on the Apollo 11 lunar landing by astronauts <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Buzz </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON>, including interviews with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists. On July 20, 1969, Soviet television ignored the historic landing that millions around the world witnessed live, and instead broadcast a musical variety show. Thursday's 20th anniversary documentary showed footage from the moonwalk by <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON>, with the astronauts gathering samples of moon rocks. The American flag was clearly visible. The narrator of the documentary, former Soviet cosmonaut <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevastyanov </PERSON>, translated <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>'s famous first words on the moon into Russian: `` Eto malyenky shag cheloveka, i bolshoi skochok vsyevo chelovechestva'' _ `` That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.'' Thursday's broadcast _ shown on a weekday morning that hardly guaranteed a wide audience _ followed a July 10 article in <LOCATION> Ogonyok </LOCATION> magazine that said it was wrong to hide the moon landing from the Soviet people. The article also gave a detailed description of the lunar landing. Under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or greater openness, Soviet media have reported on many topics they once did not cover. Soviet TV carried extensive coverage of the linkup of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Apollo and Soviet Soyez capsules in 1975, but largely ignored the American program to land a man on the moon.

<TEXT>
 Railroad repairmen returned to work Thursday, ending an eight day strike that crippled transport service, officials said. About 2,000 repairmen reported for work and most others were expected to resume normal working schedules by late Thursday, a state railroad spokesman said. More than 200 train drivers, brakemen, conductors and station staff who stopped work in sympathy with the repairmen also returned to their posts, the spokesman said. The striking repairmen demanded a 20 percent wage increase retroactive to July 1987 after rejecting a 10.7 percent pay increase from the government. On Wednesday, transport minister <PERSON> Simbarashe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mumbengegwi </PERSON> met with strikers at the biggest <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railways </ORGANIZATION> workshops in the western city of <LOCATION> Bulawayo </LOCATION>, and he said the government was working out a new offer. He declined to elaborate. Junior repairmen earn about $ 250 a month, rising to $ 700 in higher grades. Strikers said their action halted three-fourths of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s rail traffic, including freight services to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> ports of neighboring <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>

 A former aide to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> testified in court today that the evangelist gave him the authority to take large cash advances and use ministry credit cards. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, are charged with evading $ 525,000 in federal income taxes while associated with <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. Under questioning by defense lawyer <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said that as a vice president of the ministry, he had direct authority from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to take large cash advances, sign <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> checks, use <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> credit cards and authorize bonuses for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> employees. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said he gained the authority when <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, lured him back to the ministry after a brief absence he attributed to exhaustion. The cash advances, <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said, were used primarily for trips by the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> on ministry business. He claimed that money used for personal expenses was reimbursed, but said, `` I always have been lax about documentation. It's never been a priority.'' <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>'s testimony came a day after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in refusing to answer questions by defense and prosecuting attorneys. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s 10-minute appearance in the federal courtroom was without the presence of the jury. `` When his trial comes about, there will be no taking of the Fifth Amendment and no refusal to answer any questions that the government cares to ask and to go into the entire matter in depth,'' said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and former top <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> are scheduled to go on trial for conspiracy and wire and mail fraud on Aug. 28. After <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> refused to answer questions, Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> released the witness, saying, `` This court will not force him to testify.'' <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> said he is barred from mentioning to the jury that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> ever appeared in court. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> took the stand Wednesday and described his association with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. Both Taggarts were fired when <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> took over at the television ministry following <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s resignation in March 1987 following revelations of the <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> sex-and-money scandal.

<HEAD>Bill to Restructure Federal Uranium Operations Wins Senate Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Over objections by consumer and environmental groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday approved legislation designed to revitalize the government's money-losing uranium enrichment operations, which make fuel used in nuclear reactors. The vote was 73-26. A similar bill in the House has not been voted out of committee. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure would convert the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s uranium enrichment operations to a government corporation, a move that some consumer and environmental groups claim would amount to a $ 9 billion bailout of the nuclear industry. `` This is just another attempt by the nuclear industry to raid the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Borson </PERSON>, an nuclear specialist for the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>. His group had lobbied <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members to defeat the measure. `` The bill would do nothing to prevent the uranium enrichment program from incurring more debt and eating up more taxpayer money in the future,'' <PERSON> Borson </PERSON> added. The legislation is sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., whose state is host to one of the two Energy Department enrichment facilities The other is in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The proposal has strong backing by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and the nuclear industry. The American Nuclear Energy Council, representing utilities and others in the nuclear business, called the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote `` a major step toward increasing the competitiveness'' of the enrichment enterprise that nuclear utilities are dependent upon. The government is the only domestic supplier of enriched uranium, which is the fuel used in nuclear reactors. The department's plants increase, or `` enrich,'' uranium-235 atoms beyond their natural concentration. `` Electricity consumers will benefit because competitively priced enrichment services will keep nuclear fuel costs low,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, president of the nuclear council. The proposed new corporation would be independent of the federal bureaucracy and could make financing and operating decisions without prior approval from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The administration says this conversion would make the enrichment operation more sound and capable of competing against foreign suppliers of enrichment services _ including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which now supplies some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear utilities. The plants also enrich uranium for use in government reactors that make materials for nuclear warheads. Environmentalists and some other citizen groups contend that since the utilities benefit from operation of plants built decades ago with taxpayers' money, the industry should be held responsible for the debt incurred by the plants. The Energy Department says the industry should not be held accountable because the plants' operation benefit the whole country. It also says there is $ 3 billion in outstanding debt, not the $ 9 billion claimed by Public Citizen.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> has received <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> files on lawyer-pilot <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON> and is looking into contradictions in his account of his 800-mile autopilot flight, a spokeswoman confirmed today.

He said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON> would stay in the hospital for another week for testing. `` We hope the medical tests will finally end this mystery and put this all to rest,'' he said, noting that the battery of tests might include psychological testing. `` Various pilots reported that as he was intercepted from the right his head would turn to the right and as he was intercepted from the left, his head would move to the left,'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigator, said Wednesday. He said the plane's sun visor was moved at least three times during the flight, too. Still, <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>, who interviewed the 36-year-old <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> communications attorney again Wednesday at <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, refused to second-guess the pilot. `` He was there. You were n't. I was n't,'' <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> would n't say whether Root could face charges for misleading <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said his agency also is continuing to investigate the case, adding: `` We anticipate that once all our facts are developed, we will again discuss the matter with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' Results of Root's blood test for carbon monoxide were negative, ruling out that explanation for his claimed loss of consciousness, authorities said Wednesday. Results of drug and alcohol tests are expected later this week. The pilot says he was on a routine business flight, passed out, and must have been shot when his handgun accidentally went off before he regained consciousness in Bahamian waters. Root, who remained in stable condition with a gunshot wound in his stomach, maintains the .32 - caliber <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> revolver he kept in the plane's glove compartment must have discharged during the But <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> officials said the gun's safety features make such accidental misfirings impossible. And police and doctors said medical evidence indicates Root must have been shot several hours before his small plane went down. Root's plane lies beneath several thousand feet of water off the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Eleuthera </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said a decision on whether the plane should be raised for evidence would probably be made in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Also Wednesday, <PERSON> Root </PERSON> was sued in federal court in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> company that accused him of breach of contract and unlawfully converting money to his own use. Root is accused by <ORGANIZATION> Sonrise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, of failing to perform work he had agreed to do in representing investors before the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. It also accused him of double billing Sonrise, resulting in overpayments of nearly $ 100,000. Since March 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Sonrise </ORGANIZATION> has paid Root $ 1.9 million as an advance against legal fees and expenses and to reimburse him for <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> filing and hearing fees, the suit said. On July 3, a separate suit in federal court in <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, accused Root of legal malpractice, breach of contract and fraud in handling a $ 75,000 transaction for Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazemore </PERSON> of <PERSON> Byron </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bazemore </PERSON>'s suit contends Root sent the money _ meant as an initial payment for two broadcast companies _ to <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, chairman of Sonrise, without permission

<HEAD>Computer Network Still Vulnerable to `Viruses,' Report Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A massive electronic network linking more than 60,000 computers remains vulnerable to potentially crippling attack by computer `` viruses,'' the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the White House science adviser should oversee efforts to help protect the network, Internet, from sabotage. In a report, the agency said lax security procedures on Internet contributed to the severity of problems that resulted when a software virus `` infected'' the system last November, crippling thousands of computers. Internet, the main computer network used by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research community, comprises more than 500 national, regional and local networks nationwide and overseas handling unclassified information. Two of the largest component networks are sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report was released at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s government information and financial management division, told the panel that since the virus attack last fall, security has been strengthened on many computers connected to Internet. However, `` we still feel that the lack of central control -LRB- over security -RRB- ... remains a problem,'' he testified. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass, chairman of the subcommittee, asked <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> whether Internet was still vulnerable to computer viruses and other types of software sabotage. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> official responded: `` Sure ... No open system can ever be completely secure.'' Computer viruses are generally small strings of computer codes that can infiltrate software programs and replicate themselves thousands of times, causing computer systems to `` crash.'' In some cases, they can surreptitiously alter or destroy computer data. Also testifying at the hearing was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>, appearing on behalf of <LOCATION> ADAPSO </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that `` virus attacks can be life-threatening. Recently a computer used in real-time control of a medical experiment was attacked. If the attack had not been detected, a patient might have been injured or worse.'' `` The risk of loss of life resulting from infections of airline traffic control or nuclear plant monitoring systems is easily imaginable,'' said <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Cullinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report noted that currently, `` there is no lead agency or organization responsible for Internet-wide management. Responsiblility for computer security rests largely with the host sites that own and operate the computers.'' To help ensure needed security improvements, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> recommended that the president's science adviser, through the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, `` coordinate the establishment of an interagency group ... to serve as the Internet security focal point.'' It said this group should: _ Provide Internet-wide security policy, direction and coordination _ Support continuing efforts to enhance Internet security _ Obtain the involvement of Internet users, software vendors, technical advisory groups, and federal agencies regarding security issues _ Become an integral part of the structure that emerges to manage a high-speed <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> planned for the 1990s

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today named a housewife with AIDS and a medical professor as his selections for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Three Cabinet officers also will serve on the 15-member panel created by law last November to advise the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS policy for the next two years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choices are: _ <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> with AIDS _ Dr <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a professor of medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, 30, contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion she received while experiencing difficulties in the birth of her second child in 1987, according to <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Merdian </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> with AIDS She was then living in rural <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and experienced difficulties getting adequate medical treatment, <PERSON> Merdian </PERSON> said. Neighbors' fears also prompted her family to move, and she has been living most recently in <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, he added. She was vacationing in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> will bring to the commission a much needed perspective on the crisis, that of a person living with HIV disease. ... `` said <PERSON> Merdian </PERSON>, who also has AIDS. `` People with HIV disease need to be involved on every level of the decision making process.'' Also serving ex officio on the commission will be Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the secretary of health and human services; <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and Veterans Affairs Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders previously have named five members each to the commission. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminsitration stirred controversy by naming several prominent conservatives to an earlier AIDS advisory panel. AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. The incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus, now called human immunodeficiency virus or HIV, discovered in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users, although a small percentage of cases are attributed to transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring. As of May 31, AIDS had been diagnosed in 97,193 Americans, of whom more than half, or 56,468, have died since June 1, 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appointees to the commission were: Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, D-Ga., a physician who sponsored the legislation that created the commission; <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahrens </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Ramsey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, board of commissioners who established an AIDS task force in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a Baptist minister and coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; Dr. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarlais </PERSON>, coordinator of AIDS research for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state division of substance abuse services; and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, attorney who has written and lectured on legal and ethical questions relating to AIDS <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appointees were: <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; Dr. <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>, dean of the school of public health at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor who is a recognized expert in AIDS legal issues; Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Konigsbert </PERSON>, director of the health division of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and Environment; and <PERSON> Eunice </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, director of community affairs at White Memorial Medical Center in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

 A weakening Tropical Storm <PERSON> Dalilia </PERSON> headed past <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, bringing heavy rain and high winds but no reports of major damage. Hurricane <PERSON> Dalilia </PERSON> weakened to a tropical storm early Wednesday, but the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> continued to warn people _ especially residents of the island of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> _ to brace for heavy rains and high winds. At 2 a.m. HST Thursday -LRB- 8 a.m. EDT today -RRB-, the storm was about 185 miles south of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, moving northwest at 13 mph and was predicted to slowly weaken, according to the weather service. The weather service said that was likely the closest it would come to the state. The storm was 210 miles south-southeast of <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>, the most populous island, and was expected to pass within 100 miles of it today. Its maximum sustained wind speed was 63 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that speed reaches 74 mph. Wind gusted to 80 mph. In <LOCATION> Naalehu </LOCATION>, the southernmost community in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, residents braced for the worst, but were optimistic they would not need the water, canned goods, batteries and candles they had hoarded. A tropical storm watch for <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the southernmost in the chain, was upgraded Wednesday to a tropical storm warning, meaning residents could expect winds up to 73 mph, heavy rains, flooding and higher than normal surf. A flash flood warning also was in effect. A flash flood watch _ less urgent than a warning _ was issued Wednesday night for <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kauai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Molokai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lanai </LOCATION> as the weather service reported heavy rain throughout the state. `` Because it seems to staying on a course that will bring it parallel to the islands, we think the main problem might be from the rain; hopefully the winds wo n't be too extreme, but we might get some flooding'' said <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosendal </PERSON>, a weather service forecaster. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beach parks were closed for the second day as surf surged to more than 15 feet on the southeast coast.

 A mysterious disease is taking a heavy toll on a herd of caribou calves that were to be let loose in the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> wilds. Twelve of 17 calves born this spring within a herd living in pens at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orono </LOCATION> have died, seven from a diarrhea-like illness biologists are not able to identify.

In addition, two adult caribou in the <LOCATION> Orono </LOCATION> pens died of brainworm parasite. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Caribou Project leader <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollough </PERSON> said biologists are taking precautions to protect the rest of the herd from the parasite, which is passed to susceptible animals through infected snails and slugs. The parasite infests much of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s deer herd. Of the 14 caribou already released in northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s Baxter state wilderness park this spring, nine remain alive. One died after being attacked by a coyote, another died of the brainworm parasite, and three others died of stress and reaction to a drug.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> called on civil rights leaders Thursday to join a silent march to protest what they described as `` illogical, irrational and unexplainable'' <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions. `` We can not stand by and let four men and one woman in black robes halt our long-delayed march to freedom, any more than we allowed people in white robes,'' to do so, said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. Hooks called on `` thought leaders'' of the minority community in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to gather in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Aug. 26 for a silent march to protest the recent court decisions. `` It is illogical, irrational and unexplainable,'' he said. In particular, <ORGANIZATION> Hooks </ORGANIZATION> cited recent decisions overturning a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, plan that set aside some city contracts for minority businesses, permitting a reverse discrimination lawsuit by white firefighters in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> and weakening protection for people seeking to prove racial discrimination in jobs and contracts. `` This present <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is more dangerous to the legitimate hopes and aspirations of black people in this nation than ... any <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> proclaiming ` segregation forever' or any <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> standing in the schoolhouse door saying ` they shall not pass,''' Hooks told a news conference. Hooks, a former <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, judge, said he still respects the institution of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but termed the recent rulings `` berserk'' and `` tragic.'' Hooks explained that a decision to hold a silent march recalled 1917, when several thousand blacks marched silently in the streets of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to protect recent race riots in <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Participants in the upcoming march will be asked to dress the same as they did then: men in black, women in white. The plan is not for a massive march and there is no desire to disrupt city life on Aug. 26, said Hooks. `` We are not trying to mobilize large numbers, we are trying to mobilize the leaders,'' said Hooks. `` Frankly, if we have 1,000 to 2,000 people I'll be happy, provided they represent the scope and depth of the people. He said that organization of the effort is just beginning that that while he is inviting `` all people of conscience'' to participate, he has not yet contacted other groups about joining the effort. Other organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate reaction to Hooks plan.

<TEXT>
 About 55,000 Iranian drug addicts will be prosecuted and sent to labor camps next week upon expiration of a six-month grace period for them to kick their habit, it was reported Thursday. The move was the second stage of an anti-narcotics crackdown launched in December to stamp out rampant drug addiction. Law enforcement agencies will round up the addicts who have failed to overcome their addiction to send them to the labor camps to kick the habit, the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in a report monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. More than 80 percent of the addicts in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have been identified, according to an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION>, which have taken over from police. Guards will be stationed in most cities and along major highways starting July 23 for a 10-day period to identify and arrest addicts, he noted. The anti-narcotics campaign has concentrated so far on arresting drug pushers and traffickers. Almost 800 alleged drug smugglers, including men, women and a few non-Iranians, have been hanged since December.

He remained in jail pending a court appearance later today in the murder case. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investigators flew to <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> gave police `` statements related to the murder of <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>,'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police Detective <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want to say he confessed, but he implicated himself, for sure,'' the detective said. The unemployed fast-food worker from <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> was an obsessive fan of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, said Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Savitt </PERSON>, who filed a complaint charging him with murder. The 21-year-old co-star of the old television sitcom `` My Sister Sam'' and the current film `` Scenes From the Class Struggle in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>'' was shot once in the chest Tuesday morning at the door of her apartment building. A female friend of <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON>'s living in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> called police headquarters early Wednesday to tell police of his obsession, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` He expressed a fixation with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>. He appeared to be very fond of her,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. According to the woman, <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> said he had a video collection of `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'' shows and an autographed publicity photo of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. About a year ago, <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> had sent a letter to the actress, but there is no indication she had ever seen it, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` I would n't call it a threatening letter. I would call it an affectionate letter, but a bit rambling,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` He also expressed to his friend that he was going to harm <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>,'' but it was unclear to investigators why he might want to, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` The guy's real passive with everybody. He's being passive and polite with everybody,'' <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallums </PERSON> said after the arrest. The gun in the killing apparently was discarded and has not been found. Police believe <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, where he lives with his parents, late Tuesday aboard a Greyhound bus. <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> apparently had visited <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> several times during the past year, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` There is an indication that there was an ongoing attempt to contact her,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> had called Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>'s agency several times. Apparently, <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> called his friend in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> shortly before he arrived at Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>'s home, telling her he was nearing her residence. Witnesses identified <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON> from a photograph. Police allege that the suspect loitered near Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>'s apartment for about four hours. Police found no indication that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> was being harassed. `` She did n't have an enemy in the world,'' said her agent, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. `` She was a very successful young actress, on the ascent, getting job after job. I ca n't believe this has happened.'' Miss <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> appeared on `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'' on CBS with <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawber </PERSON> from 1986 to 1988, playing <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, the younger sister of Miss <PERSON> Dawber </PERSON>'s character, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. The killing was chillingly reminiscent of other attacks by fans on celebrities, including the one suffered by `` Raging Bull'' actress <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Saldana </PERSON> in 1982 when a deluded fan stabbed her repeatedly with a hunting knife outside her home. Miss <PERSON> Saldana </PERSON> survived the attack, for which a drifter received a 12-year prison sentence. A prison psychiatrist has said the man was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Saldana </PERSON> said: `` I feel overwhelming sadness for <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> being a fellow actress and at this time for her family who must be devastated. `` This is a very sad day for me and others in the business.''

 A woman accused of using arsenic to kill her former husband and a boyfriend and trying to poison her current husband is under investigation in other deaths, investigators said. <PERSON> Blanche </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 56, proclaimed her innocence through her attorney Wednesday after making her first court appearance on the charges. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> personally, while traumatized and upset over being arrested and denied bond, is determined to rally and present her side of all this,'' her attorney, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> McEntire </PERSON>, said outside court. `` She maintains her innocence.'' Two sources close to the investigation, who asked that their names not be used, told the <ORGANIZATION> Winston-Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> that `` a good friend'' of Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s _ a woman _ may have died of arsenic poisoning. When asked about that information, <LOCATION> Alamance </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> refused to confirm details of any cases, saying only that investigators were being asked to review several deaths. `` People are calling us and giving us information,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> police have some -LRB- information -RRB- that they are checking out. Anything that we come up with will be entirely up to the chief medical examiner and the attorney as to where we go from here.'' One possible subject of the investigation is <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, a grocery store co-worker of Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> whose death was blamed on cancer, WGHP-TV reported. A judge has ordered the exumation of the body of her father, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiser </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, to determine whether his 1966 death was caused by arsenic poisoning. At the hearing Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Alamance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON> scheduled a probable cause hearing for Aug. 1. Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> is being held without bond on the murder charges. The charges: _ First-degree murder in the 1973 death of her first husband, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ First-degree murder in the 1986 death of <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, a former boyfriend, in a warrant issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Forsyth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> _ Assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill in the arsenic poisoning of her current husband, the Rev <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who is being treated at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Alamance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Says Police Acted Above Authority in Seizing News Tape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge ruled Thursday in favor of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, saying police can not confiscate news footage merely on the suspicion it might contain evidence of a violation of emergency regulations. Judge <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Levison </PERSON> order the Law and Order Ministry to pay court costs and return the original news tape that had been seized Feb. 9 from a free-lance cameraman working for CBS. Police had allowed CBS to make a copy of the tape, showing a lawyers' meeting in a church during the national hunger strike by people detained without charge under the three-year national state of emergency. <PERSON> Levison </PERSON>'s ruling reviewed the statements made by police Capt. G.L.S. <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Huyssteen </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> producer <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldblatt </PERSON> indicating the officer had given several reasons at different times for confiscating the film. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Huyssteen </PERSON> said he had noticed <PERSON> Azhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cachalia </PERSON>, a prominent anti-apartheid activist and attorney, talking to a journalist at the lawyers' meeting and suspected he might have violated emergency restrictions that prohibit him from addressing a public meeting or giving news interviews. <PERSON> Levison </PERSON> said <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Huyssteen </PERSON> `` realized that the tape could contain proof of the breach of the conditions and resolved that it would be necessary to have a video version of the proceedings in order to have evidence of <PERSON> Cachalia </PERSON>'s offense. He therefore instructed his policemen to send for the police video team. `` Later there was doubt as to whether the police camera was working properly so he resolved to seize the video film of one of the journalists present,'' the judge said. The policeman did n't know what <PERSON> Cachalia </PERSON> was talking to the journalist about and even if he had breached his restrictions, `` the discussion ... could not possibly lead to a danger to the public safety,'' <PERSON> Levison </PERSON> said. The emergency regulations require a policeman to form an opinion that an action endangers the public safety before it can be stopped or evidence seized, <PERSON> Levison </PERSON> said. `` All this decision really does is underline that, as wide as police powers are in terms of emergency regulations, they still do have to apply their minds and there are certain parameters,'' said <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, the attorney who filed the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> suit. `` They ca n't simply walk in and take a tape on the vague expectation that it might contain something.

<HEAD>Phoenix `Model City' For 1990 Census</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Officials already are making plans for the 1990 census, getting a six-month jump on most of the rest of the country, because the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> chose it as the `` model city.'' <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> will share the results of its extensive planning with cities throughout the country, said <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordvold </PERSON>, the city's liaison with the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> `` We have about 140 people serving on 11 subcommittees putting together plans to make sure everyone is counted,'' <PERSON> Nordvold </PERSON> said. That includes detailed plans to count homeless people. Although most cities wo n't start planning for the census until about November, the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> effort has been under way since March, <PERSON> Nordvold </PERSON> said. He said a `` cookbook'' of recommendations will be prepared to help other cities. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> chose <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> `` because of Mayor <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>'s enthusiasm for the project, the city's mixture of minorities and its growth rate over the last decade,'' according to a newsletter published by the bureau's regional office in <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. An accurate count is important to local governments because state and federal funds are distributed on the basis of population, <PERSON> Nordvold </PERSON> said `` That comes to about $ 175 per person in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` If you're not counted, we miss that much.'' In addition, <PERSON> Nordvold </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> possibly could gain two congressional seats `` if we do a good job and count everyone.'' <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumm </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Lakewood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> office, said special efforts would be made to count minorities and the homeless. Minorities were undercounted by an estimated 5 percent to 7 percent in 1980, but the 1987 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which granted amnesty to many aliens who had been in the country illegally, should make the count somewhat easier this time, <PERSON> Nordvold </PERSON> said. `` We're getting a lot more cooperation from Hispanic groups because there is n't the fear this year of someone wearing a badge and coming around saying he's representing the federal government,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Dumm </PERSON> said census takers would spend the night of March 20 counting homeless people, the first time that there has been an organized effort to count the homeless. From 6 p.m. to midnight, they will visit shelters, soup kitchens and other places frequented by homeless people, she said. From midnight to 4 a.m., they will count homeless people on the streets. And from 4 a.m. to 6 a.m., they will count people leaving buildings where homeless people are known to sleep, she said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> accused the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday of slander and gross interference in the latest round of recriminations prompted by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s crackdown on pro-democracy protests. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, prominent Chinese exiles appealed for more pressure from governments and individuals on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders to halt secret arrests and executions of dissidents. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers of `` pursuing power politics,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has grossly interfered in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs time and again, seriously hurting the feelings of the Chinese people,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted a ministry official as telling <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>. At issue were separate amendments approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> that provide sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already has halted military sales and high-level contacts, but the amendments would also stop <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds from supporting trade with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and suspend satellite exports and nuclear cooperation. The two houses have yet to reconcile the differences in their bills. In a separate protest, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> legislative committee said the amendments `` willfully distorted the facts'' about the army's June 3-4 attack in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on the student-led protesters for a freer society. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislators of having unspecified `` ulterior motives,'' and warned that efforts to pressure <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, `` like lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet ... will ultimately hurt the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> itself.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has strongly objected to all foreign criticism of the army attack and subsequent arrests and executions. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, viewed by many of the protesters as a model of democracy, has been most heavily attacked in a blitz of broadcast and newspaper commentaries. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has protested the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy giving refuge to dissidents <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has protested an attack by Chinese soldiers on foreign diplomats. U.S.-China relations have been strained before over trade, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, but never since ties were restored in 1979 have emotions on both sides run so high. `` There are some people, a small group of people, who think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a bad influence and want to see -LRB- the influence -RRB- limited,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat on condition of anonymity. But he said he did not expect the quarrel to lead to a break in ties. Ms. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, meanwhile, said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> soldiers were `` acting according to their orders and ... Performing their normal tasks'' in searching foreign diplomats' cars at checkpoints in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and sometimes sticking guns in their faces. Military checkpoints go up around <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after midnight, and several diplomats have reported soldiers searched their cars in apparent violation of diplomatic immunity. She also defended the government's seizure of foreign newspapers and magazines at stores and hotels in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last week. `` We do not refuse all foreign books and magazines and newspapers,'' she said, although she could not name any not banned. `` But we do not allow those foreign magazines and newspapers whose content interferes in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs ... to spread unchecked on Chinese soil. This is quite natural.'' In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, student leader <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON> and four other men who have fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> called on `` all people in the world blessed with a moral conscience to come to our aid and help us put an end immediately to these atrocious acts of repression.'' They said a confidential report in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> reported more than 120,000 arrests in the suppression of the democracy movement since early June, and more than 100 secret executions in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Wu'er said they had received confirmation earlier in the day that top student leader <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> had been captured after more than a month in hiding.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the arrests of opposition activists in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> `` cast serious doubts'' on the government's stated intention to hold free elections next year. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> called on the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> authorities to release all political prisoners and allow the opposition to campaign in preparation for the balloting. It confirmed reports from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> that authorities had placed <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s top opposition leader, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, under house arrest and detained at least 42 protesters Wednesday. Troops prevented access to the home of Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a vocal opponent of the government and the daughter of a celebrated independence leader. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> pledged to hold general elections by early next year, and Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> say authorities have been increasingly concerned by Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>'s growing popularity. Relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> have been strained since army commander <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power in a coup in September and killed hundreds of people to crush a nationwide campaign for democracy. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> responded by suspending some 12 million dollars in aid, meant mostly for development projects and to help fight narcotics growing and trafficking. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government is deeply disturbed by this series of actions taken against <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s largest political party, which cast serious doubts on the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government's repeated promises to hold free and fair elections by may of 1990,'' the statement said. It urged authorities to allow `` freedom of movement and expression and to release other political priosners. We also hope the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government will permit the political activity essential for the holding of democratic elections.''

 Meeting deficit reduction targets in fiscal 1991 without a tax increase or a cutback in Social Security benefits would require a 10 percent across-the-board cut in federal spending, the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The $ 74 billion to $ 88 billion in spending cuts needed to meet the fiscal 1991 defict tartget of $ 64 billion without raising taxes would likely force the economy into a recession unless the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> further loosens its reins on inflation substantially, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was told. `` The central bank would have to permit faster money growth and a substantial decline in interest rates to ... offset the direct depressing effect of actions taken to reduce the deficit,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reischauer </PERSON> told the panel. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that he is willing to push interest rates lower to avoid a recession, but warned it is `` a difficult balancing act.'' `` Some day, some event will end the extraordinary sting of economic advances that has prevailed since late 1982,'' he said. <PERSON> Reischauer </PERSON> put the chances of the economy slipping into a recession during the next nine months `` in the 15 percent to 40 percent range.'' `` Retail sales have been disappointing in recent months ... -LRB- but -RRB- the weakness is at least partly offset by continued growth in personal income,'' he said. `` The stock market, which has always fallen before in previous recessions, continues to rise. And the recent decline in interest rates is likely eventually to help housing and spending on durable goods.'' But, like the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> is forecasting a more modest 2.4 percent rate of economic growth this year, slowing to 2 percent in 1990. The administration has predicted the economy will grow by 2.7 percent this year and 2.6 percent next after adjustments for inflation. The congressional forecasters also think inflation, interest rates and unemployment for all of this year and 1990 will higher than what the administration has forecast, but only slightly. With the economy slowing, it also predicts that civilian unemployment will rise from its current 5.3 percent to average 5.5 percent in 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION>'s economic growth projections have consistently been less optimistic `` and more accurate'' that those of the administration `` Despite the soft landing projected by both <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> and the administration,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said, it will be impossible to meet 1991-93 deficit reductions targets of $ 64 billion, $ 28 billion and zero without a tax increase or cuts in `` non-means-tested entitlements'' such as Social Security. <PERSON> Reischauer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> has reduced its estimate for the deficit for the current fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30 from $ 159 billion forecast last February to $ 150 billion. `` Although the 1989 deficit is almost certain to exceed the Balanced Budget Act target of $ 136 billion, it may not exceed the target by much more than $ 10 billion allowed in the law,'' he said. Although the congressional auditors have not yet incorporated their economic projections into budget estimates, <PERSON> Reischauer </PERSON> said the deficit outlook for 1990 is unlikely to change substantially from <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION>'s forecast of $ 116.8 billion to $ 140.1 billion. The difference in those figues is whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> includes the immediate $ 50 billion cost of the savings and loan bailout in the deficit as Democrats want or finances it through 30-year private bonds as advocated by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s S & amp; L bailout plan would actually reduce the deficit by $ 3 billion next year because the money collected through the bonds would count as revenues to the government.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be the big losers if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seeks to bar <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contacts with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> linked to terrorist attacks on Americans. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said adoption of such a ban `` would interfere significantly with, if not destroy'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ability to promote peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. After six months of talks between <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, the discussions are at a `` promising diplomatic juncture,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote. `` This is not the time to take away from the executive a key tool of our diplomacy.'' <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> is the designated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contact with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in the talks, designed to encourage eventual discussions between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> strip. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> signaled that he would seek to kill the move, pressed by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, and offer instead compromise language that would give the administration greater flexibility to continue the current talks. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> insisted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> be required to certify that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not dealing with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials who were in any way connected with terrorist acts against Americans. The compromise, expected to be voted on later in the day, would prohibit the contacts only if the president knows and advises <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the officials `` directly participated'' in terrorism. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> language would `` significantly and possibly decisively'' undermine the <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> talks and the peace process. `` The big losers would be <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and ourselves. I am sure that you and your colleagues would not want to assume such a responsibility,'' he said. But <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and other senators held out for requiring the president to make a certification to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which the White House considered an infringement on its authority. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his two principal foreign policy advisers, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION>, had worked throughout the day on Wednesday to kill the amendment by <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., barring talks with any <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official ever linked to the death, injury or kidnapping of Americans <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, appearing on the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, said the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment would `` terminate the dialogue that's been established between <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We think it's important ... that we maintain this dialogue if we're going to make progress toward peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> added. Congressional sources said Sens. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, also were among the holdouts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who invited Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday for a report on his just-completed trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, used the occasion to lobby against the amendment. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the lawmakers that `` if you pass this amendment and shut down any negotiations with anybody that's ever even breathed on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> ... that's a step backward, not a step forward. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the lawmakers `` that at this point in the peace process, fragile as it may be, that these kinds of limitations would not be helpful.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opened talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in December after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> publicly renounced terrorism and accepted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> has met periodically with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials without evidence of headway toward settling the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> dispute. After it was disclosed he had held two unannounced meetings with <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, the security chief of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s principal deputy, supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> led by <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> developed their legislation to limit the contacts. <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON>, was the founder and leader of Black September, which carried out a massacre of Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> in 1972. He was also a suspect in the murder of <PERSON> Cleo </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> in 1973. The proposed compromise has the effect of barring talks with organizers, such as <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, or the actual perpetrators of terrorism, but not limiting talks with officials whose direct involvement was not clear. The lawmakers voiced praise for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s performance on his 10-day, four-nation trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and gave an early signal of strong support for his promise of $ 125 million to spur free enterprise in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.

 A bomb knocked a TV station off the air and a guard was shot to death after the station ignored warnings not to broadcast news about the anniversary of the Sandinista revolution in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, employees and police said Thursday. The attack on a tower of the privately owned Televisiete Channel-7 occurred Wednesday night at <ORGANIZATION> Cerro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alux </ORGANIZATION>, on a mountain 16 miles outside the capital. A Televisiete official who spoke on condition of anonymity said station employees had been threatened for several days and were warned Wednesday not to broadcast news about the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the revolution that brought the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to power in neighboring <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The station covered the Sandinista ceremonies and broadcast an interview with Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Wednesday. A news release by the fire department described the damage to the tower and adjacent broadcasting equipment as extensive. The Televisiete official said Channel-7 may be off the air for as much as a month.

 Investigators are going `` one body at a time'' as they review other deaths for possible ties to a woman accused of fatally poisoning two men and making a third man ill, the sheriff said Thursday. <PERSON> Blanche </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 56, was arrested Tuesday and charged with assault in the poisoning of her current husband and with murder in connection with the deaths of her first husband and a boyfriend. Also this week, a judge gave permission for police to exhume the body of Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s father, but no charges have been filed in that case. Through her lawyer, she has denied all charges. She remains jailed pending a bond hearing. `` We do n't know where it's going to go to,'' said <LOCATION> Alamance </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>. `` We can only take it one step at a time, one body at a time. It's a long process to exhume anyone, so we can only take so much at one time.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Winston-Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified sources as saying that a good friend of Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s, a woman, may have died of arsenic poisoning. Television station <ORGANIZATION> WGHP </ORGANIZATION> in High Point said one death that may be investigated is that of a co-worker who was believed to have died of cancer. But <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> declined to provide details of his investigation or what deaths are being looked into. `` We confirmed we do have some names that we're checking into and we will not release the names and we will not release whether it's male or female,'' he said `` People are calling us and giving us information,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> police have some -LRB- information -RRB- that they are checking out. Anything that we come up with will be entirely up to the chief medical examiner and the attorney as to where we go from here.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was charged in <LOCATION> Alamance </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill in the arsenic poisoning of her husband, the Rev. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. He fell ill on their honeymoon this spring and is still hospitalized. After doctors said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was suffering from arsenic poisoning, authorities decided to exhume the bodies of Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s first husband, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who died in 1973, and a boyfriend, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, who died in 1986. Tests on those bodied led to the murder charges. Also this week, a judge ordered the exumation of the body of her father, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiser </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, to determine whether his 1966 death was caused by arsenic poisoning. The body has not yet been exhumed.

 Investigators and rescue crews conducted an `` inch-by-inch'' sweep today of the cornfield where a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 crashed, cartwheeling in a ball of flame and splitting apart. At least 74 people were killed. The airline said 186 of the 293 people aboard survived after the plane, crippled by a loss of hydraulic power, crashed during an emergency landing. Earlier, the number of survivors had been put at 176. `` We feel pretty confident about that number,'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said at an afternoon briefing, but he added that the airline had not quite completed a list of passengers. The plane hit the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> runway Wednesday and cartwheeled in a ball of fire into the field. But many survivors walked away from the crash. Today, rescuers looked through the wreckage for victims. If there were 74 dead and 186 survivors, that would leave 33 people unaccounted-for. `` It's tragic what happened, but amazing and delightful that so many survived,'' <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Halterman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said today from the agency's makeshift command center in the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Convention Center. `` Even the investigators ca n't say why so many people survived,'' she added, `` and there has n't been time for speculation.'' `` The idea is to form teams and start pulling together the clues. It will be an inch-by-inch thing,'' Ms. <PERSON> Halterman </PERSON> said. `` The flight recorder will be going back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> sometime today and we'll start interviewing the crew and the survivors, eyewitnesses and everybody we can who has first-hand knowledge of the accident We're also collecting maintenance records on the plane. National Guardsmen began working at daybreak, collecting pieces of the wreckage which were strewn over an area the length of three football fields. Ambulances and refrigerated trailers for the storage of remains were parked along the runway where the plane hit before skidding into a field. `` We swept the area four times last night for survivors. If they were fatalities, they just covered them up and went on,'' said an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Woodbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> who asked not to be identified. `` Today, we've started removing bodies ... and everything else.'' A flight attendant who survived the crash by crawling out of an opening in the burning wreckage was quoted by her parents as saying `` the Lord opened up that hole'' to allow her to escape. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> reported that emergency officials believed most of the missing were in the fuselage and were fairly confident that anyone still in the wreckage was dead. The 15-year-old jumbo jet experienced `` complete hydraulic failure'' before the crash, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. Parts of the plane were found 50 miles away. Flight attendant <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, 35, phoned her parents in <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, to say she was all right. `` She said she was tumbling,'' said her father, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. `` The walls were coming in. She said a hole opened up and the sunlight came in and she climbed out the hole. She said she knew the Lord opened up that hole.'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said he did not know the extent of his daughter's injuries except that she was not burned. `` I thought I was going to die,'' said 8-year-old <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Radtke </PERSON> of Prairie View, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, who was carried out of the fractured fuselage by a passenger. The boy, shaking but unhurt, clutched a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> button and a pair of plastic pilot's wings as he spoke. Flight 232, from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, carried 11 crew members and 282 passengers, including three infants, said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagin </PERSON>. The plane has a capacity of 287 passengers. Most of the survivors were sitting in the middle of the plane, in rows 9 to 19, said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Greco </PERSON>, director of the emergency department and helicopter services for the <ORGANIZATION> Marian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where many of the injured were taken. `` There was nothing left of the rear half of the aircraft. First class was devastated,'' <PERSON> Greco </PERSON> said. Except for the midsection, `` the rest of the aircraft was in tiny little debris.'' The Seattle-based cockpit crew was being treated for injuries at a hospital, <PERSON> Nagin </PERSON> said. He identified the crew as Capt. <PERSON> A.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, a 33-year United veteran; <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>; and Second Officer D.J. <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON>. Hydraulic systems provide power steering that allows pilots to manipulate the wing and tail controls of the jumbo jet. Without it, aviation officials say the plane would be uncontrollable. The tail engine failed, and this may have caused a hydraulic failure, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Raynesford </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The plane's three independent hydraulic systems are routed to the tail section The crash left a swath of charred runway and strewed bits of people's lives over the wide expanse: two sets of golf clubs, a wallet photo of a brunette in her prom dress, a <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> tennis shoe, a purple hairdryer, one black high-heeled shoe and a collection of <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> photographs. Four people near <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION>, 55 miles east of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, discovered a piece of the plane, 6 to 7 feet high and 6 feet long, in a corn field. Four miles away, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jahde </PERSON> found three pieces of the plane scattered in their cornfield. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jahde </PERSON> said one piece was a 6-foot-long metal band, engraved ENG 2. The plane may have experienced problems earlier Wednesday. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinsmore </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said she took the same DC-10 from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> in the morning. The plane made the return trip later. She said the plane began to leave the terminal at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> shortly after 10 a.m., when `` everything sort of shut off.'' The plane taxied back to the terminal, where it sat about 15 minutes for repairs. However, <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Herwig </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said it is `` complete hearsay at this point'' that the plane had had problems earlier Wednesday. <PERSON> Herwig </PERSON> said nobody official has said there was a problem. `` We do n't even know if it was the same airplane,'' he said. United spokeswoman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said she could not confirm that the DC-10 had difficulty earlier in the day and read this statement: `` I've been advised that maintenance records are what is called ` material,' which means they are part of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> investigations. Because of that, the information is not being released.'' The plane was flying southwest as it approached the airport, and its wings rocked as it descended until the craft pitched violently to its right, causing the right wing to hit the ground and sending the plane into a cartwheel. The plane nose and fuselage ended upside down. Survivor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> said during the last 30 minutes of the flight the attendants drilled the passengers on emergency procedures and instructed them to put their heads between their knees. After the crash, passenger <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said people were `` sitting there upside down and it began to fill up with smoke.'' `` Then God opened a hole in the basement and I pushed a little girl out,'' he said. `` I grabbed another, kept pulling them out until they did n't come no more.'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said he thought he helped a half-dozen out. Then he ran. Several others walked away.

 Nearly half the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> astronauts who flew in space shared a day of memories Thursday with the president. It was one small ceremony for man, recalling one giant leap for mankind. `` It's hard to believe that 20 years have passed,'' said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of man's first landing on the moon. `` Three days and three nights they journeyed. It was a perilous, unprecedented, breathtaking voyage. And each of us remember the night.'' `` They'' were the men of Apollo 11, which set down on the Sea of Tranquillity on July 20, 1969: <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> `` Buzz'' <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. On that day, they were the only human beings away from their world; on Thursday, they bathed in the glow of reminiscence outside the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum only a few feet from the command module <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> which carried them to the moon and into the history books. Behind them at the ceremony were models of the 36-story rocket that lifted them from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and the spindly legged lander that took <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> to the airless moon. Eagle, the lander, still is on the moon, a souvenir of the brief visit that will remain for all eternity, along with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag they planted and the footprints they left. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, the first of 12 Americans who walked the moon, said the space effort in the 1960s had `` a nobility of purpose ... not to conquer enemies, but to conquer ignorance.'' Buzz <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON>, No. 2 on the moon and now a strong advocate of proceeding onward to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> said `` the time for seizing the initiative in space is upon us.'' And <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who orbited overhead as a lonely lifeguard while <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> pirouetted on the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, said `` we have rested on our Apollo laurels long enough; it's time to get moving again.'' The president had words for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: `` For those old enough to remember that historic night 20 years ago, step outside tonight with your children or your grandchildren. Lift your eyes skyward, and tell them of the flag _ the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag _ that still flies proudly in the ancient lunar soil ... `` Project Apollo. The first men on the moon. Some called it quixotic, impossible _ had never been done. But <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> dreamed it. And <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> did it.'' Among the 700 guests at the ceremony were 66 of the 126 Americans who have gone into space, including 21 of the 30 who flew on Apollo. They went for the most part unrecognized: <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>, second on the moon on Apollo 12; <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Haise </PERSON>, who were going there but did n't make it because of an explosion _ the third man on their Apollo 13 voyage, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swigert </PERSON> has died. There were also <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Cernan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, the last on the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> _ more than 16 years ago. In the crowd was <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Paine </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator then and more recently the architect of the plans for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future in space that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> enunciated Thursday. `` That was first rate,'' he said of the president's speech. `` A good beginning.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who made two Apollo flights, called it a great speech and said he was n't disturbed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not specific about time and costs for the program he envisioned. `` Nobody knows what it will cost,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who also has flown the space shuttle four times, `` if anybody tells you the cost today, do n't believe it.'' <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweickart </PERSON>, who was on Apollo 9 _ a moon flight rehearsal _ said `` Part of the problem of Apollo was it had a single, wonderful goal but nothing to sustain the momentum.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, twice a shuttle astronaut and now head of the space agency, saw <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech as `` dynamite ... a clear road map.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he is asking `` my right hand man'', Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> _ chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ to develop realistic timetables and milestones for future exploration and to report back. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who has been out making pro-space speeches, said that `` when Americans set their minds to acomplish something, we always exceed our expectations.'' He addressed the crowd as `` My fellow astronauts.''

 As President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans Thursday for a manned outpost on the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and sending astronauts to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is trying to come to grips with financial and political problems in its space program. The Soviets, like the Americans, have considered a manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> and have laid the groundwork with long-duration space station missions designed to test whether cosmonauts could withstand a long journey to the planet. But as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> marked the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is trying to decide whether it can afford expensive missions that once were routine. Those included the launches of the first satellite, Sputnik in 1957, and the first man in space, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagarin </PERSON> in 1961. Once touted as proof of the superiority of socialism, a source of national pride and a sacred cow, the Soviet space program has now been criticized under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness. With chronic shortages of everything from toothpaste to housing, Soviets are wondering whether the $ 2.38 billion spent on the manned space program since 1986 is worthwhile. Already, Soviet legislators looking for ways to cut a $ 162 billion budget deficit have suggested slashing space spending. In part for economic reasons, the orbital platform Mir _ the showcase of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> space program designed as the first building block of a permanently manned space station _ has been without a crew since April. Cosmonauts are not scheduled to re-enter the station until late August. Adding fuel to the controversy were the November launch of the space shuttle Buran, whose development cost $ 10 billion; the loss in September and March of two unmanned Mars probes, Phobos I and II, at a cost of a half-billion dollars; and embarrassing delays caused by technical problems and human error in the landings of two crews from Mir last year. Opposition also grew when Soviet space officials hungry for foreign currency chose a Japanese TV reporter, and not a Soviet who could only pay rubles, for the first commercial trip to Mir. After 15 free flights with international crews, the Soviets are starting to charge foreign crews that want to travel to Mir, at a cost of $ 10 million to $ 12 million a shot. The Soviet space agency <PERSON> Glavkomos </PERSON> also is seeking foreign customers for satellite launching and hopes to sell crystals grown in Mir's zero-gravity for use in electronics. It also hopes to sell medicines manufactured on the space station. The Japanese mission and a flight by an Austrian cosmonaut are scheduled for 1990 or 1991. In an entirely privately financed trip, the first Briton in space is to accompany two cosmonats to Mir in 1991. As for the Buran, officials have not announced when it will fly again. State TV's nightly news program `` Vremya'' marked the Apollo 11 anniversary with a report repeating the traditional Soviet charge that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is militarizing space. Correspondent <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolyagin </PERSON> reported from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had considered setting up a base on the moon before but that `` gradually other space programs, plans for ` Star Wars,' pushed out the peaceful beginnings.'' The report featured interviews with the three Apollo 11 astronauts but did not mention <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech, which drew only a brief mention by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Earlier in the day, Soviet TV broadcast a lenghty documentary on the Apollo 11 mission, showing its viewers for the first time some of the footage from the historic July 20, 1969, moon landing.

 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s military government put the main opposition leader under house arrest Thursday and soldiers sealed off her home in a <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> suburb, according to diplomatic reports from the Burmese capital. Hundreds of students had defied martial law with anti-government protests Wednesday even though the opposition leader, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, canceled a planned rally to avoid clashes with the large number of soldiers in the streets. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s official radio reported 44 arrests. A source in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, citing a report from a Western embassy in the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> capital, said Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>'s `` compound was surrounded by troops'' and `` she tried to surrender herself to the military, but they refused and they forced her back inside.'' The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a diplomat and Tin Oo, co-leader of Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, were turned away when they tried to see her. No other details were available. Telephone and telex lines to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> cities were out of order Thursday. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, 44, was under house arrest and that soldiers were blocking access to her home. It said the arrest of opposition activists `` cast serious doubts'' on the government's stated intention of holding free elections next year. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio did not mention Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> on Thursday, but said diplomats were being summoned to a meeting Friday with the government's <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It announced an amnesty for people tried on or before Sept. 18, 1988. Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, the army commander, seized power on that day and his soldiers killed hundreds of people demonstrating peacefully for democracy. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> signed the amnesty order, which commutes death sentences to life imprisonment, reduces life terms to 10 years and cuts other sentences by one-third. Prisoners with two years or less to serve will be released and criminal cases still being heard will be closed, with the exceptions of those involving high treason or violation of martial law, the order said. The <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> source said the reason for Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>'s arrest was not clear, but the government may have used violence during Wednesday's Martyrs Day ceremonies as a pretext to move against her. He said her arrest also might be linked to those of three members of her party accused of bombing a government oil refinery earlier this month. Three people were killed. Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, whose father was an independence leader, is the military government's most vocal critic. Western diplomats say the authorities have been concerned about the growing popularity that attracts thousands of people to her rallies. `` <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> has been looking for a confrontation,'' the source in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said. `` Now it's happened.'' Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> had planned to lead thousands in a march Wednesday, the anniversary of the day her father, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, and other <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> independence leaders were assassinated in 1947. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> became independent of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in January 1948. On Wednesday, Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> said she canceled the march because soldiers `` blocked off all the roads and prepared literally a killing field for the people.'' In a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, she also said soldiers had beaten some of about 3,000 students in the capital's <LOCATION> Swegondine </LOCATION> district. A Western diplomat, also reached by telephone, said he saw soldiers pursue students down a side street, drag some out and hit them with clubs, then put 15 or 20 into a truck.

 Republican congressman today sprayed with water an effigy of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag-burner, and veterans groups urged lawmakers to undo the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that allows flag burning. Rep. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>, R-Pa., led more than a dozen <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, armed with fire extinguishers and a bucket of water, to the steps of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, where television cameras were gathered to record a rumored flag-burning by <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> `` You're not going to come to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and burn the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> flag,'' warned Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Miss. The flag burning never occurred, so the lawmakers sprayed and doused with water a stuffed dummy they called <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> that was held aloft by some anti-flag-burning protesters. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, whose 1984 flag-burning conviction was thrown out by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last month, held a news conference across the street and said he never intended to burn a flag today. `` I'm not going to, like fall into this silly trap,'' he said. Earlier today, veterans groups testified in support of congressional action to restore penalties for desecrating the flag. Two of the groups said a constitutional amendment was the only course of action, but one said it could also support regular legislation if that would work. `` Choose whatever course of action is best for our nation and our flag and you will have the support of the Disabled American Veterans,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> DAV </ORGANIZATION>'s national legislative director. <PERSON> Heilman </PERSON>'s openness to a regular statute to address the court ruling was at odds with representatives of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> that nothing less than amendment to the Constitution would be satisfactory. `` We must rally round our flag and pursue a constitutional amendment prohibiting the physical desecration of that flag,'' said H.F. `` Sparky'' <PERSON> Gierke </PERSON>, the Legion's national commander. A poll commissioned by the Legion found 75 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> believe such an amendment would not impinge on their constitutional rights, he said. `` Freedom of expression can and should co-exist with a sense of reverence for the flag and all that it means to Americans,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Magill </PERSON>, national legislative director of the VFW, told the civil and constitutional rights subcommittee. After four days of hearings, including two days of testimony from legal scholars, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel remained divided over how to overcome a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision on flag burning. The liberal Democrats on the panel remain adamantly opposed to a constitutional amendment and the Republicans vow to push it through. `` The idea of a constitutional amendment has been damaged severely in these hearings so far,'' subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Wednesday He and other Democrats said they were convinced by the experts to seek a regular statute over any amendment. But senior committee Republican <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> said, `` How can we enact a statute to ban such flag burnings ... which does not relate to the suppression of free expression? It's a puzzle to me how you can get around that.'' An unexpected argument against the political tide to reverse the high court ruling came Wednesday from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON>, who as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s solicitor general was the administration's chief advocate before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. When the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag-burning case came up before the court, Fried declined to advance an administration position _ a decision some say may have made the difference in the court's 5-4 ruling. Fried had been expected to tell the subcommittee that he did n't file then because he thought the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law and the federal code were defective and could be fixed But Fried agreed with other witnesses, including rejected <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, that the arguments against a statute were `` devastating.'' At the same time, he called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do nothing _ enact no statute, no constitutional amendment. `` Whatever the technicalities, the evident purpose of such a statute would still be to punish acts of expression,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, its traditions and values and its flag are important. But foremost among those values is the principle that no one shall be punished for his political expressions _ no matter how offensive or bizarre,'' he said, recalling his own childhood flight from oppression in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` I hope and urge and pray that we will not act, that no statute be passed and of course that the Constitution not be amended,'' he said. Democrats told him that was no longer a viable political position _ the choice was only between a statute and an amendment. But Fried told the lawmakers, `` There are times when you can earn your rather inadequate salaries by just doing the right thing ... It's called leadership.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> told reporters he still planned to send to the full House before the August recess a proposed statute, crafted based on the expert testimony. <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> to send both the statute and a constitutional amendment to the floor _ an approach already adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders. `` It is the right thing to do,'' he said.

 The <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Klamath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> topped a list of the 10 most endangered rivers released by a national conservation group Thursday. Other rivers included the American in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Penobscot </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Payette </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> James </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bighorn </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bayou </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Animas </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. `` These rivers are national treasures, because of their free flowing nature, ecological qualities and recreational values,'' said <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rivers </ORGANIZATION>. `` Yet, these outstanding rivers _ and, often, their scenic landscapes _ face imminent, major threats from uneeded dams, water projects or adverse land development.'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said his group released its annual list to `` call attention to the fact that they are in danger but are not dead, yet.'' The rivers were selected based on their national or regional significance and the `` degree and imminence'' of the threats they face. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said that six of the rivers on the list were threatened by hydroelectric projects and the others threatened by flood control and water supply projects and nearby land development. The group said the <ORGANIZATION> Platte </ORGANIZATION> faces two major problems, the Two Forks water storage dam proposed on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and the operation of upstream dams along a 200-mile stretch known as `` Big Bend'' in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. The $ 500 million Salt Caves Dam project threatens a 19-mile stretch of the upper Klamath in southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the group said.

<HEAD>Bush Says U.S. Must Go Back to Moon, on to Mars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twenty years after man's first step on the moon, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday Americans must commit to the permanent settlement of space, first returning to the moon and then embarking on a `` journey into tomorrow,'' a manned mission to distant <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. The president offered no firm timetable or pricetag for a program that could cost hundreds of billions of dollars but said it would be worth the cost `` because it is humanity's destiny to strive, to seek, to find. And because it is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s destiny to lead.'' His proposal was made in a ceremony, on the steps of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum, marking the historic moment July 20, 1969, when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> astronauts <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Buzz </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> stepped on the moon's Sea of Tranquility to fulfill a pledge made eight years earlier by President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The two moonwalkers stood with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Friday, along with <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, the third Apollo 11 crewman who said, `` We have rested on our Apollo laurels long enough; it's time to get moving again.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal _ to establish a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> moon base early in the next century and then mount a manned Mars mission _ likely will ignite a long national debate both in a budget-minded <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and among those who believe federal dollars should not be spent on costly space endeavors but on solving more earthly problems. At a time of huge budget deficits, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> already is balking at the start-up costs for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 30 billion space station, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said was `` a first and necessary step for sustained manned exploration.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he said, is `` where the future of the space station _ and our future as a space-faring nation _ will be decided.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered few details beyond his broad goals and said he was leaving it to Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, as head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to come up with `` realistic timetables.'' Putting the space station in orbit has been scheduled for after 1995. The president chose to look beyond the budget debate over the space station budget. `` We must commit ourselves anew to ... the permanent settlement of space,'' he said. `` We must commit ourselves to a future where Americans and citizens of all nations will live and work in space.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator hailed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initiative as `` dynamite'' and said that if the program is approved, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will be ready to establish a moon base `` in the dawn of the new century.'' Truly said cuts in the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> budget in recent years have weakened the agency so that in its present structure it could not carry out such visionary plans. Truly said he had no estimate on how much <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s program would cost. But he noted that during the heyday of the Apollo program <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s funding represented more than 4 percent of the national budget compared with about 1 percent now. He said the job could be done with less than 4 percent. Other observers have estimated that if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal were adopted, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s present budget request of $ 13.3 billion would have to more than double within a few years and that the whole package eventually could cost as much as $ 800 billion to $ 900 billion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will need to forge an alliance with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders to win the funding for serious space exploration, and initial skeptical reaction came from Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader `` The real test of presidential leadership is not whether he can marshal the words but the resources to restore <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s preeminence in space,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` In sum, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, there's no such thing as a free launch.'' The proposal also drew opposition from a key member of the house committee that oversees <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> appropriations. `` Given the federal budget deficit and earthly demands, I do n't see how we can afford expensive manned programs in space in the near future,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` calling for one great leap for mankind'' but not even providing the money for `` one small step,'' using a take-off of <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION>'s first words from the lunar surface. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee charged with the space agency budget, said: `` By proposing a return to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and a manned base on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, with no money, no timetable and no plan, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offers the country not a challenge to inspire us, but a daydream to briefly entertain us. Meanwhile, the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> handily defeated an attempt by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, to transfer $ 714 million from the proposed fiscal 1990 budget for the space station to programs for veterans' medical care, pollution control and low-income and elderly housing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ceremony with the astronauts blended his glimpse into the future with reminiscences of the Apollo program. He unveiled a new postage stamp commemorating the first moon landing, then signed a proclamation marking Space Exploration Day. He invited the astronauts and their families back to the White House for a picnic lunch. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalled the first moon landing two decades ago, saying, `` Some called it quixotic, impossible ... but <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> did it.'' Now, he said, it is time for the nation to head `` back to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, back to the future, and this time back to stay.'' Under <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> scenarios outlined last year, a permanently manned base on the front side of the moon would require astronaut crews to construct an Antarctic-type facility, mixing mineral-rich lunar soil with water to form a kind of cement. Oxygen extracted from moon rocks could be mixed with hydrogen brought from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> to fuel expeditions to Mars and elsewhere. To explore Mars, one <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> option would use humans, the other a robot to move around the surface. A third would place men on the <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> moon Phobos to guide the rover on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>.

 A Chippewa Indian and the city are fighting a bowling organization which does n't allow men to bowl in tournaments if they wear their hair long _ but does n't have such rules for women. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Big </PERSON> <PERSON> Bear </PERSON>, who braids his 6-inch ponytail to complement his ceremonial dance costumes, was banned from a November tourney sponsored by the Amateur Bowlers Tour at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>'s Midway Pro Bowl. Big Bear and the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contend the rule discriminated against him on the basis of sex. A city attorney will urge that Big Bear be awarded $ 3,325 in damages at a hearing scheduled for Monday. `` We are saying, ` Why are they enforcing it only for male members?''' said <PERSON> Dulce </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, supervisor of investigations for the city's <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` If it is for safety reasons, it should be for both sexes.'' Amateur Bowlers Tour has resisted efforts to settle the case, prompting the city to set the hearing before a three-member panel of its <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, director of the Twin Cities division of the <ORGANIZATION> Amateur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowlers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tour </ORGANIZATION>, said the rule was established to provide a professional appearance for participants, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The rule states: `` Hair must be trimmed and combed and will not be permitted below the bottom of the normal collar for male members. Braids and pony tails, hair curlers and head bands are not permitted for male members.'' Big Bear, 35, who grew up on the White Earth Indian Reservation in northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, is a program manager for <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s chemical health division Big Bear said he has competed in about 300 tournaments, including an American Bowling Congress event in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, he said. Last fall and winter, Big Bear bowled in five leagues in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, posting a 178 average in one, and decided to enter the Nov. 26-27 event sponsored by the Amateur Bowlers Tour. The group started its Twin Cities division in September and guarantees a top prize of $ 1,000 in each of its weekly tournaments. Big Bear said he was about to pay the group's $ 25 membership fee when he learned of the prohibition on long hair.

<HEAD>Georgia Tech Microfilm Disappearance Part of Nationwide Theft</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One hundred reels of microfilm copies of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patents have disappeared from the library at <ORGANIZATION> Georgie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, and library officials say it appears to be part of a nationwide theft. A library worker noticed about three weeks ago that sections of the microfilm seemed to be missing, <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, dean and director of libraries at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. An inventory indicated 100 cartridges were gone. `` We discovered it, and then we heard very quickly that the same thing had happened at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>. The patent office notified us immediately that this was going on,'' Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said. In addition, 10 other universities that are depositories for copies of patent records have reported thefts, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said that because it appears different blocks of the patent records from the past 20 years were taken from each university `` it appears they are amassing a 20-year run of patents.'' `` They did n't take everything in one year,'' Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said. `` The dates they took from us were from 1971 to 1974 and 1977 to 1978. But in the 1971 period, they took 42 cartridges and only 10 of 1978.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trademark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, based in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday, `` The matter is under investigation.'' The loss of the microfilms will not have any impact on the patents themselves because the <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> maintains permanent records, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> estimated the replacement cost of the reels at $ 10,000, but she said `` the real issue is why anybody would want to steal these.'' `` We're not talking about secrets or anything like that. Somebody can come here or go to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Patent Office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> and use them.'' The <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> -RRB- News Leader reported Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was investigating the thefts. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said he was unaware of an investigation into the thefts. Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said no suspicious incidents regarding the microfilm had been reported before the discovery of the theft. She said the microfilm is stored in open library stacks, but there always is an employee in that area when the library is open. She said the library soon will `` close'' the patent records, meaning permission will be required to use them. She said other schools that have reported thefts of microfilmed patents are <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M, and the universities of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON> does n't how he'll react when he sees <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutz </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the first time in more than 44 years. But he knows the reunion Tuesday with the man he knew as a skinny teen-ager he helped save from a Nazi concentration camp will be a happy one. `` I never expected to see him again, and when I do, I probably wo n't be able to say a word,'' <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON> said. `` It all just does n't seem real.'' <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON> was an 18-year-old American infantryman serving in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> when he met <PERSON> Kutz </PERSON>, 17, doing slave labor at a Nazi work camp at the end of World War II in March 1945. <PERSON> Kutz </PERSON> is scheduled to fly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> home to <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, for the reunion with <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON>, 63, a retired electrician in <LOCATION> Rutland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Riska </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. In August, <PERSON> Kutz </PERSON> is to meet two other men from the old 4th Infantry Division, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nystrom </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mealy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The five will have plenty to talk about because it's likely none of them them would have lived to see the end of the war if they had never met. The young prisoner returned the favor of his freedom by warning the Americans of a German ambush. The Americans were ready and `` fought right through them,'' <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON> remembers. The reunion was arranged by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, vice president of the national Veterans for Peace organization and a member of its Dover chapter. On a January 1988 trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he was met at the airport by <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON>, who read about his visit in a newspaper. The young <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> retold his father's story of being saved by men of the 4th Division, and provided a few names and hometowns written on a scrap of paper his father had saved since the war. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> and members of his organization managed to track down the four old soldiers, who got choked up remembering `` <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> became `` Willie'' to the Americans, `` because we could n't pronounce his first name and did n't have time to learn,'' <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON> has vivid memories of his Soviet friend. `` He was a kind of small, rawboned kid,'' he said. `` They did n't feed him very well. After the ambush, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> tagged along and was adopted by the division. `` We dressed him and fed him and put him to work as a machine-gunner for two months,'' <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON> recalled. Though he spoke no English and no Americans spoke his native Ukrainian, the men were able to communicate in sign language, <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON> said. When it was time for him to go home, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> went in style, <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON> said. `` Some men commandeered a German staff car and we taught Willie how to drive it,'' he said. `` We gave him the car and sent him on his way toward <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said this is <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>'s first visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that it will coincide with a reunion of 4th Division veterans in <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> in August.

 Territorial officials Thursday freed 24 guerrillas described as the last political prisoners in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general said the plan for the territory's independence is on schedule The freed guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> sang a tribal ballad as they emerged from the prison in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> and were escorted home by nearly 200 supporters, who cheered and jogged with them nearly two miles in a freezing wind Eight jailed <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> members, including some responsible for bombings that killed more than 30 people, have not been designated political prisoners and remain jailed. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, visited northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s Ongwediva refugee camp, home to hundreds of people who have been repatriated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. About 1,200 people live in tents in the dry, dusty camp. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> also visited a voter registration station and met with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials and human rights workers. More than 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military and civilian personnel are in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to monitor a yearlong transition to independence after 74 years of South African rule. Several thousand people, many dressed in the red, green and blue colors of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, circled <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> when he arrived at the camp, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> flag fluttering on the hood of his <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>. Some held placards claiming harassment by Namibian policemen who served on a disbanded paramilitary unit known as <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> indicated he was pleased with the progress of the independence plan, which took effect April 1 and includes elections in November. But when asked if he was satisfied with the security situation in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, he said, `` No, I'm not ... We have to fight against intimidation and partiality.'' After 23 years of war between <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> authorities, local residents are deeply suspicious of <LOCATION> Namibian </LOCATION> police, who remain responsible for law enforcement during the transition to independence. Most people in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> support SWAPO. No fighting has been reported in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since April, but territorial officials claim 1,900 <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas are in southernmost <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, near the Namibian border, in violation of a regional peace accord. Police in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> said Thursday that officers uncovered an arms cache that included a Soviet-made ground-to-air missile, grenades, and assault rifles. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> denies its fighters are near the border but has not said why thousands of guerrillas remain in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> when they are allowed to return to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> as civilians. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> also has said it released all 201 detainees that it held. But relatives, and the freed detainees, have said there were nearly 2,000 prisoners in <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> camps. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the assistant secretary of state for African, <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, suggested Thursday that former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> might go privately to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to observe the November election. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> observed the election last May in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

 Saboteurs in a ethnically torn areas of <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> damaged a dam that provides more than half of Soviet <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s electricity, a newspaper reported Thursday Armed bands of Abkhazians and Georgians kept shooting at each other for a sixth day in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> resort region, Soviet media said. Violence spread to <PERSON> Poti </PERSON> in western <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, where men seeking firearms attacked a factory and a gun shop. `` The situation is very, very serious,'' said <PERSON> Gizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Grzeledze </PERSON> of the Georgian Foreign Ministry. State-run TV showed tourists eating ice cream at an outdoor cafe in <LOCATION> Sukhumi </LOCATION>, 870 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and said clashes had subsided. About 4,500 Interior Ministry troops were in the region, and a state of emergency was in effect. Saboteurs `` forced the workers of the Inguli Hydroelectric Station to start letting the waters out of the <LOCATION> Inguli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservoir </LOCATION>, and they virtually forced a halt in the operation of the power plant,'' reported the Georgian newspaper Zarya Vostoka. The dam provides more than half of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s electricity, and factories in cities throughout the republic suffered blackouts until power could be patched in from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. The story did not clearly state how much water was released from the dam. It said the water loss will lead to less electricity and predicted a power shortage in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> next winter. It said the republic's energy supplies already have been restricted by the closure of the nuclear power station in nearby <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The nuclear plant was closed because of fears of earthquakes. Shooting was reported on highways near <LOCATION> Ochamchira </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gudauta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Zarya </PERSON> <PERSON> Vostoka </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported clashes between armed groups in the regions around <LOCATION> Gulripsh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ochamchira </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sukhumi </LOCATION>. Police in <LOCATION> Sukhumi </LOCATION> had been forced to `` give way to the demands of people tortured by fear and rumors, who surrounded the district <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> building and demanded the return of their hunting weapons for self-defense,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>. Authorities confiscated more than 2,500 firearms and 466 pounds of explosives, according to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. The violence has claimed at least 18 lives since it began Saturday in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>, a 3,320-mile autonomous region in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that 339 people have been injured, including 30 policemen and seven internal security troops. At least 132 people have died in ethnic unrest in the past month in the southern Soviet republics of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION>. Georgians outnumber Abkhazians 240,000 to 90,000 in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> and both sides claim discrimination by the other. Many Abkhazians demand that it be designated a 16th Soviet republic. Authorities banned visitors to the region, where millions of tourists vacation every year, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Special flights are evacuating the thousands of tourists who are stranded in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> by interrupted road and rail transport, <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said rail lines southeast to <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> were restored Thursday but the northwest line to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> was still closed. Authorities stopped vacationers from going to the seaside area, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Under a state of emergency, large outside gatherings are forbidden, private cars are banned and all firearms must be surrendered to authorities. An 11 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew also was in effect.

 <PERSON> Atiqullah </PERSON>, 7, was caught in a cross fire and his wounds became infected. He would have died like countless others, but foreign volunteers found him and took him away for treatment in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Tens of thousands of children are among the estimated 1.3 million victims of the civil war that has ravaged <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for 11 years. Fighting has disrupted access to much of the mountainous nation. Moslem guerrillas control most of the countryside and the communist government's army has the cities. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> says fewer than 30 percent of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 10 million people have access to medical treatment and three of 10 children die before their fifth birthday, the highest infant mortality rate in the world At least one in 10 Afghan children suffers from disease or injuries related to the war. <PERSON> Atiqullah </PERSON>'s wounds could have been treated after he was shot seven months ago, but they remained open and became infected because of a shortage of surgeons and antibiotics in the deteriorating health-care system. Ultimately, however, <PERSON> Atiqullah </PERSON> was among the lucky ones. On Monday, he boarded an airplane for the first time in his life to begin a journey that may see him fully recovered and back home in a year. He was one of 20 children who arrived in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on Thursday for advanced medical treatment arranged by a West German volunteer organization. `` If he is left here, he is going to die in four weeks,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoma </PERSON> of Friedensdorf -LRB- Peace Village -RRB- International. `` He is in a devastating state.'' `` What we see -LRB- in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> -RRB- makes us sick,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gegenfurtner </PERSON>, president of Friedensdorf International. `` Imagine what is happening in the countryside. `` We are shocked to see the large number of innocent Afghan children who are suffering from a war aided by so-called civilized countries and superpowers.'' The <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government is sponsored by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports the Moslem guerrillas who have fought it since a communist coup in April 1978. Friedensdorf International came to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December and has helped treat at least 88 children wounded in the war. About 25 of them have returned home. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>, a Friedensdorf spokesman in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said the latest group flew out of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Monday during rocket attacks. Three girls and 17 boys aged 5-12 were in the group. <PERSON> Thoma </PERSON> said at least seven had bone marrow infections and `` to get them cured, we will have to operate several times.'' `` There is no way you can perform these operations in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` The hospitals here just do n't have the facilities. `` In some hospitals, they do n't have bandages. They use ordinary cloth, sometimes torn from the garments of victims, to tie up wounds.'' <PERSON> Gegenfurtner </PERSON> said members of <ORGANIZATION> Friedensdorf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> would return in three months to pick up another group of children.

 A Turkish native once employed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> as a mechanic was convicted Thursday of conspiring with a soldier to sell <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military secrets to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated about 6 -LCB- hours Wednesday afternoon and Thursday before finding <PERSON> Huseyin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON>, 61, guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit espionage. He could be sentenced to 30 years and life in prison for his part in a scheme to steal secrets from the super-secret <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> from 1983 to 1988. Experts have said the plot did significant damage to American intelligence efforts because Eastern bloc nations got access to information on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronic eavesdropping capability. Defense attorney <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> said he would move for a new trial within a week. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Avant </PERSON> <PERSON> Edenfield </PERSON> said he would schedule sentencing after a pre-sentence investigation is conducted. <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON>, who worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> as a civilian mechanic in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, was accused of conspiring with Warrant Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to sell classified information to Eastern bloc. Hall was an analyst of intercepted radio and telephone traffic and coded messages. <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON> worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> as a civilian mechanic in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The trial was held in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was stationed at nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stewart </LOCATION> at the time of his arrest last December. <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON> now lives in <LOCATION> Belleair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Hall pleaded guilty at a court-martial in March He was sentenced to 40 years in prison and dishonorably discharged from the service. Hall did not testify in the trial, although the jury saw him in a secretly made videotape which implicated <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON> as his contact with East German agents. <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON> was n't called to testify, and the defense presented no evidence. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> told the jury in his closing statement that <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was solely to blame for the espionage. `` The evidence you heard is sufficient to convict him -LRB- Hall -RRB-, but not my man,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> told the jury. `` Mr. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> is very definitely a guilty man. The man is not capable of being believed.'' According to prosecution witnesses, <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON> carried documents to the Soviets and East Germans and then returned with money for Hall. Incriminating evidence, including a letter described as a `` shopping list'' of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military information, was seized by authorities at the homes of Hall and <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Coal miners walked off their jobs in five more regions, but the Siberian strikers who started the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest in decades were told Thursday to return to work by dawn Friday. `` We have agreed to interrupt the strike, not to end it,'' said <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akulov </PERSON>, a strike committee member in <LOCATION> Prokopyevsk </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>. The strike committee asked the estimated 150,000 strikers in the region to return to the pits at dawn Friday after a government and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> commission agreed to give them greater control over their industry, <PERSON> Akulov </PERSON> said. The commission also agreed to improve the miners' food, housing and working conditions. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said the concessions granted the miners in the <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> region will apply to all miners nationwide. State-run TV repeated that promise Thursday night in an apparent effort to end the country's worst labor unrest since the 1920s. Some Siberian miners have already returned to work. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said nine out of 11 mining centers were operating, and <LOCATION> Prokopyevsk </LOCATION>'s central Victory Square was empty Thursday night after nearly two weeks of rallies and demonstrations by thousands of strikers But the strike spread in other areas as miners raised demands similar to those of the <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> strikers, who began the walkout 10 days ago. Miners in the northern town of <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Don </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Rostov </LOCATION> and the Ukrainian industrial center of <LOCATION> Dnepropetrovsk </LOCATION>, walked out Wednesday with demands similar to those of the strike instigators in <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Dnepropetrovsk </LOCATION> is in the <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> coal basin, the nation's leading coal region. On Thursday, more than 16,000 miners in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Karaganda </LOCATION> region, the country's third-largest coal field, refused to go down into the pits and were massing by the thousands for rallies, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> and the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported Miners at three shafts in <LOCATION> Chervonograd </LOCATION> in the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> joined the walkout Thursday night, said <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotsenko </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Official news reports did not say how many miners were on strike nationwide. The coal industry employs more than 1 million workers. <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> workers striking at nine of the city's 13 mines asked the Kremlin for an `` urgent resolution of the sharp economic and social problems of the coal sector, and also specific problems of workers of the far north,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Miners in <LOCATION> Rostov </LOCATION> demanded extra pay for evening and night shifts, longer vacations and an increase in the price of coal to world market prices, the news agency reported. Workers striking at 11 mines in <LOCATION> Dnepropetrovsk </LOCATION> made 24 demands similar to those of the <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> miners, reports said. <LOCATION> Karaganda </LOCATION> strikers said they walked out to protest incomplete news accounts of miners' demands in the <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> strikes, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. The government compromised on most of the 39 demands made by the <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> miners, who walked off the job July 11. One of the biggest demands was for economic independence. <PERSON> Akulov </PERSON> said that starting Jan. 1, the <LOCATION> Kuznetzk </LOCATION> coal basin will become economically autonomous. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> will continue to run the mines, but the miners will have a much greater say setting production levels and allocating the profits,'' said <PERSON> Akulov </PERSON>, one of two representatives on the regional strike committee from the town of <LOCATION> Anzhero-Sudzhensk </LOCATION>, the northern-most coal settlement in <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION>. Television quoted Coal Minister <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shchadov </PERSON> as saying all Soviet coal operations would become economically independent. <PERSON> Akulov </PERSON>, whose weathered, gaunt face is typical of the miners in the region, said the <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> miners would hold the government to its word. `` If the government does n't keep its promises, we will go back on strike. That's in the agreement,'' he said. He and other strike leaders described the settlement negotiations as `` open and very constructive.'' `` Our politics have gotten freer under perestroika,'' said <PERSON> Akulov </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reform program. `` But our living conditions have not improved.'' Another strike committee member, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kukaletov </PERSON>, said housing conditions remain poor and there were severe shortages of sugar, other foods and consumer goods. <LOCATION> Prokopyevsk </LOCATION>'s small wooden huts cling to the rolling hills and expansive birch forests of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. Some houses, most of which are heated by coal-burning stoves during the long winter, sit next to piles of slag and other mine debris. The youth newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said the government has promised to send extra meat, butter, sugar, tea, leather footwear, furniture and cars to relieve shortages in the region.

 Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has shifted its emphasis from fighting inflation to avoiding a recession, a signal that the central bank likely will continue to cautiously push down interest rates. `` Recent developments suggest that the balance of risks may have shifted somewhat away from greater inflation,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on domestic monetary policy. `` ... What we seek to avoid is an unnecessary and destructive recession.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, in his semiannual report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed that after a yearlong campaign of trying to curb inflationary pressures by nudging up interest rates, the central bank has reversed course in response to widespread evidence of economic softness. He said he did not see signs of a recession `` at the moment,'' but conceded that `` some day, some event will end the extraordinary string of economic advances that has prevailed since late 1982.'' He added that he did not want a mistake by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to be the cause. The central bank chairman would not respond directly when asked by panel members whether interest rates would continue to decline, but he indicated he did not soon forsee another shift in policy. `` It is not desirable to do too many wiggles,'' he said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> loosened its grip on credit twice _ once in early June and again early in July _ and that the stimulating effects of lower interest rates were just now beginning to be felt. Private economists interpreted the central bank chairman's remarks as a clear sign that monetary policymakers, with caution, would continue to allow interest rates to fall as a stimulant to economic activity `` My feeling is ... he's willing to ease further, particularly if there's further sign of softness in the industrial sector,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Elsewhere on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief economic adviser, praised the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s recent action to lower interest rates, but declined to say what he thought the central bank's next move should be `` I do n't like to preach to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in public,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. However, earlier this year, when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was pushing interest rates higher, both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> did n't hesitate to say they thought <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and his colleagues were overly concerned with inflation. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was gratified by the government's two most recent inflation reports, for June, showing a modest 0.2 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index and a small 0.1 percent decline in wholesale prices. But, he cautioned, `` It's clearly premature, with one month's data, to suggest that inflation pressures are behind us Certainly they are not.'' And, he said, `` inflation remains high _ clearly above our objective.'' Economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm, said <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s testimony indicates monetary policy makers will not move precipitously. `` They're not quite sure that inflation is as dead as it looks now. As long as they're not, they're going to move as slowly as they can get away with,'' he said. In setting preliminary monetary growth targets, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had decided to leave the growth rates unchanged for this year and next year as well. For M-2, the measure of the money supply which includes currency in circulation and interest-bearing checking accounts, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said it would aim for an increase of between 3 percent and 7 percent both this year and in 1990. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> also released a revised economic forecast which showed that the central bank still hopes to achieve a so-called soft landing in which growth will slow enough to cool inflationary pressures but not decline so much that the country is thrown into a recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> predicted modest economic growth, as measured by the gross national product, of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent this year, slowing to 1.5 percent to 2 percent in 1990. That compares with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's more optimistic projection of 2.7 percent in 1989 and 2.6 percent in 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday forecast a 2.4 percent rate of growth this year, slowing to 2 percent in 1990. The central bank forecast that consumer prices would rise by between 5 percent and 5.5 percent this year, up from last year's 4.4 percent increase, and slowing to between 4.5 percent and 5 percent in 1990 The administration, meanwhile, is looking for a 5 percent rise in consumer prices this year and 4.1 percent next year. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> is looking for inflation a half point higher than the administration, in the upper range of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 projection.

<TEXT>
 African foreign ministers agreed in principle Thursday to form a pan-African military force to help black states resist incursions by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The Organization of African Unity's council of ministers adopted a recommendation calling for a joint defense force but put off its creation pending a study on how it would be funded. The 50-member <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> has been plagued by financial problems throughout its 26-year history. Many members are badly behind on their annual dues. The organization has considered assembling a similar force in the past, but the idea has never passed the conceptual stage. <PERSON> Sylvestre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nganzimana </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> assistant secretary, said the proposed force would be made up of military units from members nations which could be called up as a unified force. `` What is envisioned is a force that would assist the frontline states, which have suffered incursions and destabilization by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It would also work closely with national liberation organizations and act as a peacekeeping and observer force.'' The financial study was not due to be completed until next year. The <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION>'s defense commission, which brought the recommendation to the council, noted in its report that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> estimates the cost of keeping one of its typical peacekeeping forces in the field for six months at about $ 150 million. The frontline states comprise <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. The foreign ministers were meeting in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s capital city this week to draw up an agenda for a conference of <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> heads of state. The meeting opens Monday.

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no right to compensation from the Italian government for <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s seizure of an American-owned plant 21 years ago. The five-judge panel ruled 4-1 that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> did not breach the 1948 Treaty of Friendship, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navigation </ORGANIZATION>, as alleged by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, when it seized the <PERSON> Elettronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Sicula </PERSON>, or ELSI, plant in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> in 1968. It also voted 4-1 to deny compensation to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwebel </PERSON>, the court's only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> judge, opposed the decision. <ORGANIZATION> ELSI </ORGANIZATION> was a cathode-ray tube factory wholly owned by <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a major defense contractor, and by another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> company, <ORGANIZATION> Machlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> contended the mayor of <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> seized the company to safeguard the jobs of about 900 factory workers after the owners announced plans to liquidate the firm According to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaint, the company was then sold to a subsidiary of a conglomerate owned by the Italian government `` at a price far less than market value,'' and <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> was never compensated. No specific compensation amounts were demanded in court, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources have claimed privately that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> damages in the case were more than $ 6 million. The court, officially known as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, is the legal arm of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. It has no enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its decisions. In court, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> complained that a ruling on the case by an Italian court was delayed 16 months after the seizure until <ORGANIZATION> ELSI </ORGANIZATION> was sold. The judges said <ORGANIZATION> ELSI </ORGANIZATION> was on a `` course to bankruptcy'' even before it was seized. `` What really deprived <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Machlett </PERSON> as shareholders of their right to dispose of <ORGANIZATION> ELSI </ORGANIZATION>'s ... property was not the requisition but the precarious financial state of <ORGANIZATION> ELSI </ORGANIZATION> ultimately leading inescapably to bankruptcy,'' they said. Voting in favor were the court's Argentinian president, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruda </PERSON>, as well as judges <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ago </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shigeru </PERSON> <PERSON> Oda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and Sir <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schwebel </PERSON> said in a separate document attached to the ruling that <ORGANIZATION> ELSI </ORGANIZATION>'s seizure was an `` unreasonable and capricious'' measure that `` deprived <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> of its right to control and manage and, hence, liquidate ELSI.'' The ELSI case was filed in February 1987 after years of diplomatic bargaining failed to resolve the issue. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> denounced U.S.-sponsored military action against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the anti-Sandinista forces known as Contras. Earlier that year, in an apparent anticipation of the adverse decision, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> withdrew its recognition of the unlimited jurisdiction of the court but said it would continue to accept jurisdiction in some cases, such as the one involving <PERSON> Elettronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Sicula </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s former personal aide testified Thursday in his federal tax evasion trial he did n't have any way to prove that cash advances he took while at the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry were for business use. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said under cross-examination by prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> that proper record keeping would have helped determine whether sums of money he drew from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> accounts were taxable or not. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, 32, and his brother, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, are charged with evading $ 525,000 in income taxes after taking nearly $ 1.2 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money for their own use during a four-year period beginning in 1984. Under questioning by defense lawyer <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON>, <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said that as a vice president of the ministry, he had direct authority from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to take large cash advances, sign <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> checks, use <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> credit cards and authorize bonuses for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> employees. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said he left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in early 1983 because of exhaustion and job burnout. He said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, called him numerous times with generous offers to entice him to return. `` He told me ` <PERSON> David </PERSON>, you've killed yourself for the ministry for $ 25,000 a year -LRB- as assistant music director from 1978 to 1980 and from 1980 to 1983 as <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s personal assistant -RRB-. Now the ministry is in a different position and I'm willing to pay you $ 100,000 a year,'' <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said he recalled telling <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, `` I want access to the same resources that you have. But I also want to control my money. I do n't want a house or a car to be given to me.'' <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said that on his return, he had authority to take large cash advances, which he said were used primarily for trips by the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> on ministry business. He said he needed large amounts of cash on hand at all times. `` Many times on a trip I would advance <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> some cash and she would reimburse it,'' he said. That was true of dozens of other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' entourage, he said. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> James </PERSON> testified Wednesday that as <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s interior designer he was an artist who left the business dealings to his brother `` I always have been lax about documentation. It's never been a priority,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>'s testimony came a day after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> invoked the Fifth Amendment in refusing to answer questions in the trial. His 10-minute appearance was with the jury not present. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and former top <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> are scheduled to go on trial Aug. 28 on conspiracy and wire and mail fraud charges.

<HEAD>House Panel Holds Hearing on Joint Newspapers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Legislation allowing rival newspapers to publish under a Joint Operating Agreement fails to save daily newspapers and should be repealed, the editor of a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> weekly told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Thursday. `` It has encouraged concentration of newspaper ownership, peculiar competitive practices and lessened the vigor and quality of newspapering,'' <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> editor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendover </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> panel. However, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedheim </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, testified that the act `` helped the marketplace evolve and prosper.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, called the hearing 19 years after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved the Newspaper Preservation Act, which allows newspapers in the same city to merge business operations when one of the papers is in danger of failing. Newsgathering operations remain separate. `` In 1970, the act was hailed as a necessary means of preventing daily newspapers from falling victim to fierce market forces,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said. `` Yet, since passage of the act, some estimate that over 200 papers have ceased operation.'' <LOCATION> Wendover </LOCATION>, editor and publisher of the weekly <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crier </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Plymouth-Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, testified on behalf of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Citizens </LOCATION> for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. That group, made up of 1,400 readers, advertisers and employees of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, filed a lawsuit in August to block a JOA between the two papers. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns The News, and <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, say the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> is needed to allow the Free Press to survive The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will hear arguments on the case this fall. There are 18 active JOAs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The principle of a free press can not be maintained when the biggest newspaper chains enjoy unregulated monopoly status,'' Wendover said, calling on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to repeal the act. Harsh criticism came from <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brugmann </PERSON>, editor and publisher of the 70,000 circulation weekly <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardian </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brugmann </PERSON> also testified against the act when it was being considered in 1969. `` Never have so many given so much to so few for no good reason at all,'' <PERSON> Brugmann </PERSON> said, charging that the only people to benefit from JOAs are publishers. The <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> between the two <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> dailies, the Examiner and the <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brugmann </PERSON> said, has led to less competitive journalism. Also critical of the act was <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mleczko </PERSON>, a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and president of Local 22 of The Newspaper Guild of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mleczko </PERSON>, who is opposed to the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should repeal the act and force giant chains to compete. `` Newspapers are more than just businesses, only concerned with the bottom line. They are a public trust,'' <PERSON> Mleczko </PERSON> said. `` The Robber Barons live. It's time for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to break up the trusts again.'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said his Economic and <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> would study the testimony and decide whether further hearings are needed.

 A <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> meat packer, convicted last year on two counts of bribery, has signed an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to sell or close two companies, officials said Thursday. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mander </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Provision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was convicted in 1988 of bribing a federal meat grader The department then moved to withdraw federal inspection from both companies.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s income growth, driven by the state's tourism and mining industries, outpaced other states during the year ending last March, while income growth in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> trailed the rest of the country, the government reported Thursday The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said said that non-farm incomes rose 9.4 percent nationally in the 12 months ending March 30. But the national average masked disparities among states and regions of the country. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> paced the country with a non-farm income increase of 15 percent, the department said. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s income growth was fueld by the hotel and resort construction demands of its tourism industry and a healthy mining industry, according to department analyst <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> DePass </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> was followed by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> whose non-farm income was up 12.1 percent; <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, up 10.7 percent; <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, up 10.5 percent, and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, up 10.5 percent. With inflation rising at an annual rate of 5.9 percent, the figures showed those states stayed well ahead of the increase in prices. Other states did not fare so well. Last-ranked <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> saw non-farm income growth rise only 5.7 percent, pulled down by declining construction and services industry, <PERSON> DePass </PERSON> said. Other states at the bottom-end of the rankings were <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, up 6.3 percent; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, up 6.4 percent; <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, up 6.9 percent, and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, up 7.2 percent. By region, the Far West led the nation with an overall income growth of 10.5 percent, followed by the Southeast, 9.9 percent; and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, 9.6 percent. Other regions and their income growth rates were: Great Lakes, 9 percent; <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION>, 8.9 percent; <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, 8.8 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, 8.6 percent, and <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, 8.2 percent. <PERSON> DePass </PERSON> said differences in non-farm income growth between coastal and interior regions continued to grow smaller from the first quarter of 1988 to the first quarter of 1989, although coastal growth continued to outpace the inland areas. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> focuses on changes in non-farm income as a better indication of a region's prosperity because of the often erratic nature of farm incomes.

 If <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> _ that aficionado of big guns, feisty bulls, lusty reds and really short sentences _ were alive today, the pugnacious Papa would be spoiling for a fight. The object of his disaffection would be `` The Best of Bad Hemingway'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION>, $ 7.95 -RRB-, a compilation of the best entries to a now-defunct annual competition of Hemingway parodies. The ersatz <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> contest was sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grill </ORGANIZATION>, whose ingenious milking of an extremely tenuous <LOCATION> Hemingway </LOCATION> connection deserves induction into the Publicists' Hall of Fame. <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, who would have been 90 on July 21, was no stranger to parody. His second novel, `` The Torrents of Spring,'' was a cruel mimickry of <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, an early mentor <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> thought was washed up. But when his own prose became well enough known to be parodied, <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> was hardly a sport. `` The parody is the last refuge of the frustrated writer,'' he said after E.B. White spoofed him with a piece called `` Across the Street and Into the Grill.'' `` The greater the work of literature, the easier the parody. The step up from writing parodies is writing on the wall above the urinal.'' All of the Ernie-wannabees in this collection are long on puns and short on commas. Among the titles: `` The Snooze of Kilimanjaro,'' `` In Another Contra,'' `` Hills Like White Heffalumps,'' `` The Old Man and the Seal,'' `` A Clean Well-Sighted Ace,'' `` A Lean Well-Tighted Space'' and `` A Clean Well-Lighted Race.'' When author <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Plimpton </PERSON>, who wrote the introduction to the book, was asked in a recent interview to select a favorite entry, he mentioned <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>'s `` The Last Good Martini,'' which mangles more than a half-dozen Hemingway titles in its few short paragraphs: `` ` Do you want to order dinner?' said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON>. ` They still serve the big two-parted liver.''' And later: `` ` Do you remember <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tell </PERSON>?' `` ` Yes,' said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>. ` He was a swell bowler. For whom does Tell bowl now?''' <PERSON> Plimpton </PERSON> also mentioned the parody by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>, `` The Question Hung in the Air'': `` He knew what they must do on this day. It was a month with no R. `` ` Come,' he said. ` It is the day of the running of the oysters.''' <PERSON> Plimpton </PERSON> explains in his introduction that the parody contest was dreamed up in 1978 by an advertising man named <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Keye </PERSON> for <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grill </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Century </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. The American <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s was a replica of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s Bar in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Keye </PERSON> knew <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> never went to the <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> but was a devotee of the original <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s Bar in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> and often featured it in his stories. His copy promoting the competition warned contestants that they would have to face `` The White Bull That Is Paper With No Words on It.'' All entries had to be limited to one type-written page and had to mention <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s Bar _ favorably. The winner was flown to <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> for dinner at the other <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s -LRB- lodging was not included -RRB-. The thousands of entries that poured in took the contest organizers by surprise, and the contest grew bigger every year, with celebrity judges such as <PERSON> Plimpton </PERSON>, novelist <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON>, science fiction writer <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradbury </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, the author's son. Television crews gathered for the reading of the winning entry. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s decided to end the competition after a decade because it was devoting more time to running it than its restaurants. <PERSON> Plimpton </PERSON> was asked what he looked for when he judged the entries. `` It has to be funny; it has to echo the style of author. I think the skill in copying the primary source would be utmust, then the imagination in developing the idea,'' he said by telephone from his office at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Review, of which he is editor. In later years the entries were pre-screened and the judges read only the best entries. `` The Best of Bad Hemingway'' is rounded out by spoofs of the author by well-known writers, including <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Plimpton </PERSON> himself, whose `` The Snows of Studiofiftyfour'' is a skillful mutation of <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>'s writing style and a Truman Capote-esque sensibility. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Piepenbrink </PERSON>, who edited the collection for <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION>, said he thought the book was fairly evenly divided between those who parodied <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> because they loved him and those who did it because they reviled him. <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1954, put a shotgun in his mouth and committed suicide in 1961. `` He's a literary force that everyone will have reckoned with somehow,'' said <PERSON> Piepenbrink </PERSON> in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> office. `` His stature is not to be challenged. His place is secure in modern literature. `` I do n't think the collection diminishes <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Piepenbrink </PERSON>, who reveres the author. `` Some of the parodies are pretty cruel, but he can take it. A lesser writer could n't endure all these punches.''

 Getting a tan in order to improve your looks raises your risk of skin cancer, wrinkles, eye damage and changes in the skin's immune system, a new report says. No health benefits are known from cosmetic tanning, except that `` tanned skin may have positive psychological value by creating an enhanced image of personal worth,'' said the report by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The price can be high _ premature wrinkles, dryness and leathery skin; a heightened risk of skin cancer; damage to the eyes, and genetic changes that may compromise the skin's ability to fight invaders, the report said. `` Despite the hazards, many people can not be dissuaded from sunbathing or using artificial tanning devices,'' said the report, written by the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and published in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The council recommended these guidelines for people who insist on tanning: _ Minimize exposure to ultraviolet radiation, the component of sunlight that causes tanning and burning, by staying out of the sun between 10 a.m and 2 p.m. and wearing a hat and protective clothing _ Beware of surfaces such as sand, snow, ice and concrete that reflect sunlight and can intensify the effects of the sun's rays by 10 percent to 50 percent _ Use a sunscreen, with a sun protection factor of at least 15 for skin that burns easily or tans only gradually, or higher at greater elevations or for other intensive exposures A person wearing a sunscreen with a protection factor of 15 would get the same amount of radiation exposure after 15 hours in the sun as he would in one hour if he were wearing no sunscreen. _ Keep babies out of the sun as much as possible and apply sunscreen to older youngsters who are to be outdoors for long periods _ Avoid tanning machines Exposure to their radiation may increase the risk of skin cancer, even though most modern machines use the `` safer'' form of ultraviolet light, called UV-A, rather than the more dangerous form, UV-B. People with extremely fair skin or severe reactions to sunlight should never use such booths, it said. If tanning equipment is used, people who tan moderately well should limit their exposures to 30 to 50 half-hour sessions per year or less, use a properly calibrated device with a timer, keep a record of exposures, wear protective goggles and make sure an attendant is nearby in case of an emergency, the report said. <PERSON> Becca </PERSON> <PERSON> Essman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Suntanning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group, reacted to the report by saying that tanning parlor operators have already responded to medical concerns about radiation. `` Tanning is a part of life that probably will never go away,'' she said in a telephone interview from the association's headquarters in <LOCATION> Frederick </LOCATION>, Md `` And we think indoor tanning facilities give people in general an opportunity to not burn, to avoid the overexposure.'' The association's 1,500 member facilities make up about one-quarter of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indoor tanning industry, Ms. <PERSON> Essman </PERSON> said. The group has drafted a code of ethics, developed a training program for parlor operators and promotes safety measures, she said. The Council on Scientific Affairs is a 15-member panel of doctors and other health specialists whose job is to compile the latest scientific information on topics of interest to the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Study: Suicide Second Leading Cause of Death Among Maryland Immates</HEAD>

 Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> prison inmates, according to federal researchers who suggest that convicts be examined for mental health problems before incarceration. Scientists from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, found that mentally disturbed inmates were at the highest risk of committing suicide. White, male prisoners ages 15 to 34 had a greater risk of killing themselves than the general prison population, the researchers said in Friday's edition of the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Prisoners in that age group also tended to kill themselves twice as often as people of the same age in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s general population, the researchers wrote. `` I think the situation of prisoners in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> is the same as that in many states,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Division for Correction. `` They are faced with long prison sentences and a loss of hope that puts them in a very depressed state.'' Dr. <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Salive </PERSON> from the center and fellow scientists studied 206 deaths of male convicts in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> state prisons between 1979 to 1987 and found 37 were by suicide, second only to heart disease, which killed 48 inmates. The researchers noted that their results could not be applied to the nation's prison population, estimated at about 500,000, because suicide rates vary from prison to prison and the type of prison population. <PERSON> Salive </PERSON> said the absence of suicides among women inmates might be explained by the fact that women make up only 3.5 percent of the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> prison population. The researchers said psychotic or psychiatrically disturbed inmates are at the highest risk. The researchers suggested that convicts be evaluated for mental health problems before incarceration. In addition, `` We should train the staff to be more watchful of pre-suicidal behavior, such as people who get depressed or isolate themselves or have attempted it in the past,'' <PERSON> Salive </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Of the prison suicides, 32 inmates hanged themselves, two slashed themselves, two overdosed on drugs and one fell to his death. White prisoners are twice as likely as blacks to commit suicide, the researchers said. They also confirmed previous studies that found inmates who serve a life sentence are more likely to commit suicide than other prisoners. Most studies of inmate suicides have been done in local jails, which house newly arrested people as well as convicts, the authors said. Prisons hold only those convicted and sentenced. Suicide is the leading cause of death in jails and is nine times more common in jail populations than in the general population, said <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, an assistant director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> and Alternatives, a private, <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, Va.-based group seeking better jail conditions. Suicides are less common in prisons than jails, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. Because only convicted felons are sent to prison, `` they've been through the crisis of jail and they are hardened, more experienced, and less fearful of the unknown,'' he said. <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> prison officials are trying to fight the suicide problem by installing in some cells collapsible clothing racks that will not support the weight of a body. In addition to removing pipes and clothes and towel racks or making them collapsible, corrections systems can help prevent inmate suicide by making tearable prison clothing, sheets and blankets that can not support a body, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. `` I do n't like gimmicks, though,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. `` I prefer counseling and increased monitoring. Suicides are best prevented by other human beings.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> and other top officials tried to rally support Thursday for their proposal to declare a truce in the <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> war. They were reacting to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s praise of the idea Wednesday. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said he agreed with the proposal by <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> this year for a truce before <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s pullout <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978 and installed the current government, has said it will pull its 60,000 to 70,000 forces out by Sept. 30. It said it will do so even without a settlement. However, <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> said on official Radio <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>: `` The Cambodian issue can not be solved peacefully without a cease-fire. `` Therefore, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> fully supports the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> prime minister's proposal that the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> parties sign a cease-fire agreement in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, and considers this as part of a political solution to the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> issue,'' he said The broadcast was monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. Asked for his reaction Thursday, <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> said he had not yet received the report. But he added that `` if the four Cambodian parties agree, it would be great.'' The Cambodian government has been battling a coalition of three guerrilla groups, including the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The communist group ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> for almost four years, killing hundreds of thousands, until they were driven out by the Vietnamese. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> told reporters the truce issue should be raised at an international conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> starting Sunday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. He said a truce could be signed there, but he added that he thinks it will be impossible to get the Cambodian factions to agree on it. Cambodian government leader <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, chief of the three-party guerrilla coalition, in May agreed in principle to a cease-fire. But the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the largest and most hard-line guerrilla force, rejected a truce unless Vietnamese forces first withdraw under international supervision. Another Radio <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> broadcast Thursday said <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> the day before en route to the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> talks and conferred with Prime Minister Do Muoi and Thach. The radio said the two sides agreed that the basis for a solution lay in what they said was the consensus reached at two rounds of talks in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> the past year _ the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and `` elimination'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has demanded a government joining the <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> administration and all three guerrilla groups, but <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> has rejected <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> participation because he says it would ignite more war. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> apparently plans no major concessions. The official Cambodian news agency <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> said he told a Australian official visiting Phnom Penh Monday that he was prepared for more fighting if need be.

<TEXT>
 Two congresswomen, saying they want to reclaim the `` middle ground'' in the abortion debate, Thursday introduced a bill to fund birth control and fertility research. Reps. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., and <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, said they are trying to broaden the abortion-rights base and seize control of the debate from abortion foes by attracting people from both sides of the issue as well as the undecided `` This is a comfort zone for people who do n't want to line up for or against abortion,'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said. `` We're not going to sidetrack the debate on abortion,'' Snow said, but the congresswomen want to broaden it to address the conditions that lead to the need for abortion. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling earlier this month giving the states broader authority to limit women's rights to terminate their pregnancies has thrown the abortion debate into the state legislatures and governors' offices. Abortion-rights advocates and opponents have been bracing to steer the issue in their states. `` We've got to start reclaiming that middle ground'' to broaden the pro-choice base and reach out to people who may be uncomfortable in either camp on abortion but who support the need for better contraception, <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said. With more than 3 million unintended pregnancies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year, more attention has to be focused on preventing pregnancies, they said. Additionally, one out of six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> couples is infertile or can not conceive within one year of deciding to have a child, they said. `` Clearly, we need to encourage birth control and fertility research,'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said. Currently, the federal government is spending about $ 9 million annually on contraceptive research, she said. The bill would fund three birth control research centers and two fertility research centers that would do clinical research and development as well as develop education programs and distribute medical information. The centers would receive $ 20 million in fiscal year 1990, the same amount in 1991, $ 12 million in fiscal 1992, $ 12.5 million in fiscal 1993 and $ 13 million for fiscal 1994. The bill would also authorize a loan repayment program for graduate students or health professionals who conduct birth control or fertility research.

<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state's transportation board on Thursday approved plans for a private toll highway that the builder said would be the first in the country in 30 years. The <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously to approve the <ORGANIZATION> Toll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s proposal to build a 15-mile, $ 155 million extension of the <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Toll </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> in traffic-clogged northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The vote came after intense negotiations between the state and the corporation, which is headed by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, former chief of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've got a lot to be proud of,'' said <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON>, northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s representative on the board. `` We're willing to look at creative and new ways to meet our state's needs.'' The company still must seek approval from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which will regulate the amount of tolls. The company has said tolls would start at $ 1.50. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said he hopes the <ORGANIZATION> SCC </ORGANIZATION> will act as soon as possible and construction can begin by December. He said the highway should be finished by the end of 1991, about 15 months ahead of when the state could complete the project. `` We could n't be more pleased, particularly with a unanimous vote,'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said. `` I do n't minimize the historic nature of it,'' he said. `` I think it's a whole new era of funding for not just highway projects but infrastructure through the state.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodwell </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Toll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said land for the project is largely being donated by developers and other landowners on the assumption the road will increase the value of land near it. The company is still negotiating with some small individual owners, and may have to buy some parcels. The land donations are one of the main reasons the company will be able to build the road so much faster than the state, <PERSON> Woodwell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said the road would be the first private toll highway built in the country in more than 30 years. `` There are, I would say, at least 30 states I know who are going to be very interested in what happened here today,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation in 1988 allowing private companies to fund and build roads in the state. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said he could foresee more private funding of roads, bridges and wastewater treatment plants, particularly in small communities. State transportation officials acknowledged that the private company could build the road faster and at a lower initial cost, but they said it would cost far more in the long run because the company must pay higher interest rates than the state. That would increase tolls, they said. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pethtel </PERSON>, the board's commissioner, said the public's overwhelming support for the private road outweighed such concerns

<HEAD>Dispute Over Captured Germans Who Helped Soviets In War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An emotional dispute has broken out in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over whether imprisoned German soldiers who spread propaganda for their Soviet captors during World War II were traitors or heroes. `` Many people consider these people traitors. But that's not the case. They were opponents of the -LRB- Nazi -RRB- regime,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Steinbach </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Passau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> historian, arranged an exhibit called `` Resistance to National Socialism'' that has generated controversy. The failed July 20, 1944 attempt by German generals to kill <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> is included in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> exhibit, as are the wartime calls for anti-Nazi actions by a group of university students known as the White Rose. In both cases, those brave enough to oppose <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> were tortured and executed. But along with documents and photographs showing such widely recognized attempts to disrupt the Third Reich is a controversial display about thousands of captured German soldiers in Soviet prisons who opposed the Third Reich and wanted the war to end. Some members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for a Free <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> did propaganda work for the Soviets during the war, using loudspeakers at the front to urge German soldiers to quit fighting. That part of the exhibit has angered Germans who do not believe the soldiers deserve the same place of honor as people like <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Stauffenberg </PERSON>, who was executed for planting the 1944 bomb meant to kill <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hartmut </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoesslin </PERSON>, brother of another German officer involved in the 1944 plot, Maj. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoesslin </PERSON>, was at the exhibit's opening on Wednesday <PERSON> Hartmut </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoesslin </PERSON> said the display on imprisoned German soldiers `` insulted all resistance-fighters.'' A protest letter presented by <PERSON> Hartmut </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoesslin </PERSON> to the exhibit's organizers said propaganda by the imprisoned soldiers amounted to `` psychoterror'' against fellow German troops. But <PERSON> Steinbach </PERSON> said members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germany </ORGANIZATION> deserve a place in the exhibit and argued they saw themselves not as opportunists who wanted to placate Soviet captors, but as authentic opponents of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s rule. `` They felt they were representatives of the Allied cause to stop the war,'' <PERSON> Steinbach </PERSON> said. The dispute has its roots in a long-standing German dilemma: what kind of honor to bestow on German soldiers who died during the war, and whether those who deserted are also deserving of praise. German peace activists have been behind numerous moves to erect monuments to World War II deserters, often angering people who feel it is an affront to those who died fighting. There is heated controversy in <LOCATION> Bockhorn </LOCATION>, where citizens are embroiled in discussion over the community's memorial to soldiers who fell during both world wars. An open letter from peace activists questioned whether every fallen soldier deserves to be treated like a hero. The letter said, `` They -LRB- the fallen soldiers -RRB- had participated in one of the greatest crimes of modern times,'' meaning the tragedies and terror begun by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> when it started World War II. <PERSON> Kark </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Schinkel </PERSON>, an officer in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> navy, said in the respected newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> that such disputes underscore the difficulties some Germans still have in coming to terms with their homeland's <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past. He said such controversies `` raise the question, 50 years after the German invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, whether the concept of individual heroism can be applied against the backdrop of mass murder.''

 Mars and the moon are lousy neighborhoods with wretched climates, but the moon's closer and people have been there before. So if you want to survive on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, first go to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and learn how to live there. That's the guiding idea behind President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s long-range space challenge to the nation. Of several options prepared by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and presented to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the moon-then-Mars plan is the most expensive and complex. But, ultimately, it could be the most rewarding. In contrast to the Apollo project, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> celebrated in his speech on Thursday, the new approach calls for a permanent presence on the moon. Instead of visiting the lunar surface like Apollo tourists, Americans would establish a base with a full-time, long-term staff. The <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> strategy calls for frequent flights to the moon and construction there of living quarters, laboratories and power stations. The lunar soil would be mined to extract oxygen which then could be turned into rocket fuel. For astronomers, the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>'s surface would offer an observatory site that is unparalleled on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The moon has no atmosphere to obscure the view of the universe, and it has only one-sixth the gravity of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, which means much larger reflector telescopes could be built. For engineers, a moon base would be a laboratory for a voyage to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. The lunar center would enable the engineers to test concepts for building permanent quarters for humans in other worlds that have no air or water. For instance, a `` closed loop'' system, where oxygen and water is processed and used over and over, could be developed. A lunar base also would enable engineers to use the moon as a starting point for a trip to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. Some experts have suggested that a Mars voyager could be built in lunar orbit, either from components built on the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, or ferried there from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Propellant for the craft could be processed from moon soil. The vehicle could then start its trip to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> by first firing out of lunar orbit, circling the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> to pick up a boost from the planet's gravity, and then streaking outward on an eight-month excursion. Once in the vicinity of Mars, the craft could put equipment on the surface and then land personnel to build a base, using the lessons learned from the moon. A base on Mars would be much more difficult than a lunar center. The red planet is blasted by massive storms in its unbreathable atmosphere of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon and oxygen. But Mars may have water, vital for human existence, and its surface may be more Earth-like than any of the other solar system planets. Another base could be built on Phobos, a moon of Mars, and soil there mined to produce oxygen and hydrogen, a combination that makes a powerful rocket propellant. Such an enterprise would not be of limited duration, as was the Apollo adventure. It would be permanent, the first step toward <LOCATION> humankind </LOCATION>'s colonizing the universe beyond the Earth. The cost would be hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars, and it would create an industry employing hundreds of thousands of people on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, and scores on the moon and <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. Why do it? The only sure benefit is new knowledge. And experts believe that the effort would cause a great leap in technology, just as Apollo boosted technology in the 1960s. Beyond that, there's national prestige. Somebody's going to do it, and the president wants it to be the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke with pride Thursday about the first footprint and the first flag on the moon being American. He'd like the first words spoken on Mars to also be American.

 An unexpected visit by a group of Soviet students and professors sent <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> officials scrambling to line up social and educational events. `` Yes, we are embarrassed. We certainly do n't make a habit of treating international visitors this way,'' said <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Munson </PERSON>, the university's student life director.

 Christians and Syrians fought artillery battles Thursday that rained 30 shells a minute on the city and sent thousands of residents fleeing in panic. Police said 13 people were killed and 88 wounded. `` Someone call the fire brigade! We want an ambulance too!'' a woman screamed from the 11-story <PERSON> Kaaki </PERSON> building in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, whose top three floors were burning. `` Telephone lines are down!'' a man answered from a nearby building. `` Have faith in God! We're coming to help you!'' Two 107mm rockets hit <PERSON> Fawzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rida </PERSON>'s apartment on the 10th floor before dawn. `` I stretched a hand to open the door, but there was no door,'' he said. `` We have nothing left but the night clothes we are wearing.'' Police said 433 people have been killed and 1,780 wounded in the 18 weeks of artillery warfare between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army units and an alliance of Syrian soldiers and Moslem militias. Thursday's shelling was some of the heaviest in the long battle. Tongues of flame shot into the sky over <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Blasted buildings burned out of control. A police spokesman said damage in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was much worse than in the Christian eastern sector. He reported a heavy flow of civilians from both sides of the city toward safer areas in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION> in the east and the mountains northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` Thousands of cars packed with families headed south from west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' the spokesman said. The evacuees used a lull in shelling at midday Thursday to leave the city, `` carrying whatever personal effects and household items they could save,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photo editor <PERSON> Zouheir </PERSON> <PERSON> Saade </PERSON> said shells fell near his fifth-floor apartment in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seaside <LOCATION> Raouche </LOCATION> district. `` Our building does n't have a bomb shelter,'' he said. `` The only precautionary measure I could take was to distribute my four sons each in a different room. I thought that was the only possible way to keep some of them alive in case the apartment was hit.'' Firefighters were hampered because a power blackout caused a water shortage. A source at the fire department said two fire engines used sea water to extinguish some fires overnight. The police spokesman said several Syrian soldiers were killed when <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s artillery pounded their bases and artillery emplacements in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, but police said they had no precise information because the Syrians do not report their losses to <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> authorities. An estimated 40,000 Syrian soldiers are in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate granted in 1976, a year after <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sectarian civil war began <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> calls them an army of occupation and has vowed to drive them out. The police spokesman said <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>'s right-wing Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia, joined <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army forces in shelling west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners targeted mainly Syrian positions,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>'s men rocketed residential areas in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.'' Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads a Moslem government vying for power with the <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded with leaders of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> to speed up Arab League efforts for a cease-fire. A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command claimed the Syrians started the battle by shelling the Christian-held coast north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to prevent three ships loaded with food from landing. The Syrians bombard the coast regularly to keep supply ships away from Christian ports.

 A pro-choice group charged Thursday that two major newspapers censored advertisements the group wanted to use to promote this week's television broadcast of its film about abortion. The Fund for the Feminist Majority, whose film `` Abortion: For Survival'' was to air Thursday and this weekend on <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>'s SuperStation <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> refused to carry the advertisement unless a picture in it was cropped. The picture, from the opening scene of the film in which a woman undergoes an abortion, shows a woman lying on a table with legs bent and a nurse standing beside her. The woman's torso is covered with a sheet, and her bent knees are in the foreground. The newspapers said the picture would have to be cropped to show only the woman's head, said <PERSON> Tamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the group. The group refused, and the ads did not run, she said. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, public relations director at the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We do try to allow the advertiser the widest possible latitude, but we do reserve the right to ask people to make certain adjustments if we feel they need to be made.'' She declined further comment. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, public information supervisor for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> is a `` family newspaper'' and objected to the ad because the photo showed `` a woman with her knees apart and uncovered. We simply asked that they crop the lower portion of the ad.'' She said, `` That kind of request is not at all unusual because we sometimes ask advertisers to modify their ads somewhat. ... It's always a question of context and we review ads one at a time. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority, said the action amounted to censorship and `` reveals a serious double standard for women.'' `` When these papers are selling commercial products _ like movies, underwear or bathing suits, they have no problem showing women's bodies in suggestive positions. Yet, in our ad when a serious public health issue is at stake, we can not show a woman's exposed kneecaps while she is lying on an examination table,'' <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON> said She said the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> told the group it would n't print the ad as the group proposed because it is a family newspaper. However, she said, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> has run in the same section their ad was to run a picture of a woman `` practically naked in a bathing suit.'' Also, the Times printed in Thursday's paper in the same section as the ad was to run `` a photograph of a woman in both erotic and suggestive position'' as part of a movie ad, she said. `` This silly hypocritical standard does n't make sense and it limits everyone's ability to advertise serious subjects,'' she said. The two newspapers were the only two daily papers the group sought to run their ad, <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> said.

 The director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday he opposes legislation being considered by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that would speed the return of wolves to the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON>, newly appointed parks director, called a bill introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Utah </LOCATION>, `` clearly premature.'' Sponsors believe the administration is moving too slowly to restore the only indigenous species still missing from the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area. But the measure has other members growling. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlenee </PERSON>, R-Mont., called the bill `` blatantly anti-sportsman'' because wolves kill elk sought by hunters `` This is a meddlesome bill ... an effort to extend the borders of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>,'' Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, told fellow members of the national parks subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Young called wolf proponents `` romantic'' and said they should see the wolf for what it is, `` without any doubt, second to man in his ability as a predator against the clove-footed animal.'' Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, said livestock owners will kill the wolves in defense of their animals `` and I would support that.'' <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON> said the park service goal is to return the area to its natural state as far as possible. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, of which the park service is a part, is conducting studies to determine: _ If the wolf population can be controlled once it is returned _ The effects of the wolves on prey within the park and big game hunting outside it _ The effect on grizzly bears He said the studies would probably be finished by early in the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, and no environmental impact statement should be prepared before then. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' bill calls for an environmental impact statement and action by the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary after the statement is complete. <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON> said the wording of the bill would make it difficult for the secretary to make any decision other than returning the wolves to the park. <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON> urged the subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, D-Minn., to `` let the scientists do their studies; let the wildlife advocates, ranchers, park visitors, state and local officials, and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> comment on the findings; and then let us make a policy which is driven by our stewardship responsibility. <PERSON> Vento </PERSON> asked, `` Can you give me assurances that there will be no attempt to short circuit'' the process? He said the administration already has delayed planned re-introduction of wolves by two years. <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON> said he was trying to avoid a `` headlong rush'' and said he had an open mind on the subject. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mech </PERSON>, a world-renowned wolf expert with the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, told the subcommittee each wolf eats the equivalent of three adult elk cows a year, which should not endanger the population of about 35,000 elk in the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Mech </PERSON> said the elk that died last year of bad weather would have been the likely prey of wolves. If 10 breeding pairs of wolves were established in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, about 500 could be living there by the turn of the century. He said enough prey, including animals other than elk, exists in the region to support the wolves without disrupting the ecosystem. While admitting that wolves sometimes venture out of the forest to prey on domestic livestock, he said it was unusual.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s report on its investigation into the explosion aboard the battleship <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> is expected to take several more weeks to complete, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sources said Thursday. A board of inquiry has drafted a report into the April 19 incident, which killed 47 sailors. Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the report is in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on the desk of Vice Adm. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnell </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the commander of the Naval Surface Forces. He disputed a report that discord within the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has held it up, and that the service is having difficulty finding senior officers to sign it. `` I would n't describe it as hung up. It's under review,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The spokesman said the report must go up the chain of command for review, and that it will next be seen by the commander in chief of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> fleet, Adm. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, the chief of <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> will see the report before passing it to the Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, who will then refer it to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` The senior officer, and only the senior officer, at each of those eschelons of command in the review process will sign the forwarding endorsement,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The spokesman added that at each point, the signatore has the option of forwarding the report without comment, sending the report back to the investigating officer for additional work, or forwarding it `` as is'' and express his disagreement with some or all of the material. `` I'm not implying that anyone has done any of those things yet,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> source, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said it is expected that each level of command will take about a week to go over the report. `` It wo n't get here before August,'' said the source.

 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, said Thursday he wants a `` cold turkey'' freeze on funds for the stealth bomber, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stepped up his lobbying effort for the radar-evading plane and other defense systems. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needs more information on the costly stealth bomber, as the B-2 plane is known `` The problem this year is ... we do n't really know what we got,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said he wants to give opponents of the plane, at $ 530 million a copy the most expensive aircraft ever produced, a chance to kill the program. But if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't want to do that, it needs more information about the program before moving forward, he added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday called <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> and other members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and Appropriations committees to the White House. He pressed them to back his budget proposals for the B-2, as well as the strategic defense initiative, the MX missile and the Midgetman missile. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are scheduled to vote next week on those programs and a package of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> cuts the administration proposed to meet the $ 10 billion reduction agreed on by <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> negotiators and the White House for the 1990 defense authorization bills. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the group he is fully committed to that package and the weapons systems as essential to the nation's deterrent capability and to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategy at the arms reduction talks ongoing in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, according to Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Given the amount of congressional hesitation, especially regarding the administration's insistence on not cutting the B-2 program, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to re-emphasize his policy reasons for those programs, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to host another meeting Friday to lobby those committee members who could not make the Thursday session. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is emphatic that the plane `` represents the future of bomber aviation,'' and is needed despite its expense, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting that he could not predict which way <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would go on the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending bill next week. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s B-2 plan would not meet with his approval. `` Any delay in the program will only make it more expensive,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` He'd be opposed to such a scenario.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> reiterated the importance of the B-2 bomber in a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans, who are divided on the issue. Supporters of the plane were cheered when it made its first test flight Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> hopes to buy 132 planes at a cost of about $ 70 billion. In fiscal 1990, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has proposed spending $ 4.7 billion for the B-2, but last month the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> armed services panel cut $ 800 million from the budget. Money for the plane is expected to be the most controversial item next week when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consider the Pentagon budget bill. Reps. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., have proposed stopping production after the 13 planes now in the pipeline are If their effort fails, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said, he intends to propose funding production of only two bombers in 1990 and 1991, when the administration wants eight bombers. His amendment would meet the full request for research and development work over that period. `` I say, give the opponents of the B-2 an up-or-down vote. If the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is willing to step up to this issue this year, I say let's do it,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. He called his amendment `` a cold turkey fence of the procurement money until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acts again.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said his plan `` shuts down the program, but it gives the administration a chance to come up with another program that's politically more acceptable _ financially. He said he could not predict how his colleagues will vote on the issue because there has never been a public debate on the once-secret program. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> added he wants the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to `` come up with a cheaper program'' by seeking fewer planes. `` I do n't know anybody who thinks they're going to get 132 planes,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said.

 The chief of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military's <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, is retiring, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday. Sources said the outspoken officer was forced out by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> has been critical of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration policy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and has clashed in the past with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> over policy in the region. In a speech earlier this year to a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> group, the general criticized what he called an `` absence'' of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> has served as the commander in chief of the Panama-based <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces since June 1987. He will retire after 34 years of service on Oct. 1, and will be replaced by Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who released a letter from <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> praising <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> for his `` dedicated service,'' denied that the change in command had anything to do with the political situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. One <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source familiar with the situation said <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> was forced into retirement. `` He was canned,'' said the official, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name. Another government official made a similar comment, saying <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> was being forced out because of unhappiness with his outspokenness. Over the past months, <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>'s troops have been the object of harassment and intimidation at the hands of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Defense Forces. This follows a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign begun under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to oust <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has remained in power despite the administration's attempt to remove him following an indictment on drug trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, who had put in for retirement himself, was asked to stay on and accept the command. The spokesman said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has known <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, who is presently assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, for years and `` has great confidence'' in him.

<TEXT>
 Solidarity legislators argued Thursday over their role in electing <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> president and debated whether to join the new government. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> was elected to the powerful presidency Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> with 270 out of 537 votes. Solidarity's unofficial figures showed that one legislator who is a member of the independent union movement voted for <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, who tried to crush Solidarity when he imposed martial law in 1981. Union spokesmen identified the lawmaker as Sen. <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernatowicz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Suwalki </LOCATION>. Eighteen more members of the Solidarity caucus helped <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> by not voting or by casting invalid ballots, thereby lowering the number of votes required for election, union figures showed. To win, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> needed 50 percent of the valid votes plus one. Solidarity also said 11 of the 300 Communist coalition lawmakers voted against <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and 16 abstained. One Communist, <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Czerwinski </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Debica </ORGANIZATION>, said before the vote that he could not support <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. Militants complained during a seven-hour meeting of Solidarity lawmakers that they could easily have blocked <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s election Deputy <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzuzy </PERSON> of <PERSON> Belchatow </PERSON> said he was quitting the caucus to protest, but later retracted the decision. `` I do n't think we should have given <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> something for free. We should have gotten something in exchange for him being elected president,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bielicki </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Wielowieyski </PERSON> of <PERSON> Katowice </PERSON> defended the votes that helped <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. `` Solidarity has decided not to prolong the -LRB- leadership -RRB- crisis,'' said the senior opposition senator. He said he cast an invalid ballot. Those ballots seemed to be cast mainly by senior opposition negotiators who did not want to endanger the political bargain reached with Communists during talks in April. At the time, it was tacitly accepted that <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> would be president. Deputy <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, a veteran activist who voted against <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, said lawmakers who followed their consciences should be respected no matter how they voted. <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said he favored electing <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> for the sake of political stability, but felt pressure from followers to vote against the man who tried to destroy Solidarity. Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, the lower house of the parliament, was tentatively set for July 27. The session would give <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> his first opportunity to nominate a prime minister, who would form the government subject to legislative approval. Communist authorities since June have urged Solidarity to join them in a coalition government. <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> told state TV after the legislators' meeting that the majority still believe the opposition should not join the government. He added, however, that `` no decisions have been made and the debate will be continued at the next meeting.''

 <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, who was placed under house arrest by Burmese military authorities Thursday, appeared on the political stage less than a year ago to become <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s leading voice for democracy. The daughter of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s assassinated independence hero, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, she returned to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s capital, from her home in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in April 1988 to care for her ailing mother. She found herself in the midst of an unprecedented nationwide campaign to end authoritarianism. She sided with student protesters and stayed with them after the September military coup in which troops of Army Commander Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> crushed dissent by killing hundreds of people. Her campaign rallies commonly draw thousands of people, and Western diplomats say authorities are concerned she could win a general election scheduled for early next year. The slight frame of Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, 44, belies a steely political will that brushes off military intimidation and veiled threats against her life. She had no political experience before last year. Many Burmese attribute her widespread support to her unprecedented denunciation of the military and strongman <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, whom she charges is still pulling the strings although he officially retired last year after 26 years of autocratic rule. Her first appearance on the Burmese political scene was on Aug. 15 last year, when she attempted to mediate between the protesting students and the army by writing an open letter to then President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. But when she spoke outside <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s glittering Shwedagon Pagoda on Aug. 26, the height of the pro-democracy movement, she drew what may have been the largest crowd ever seen in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. An estimated 1 million people packed the streets to hear her call for democracy and an end to one-party rule. Demonstrators camped in the streets for days to see her. After brutal clampdowns on dissent that killed thousands, the army crushed open street protest after Sept 18. Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> subsequenty emerged as the most prominent of the Burmese opposition leaders. Her popularity has increased steadily and she has drawn large crowds during political campaign tours throughout the country this year. In December, crowds filled the streets of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> for the funeral of her mother, <PERSON> Kyin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first female ambassador. Her party, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, is the largest political opposition group and claims over 700,000 members in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> alone. Over the past month she has openly defied martial law regulations, which forbid open air political rallies and gatherings of more than five persons. Her speeches in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> have drawn crowds of up to 15,000 despite the persistent presence of armed troops. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in 1945 and married British academic <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Aris </PERSON> in 1972. Her two sons traveled recently to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. She went to school in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> where her mother was <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first female ambassador. She won a scholarship to <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> in 1967 and obtained an honors degree in politics, philosophy and economics. She later worked at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and in the early 1980s researched the life of her father and the origins of <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> nationalism at <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. She has written two books, a guide to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> for children and a short biography of her father.

 A creek swelled by a surprise storm rose 13 feet in a half-hour Thursday, washing about 10 vehicles off a bridge and killing a pregnant woman, authorities said. Divers battled the raging current of <LOCATION> Goose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> to search for up to three people seen floating by in a car, but three others were rescued from the creek, said Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Flohr </PERSON> of the Fauquier County Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Eight other people managed to escape the fast-moving water on their own after their vehicles were swept away, said <PERSON> Flohr </PERSON>. More than 100 military personnel and rescue workers searched for the three people seen in the floating car, <PERSON> Flohr </PERSON> said. But rain started to fall again and the search was suspended after 5 p.m., said Sgt. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> of the sheriff's department. The search was concentrated along a one-mile area downstream of the bridge on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 17. Water from the creek covered the bridge and carried the vehicles off shortly after midnight. <PERSON> Flohr </PERSON> identified the dead woman as <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Conneway </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bloommerry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who was alone in a pickup truck that was washed into the creek Her age was not immediately available. The creek, which normally runs about 10 feet below the bridge, rose an estimated 13 feet within a half-hour, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, director of county emergency services. He said many drivers tried to cross the bridge despite the high water. `` It's the age-old story: people forget about the tremendous force of running water,'' he said. The storm caught everyone by surprise, said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` We had no warning whatsoever. There was nothing from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Up to 3.8 inches of rain fell in nearby <LOCATION> Linden </LOCATION> Wednesday night, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said the creek receded as quickly as it rose.

 A feud between Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> became public Thursday, and newspapers said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> might fire the hard-line former defense minister from the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, now trade minister, has been challenging <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s leadership of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc He renewed attacks Thursday on the prime minister's peace plan, demanding the Cabinet focus on crushing the 19-month-old Palestinian rebellion instead of debating the language of peace proposals. The former general said on army radio: `` No personal attacks or threats to fire me will keep me from demanding an end to the murder of Jews in the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Arab reporters said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers fatally shot <PERSON> Tarik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Imram </PERSON>, 17, in the neck during a confrontation in <LOCATION> Burin </LOCATION> village near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. They said a 20-year-old Palestinian was wounded in the leg. In its confirmation, the army said one young man was killed and another wounded during a search-and-arrest operation. Twenty Palestinians were wounded in confrontations with stone-throwing protesters in half a dozen other towns and refugee camps in the occupied lands, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. At least 572 Palestinians have been killed since the rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987, in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 war. Thirty-seven Israelis have been slain. Palestinians stayed home from work Thursday and closed their shops as part of a general strike to express rejection of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal for elections in the territories for <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegates to talk peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> About 250 Palestinian lawyers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> began a month-long boycott of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military courts to protest what they describe as the army's failure to notify family members and lawyers promptly about arrests. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauschnow </PERSON> acknowledged in a recent interview there had been some delays, which he attributed the bureaucracy, but said the army had doubled its legal staff to clear up a case backlog and end confusion. In the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> military court, the trial of three Arab shepherds on charges of killing <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>, a U.S.-born Israeli, a month ago opened began without their lawyer. Jews stoned Arab-owned cars in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and three <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> motorists were injured, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. It said one was hospitalized. Police detained Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION>, a Jewish settlement near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, on suspicion of damaging Arab houses in <LOCATION> Halhoul </LOCATION> three weeks ago, the radio said. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, confirmed the prime minister had received a letter from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> condemning the building of Jewish settlements in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, where 70,000 settlers live among 1.7 million Palestinians. He described the letter as `` friendly, most positive,'' however, and said it expressed support for the peace initiative. <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> would not comment on reports in two major newspapers, the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> and the independent <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>, that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was considering dismissing <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s anger erupted in a closed meeting Wednesday of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> ministers, where <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> criticized the premier for not disclosing details of his talks with Palestinians about election arrangements. Newspapers quoted this exchange: `` I can not tell you anything; you leak everything you get your hands on,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> responded, and accused <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> of `` sowing bad blood and hatred among us.'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said, `` I can only laugh at your words. I have contempt for what you say,'' and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> replied: `` He who laughs last laughs best, and I do n't want to speak to you.'' Several newspapers interpreted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s words as a threat to fire <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said the prime minister's allies in <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> were urging him to do so. <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> suggested, however, that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> wanted to avoid a split. `` The prime minister is concerned about the unity of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>,'' the spokesman said. `` He has a high tolerance threshold and tries to see things in their broadest sense.'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, who won fame as an anti-guerrilla fighter and the general who saved <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from defeat in the 1973 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, favors tougher measures against the Palestinian uprising. His popularity has grown because of such events as the July 6 bus crash, when a Palestinian forced an Israeli bus off a highway into a ravine, killing 16 Jews and injuring 25 others. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s most convincing show of power came at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s governing committee July 5, when he succeeded in getting harsh conditions attached to the peace plan. The conditions demand that the uprising end before elections are held, provide for continued buiding of settlements, prohibit residents of Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> from voting in the elections and reject Palestinian statehood. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s acceptance of the conditions prompted a threat from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to leave the coalition government and force early elections. Labor's governing committee is scheduled to meet on the issue Aug. 9.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>' friends and neighbors said Thursday that the hero label fits the slim pilot who was named the state's Little League Volunteer of the Year days before he left on Flight 232. The DC-10 <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> was flying crashed Wednesday in an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> cornfield. Some survivors and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> credited the pilot with bringing the crippled plane down from six miles up and saving their lives. `` Just knowing him and the way he is, I would have wanted him to be the man behind the controls,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, who has worked closely with <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> in Little League for nine years. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> planned to umpire the district league championships on Sunday but it rained, so he promised to be back on Thursday to call the rescheduled games. Instead, <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> and his Seattle-based flight crew are hospitalized in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where the Denver-to-Chicago flight came down. Friends said <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> had a passion for flying since his days as a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> fighter pilot during the Korean War. He also has a love for baseball and children, and volunteered the equivalent of over two months of his time a year to the Little League, <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said. He trained and evaluated umpires, oversaw games, and was umpire at the league's 1978 world series in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Penn. </LOCATION>, and at the senior world series, for ages 13-15 between 1981-84 in <LOCATION> Kissimmee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` He has a very warm feeling for children. That's why he does what he does,'' <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said. `` He's always willing to help. ... He's a well-traveled umpire and one of the best.'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>' Little League activities earned him the 1989 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state Little League Volunteer of the Year award, which was announced June 27. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, first officer <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, and second officer Officer D.J. <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON> were trapped under debris in the DC-10's cockpit and were removed after a forklift raised the wreckage, said Dr. <PERSON> Romaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendixen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, clinic commander of the 185th Tactical Fighter Group. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> `` had lacerations behind both ears, lacerations of the foot and face,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Budensiek </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` He was a very lucky man.'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and moved to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in 1964, eight years after he was hired by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Records joined <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> in 1969 and <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON> in 1986. Flight attendants who worked with <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> described him as `` one of the most respected pilots'' at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and `` a competent and concerned flyer.'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> `` was in good shape and he was a good pilot,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Desy </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> mechanic who has lived next door to <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON>, and their three children in south <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> for more than 20 years. `` He did a hell of a job'' handling the plane, <PERSON> Desy </PERSON> said. Records was a pilot for at least 20 years and came to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> when <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> routes. He flew the Seattle-to-San Fransisco route for a year before switching to the <LOCATION> Chicago-to-Seattle </LOCATION> route two years ago.

 About 1,000 Greek Cypriot women declared victory Thursday and left a stretch of the island's ethnic dividing line after two days of protesting the 15-year-old Turkish occupation of northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The protest had threatened to wreck 11 months of U.N.-sponsored negotiations on reuniting the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island. `` We have achieved our purpose of emphasizing the Greek Cypriots' right of return'' to their homes in the north, said <PERSON> Athena </PERSON> <PERSON> Violari </PERSON>, one of the organizers. `` This is not the right place to continue our action for the release of those detained.'' On Wednesday night, <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> riot police backed by Turkish soldiers entered St. <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s church in the buffer zone Wednesday night and arrested 100 women and 11 men, including Greek Orthodox Bishop <PERSON> Chrysostomos </PERSON> of Kition. At midnight Thursday, the demonstrators walked backward out of a narrow alley that marks the line between the Greek and Turkish communities, singing the Greek national anthem. They said they would march on Friday to the home of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special representative <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Camilion </PERSON> and seek his help in freeing the detainees. Many residents of northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> fled when <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded on July 20, 1974, after a short-lived coup against the late President <PERSON> Makarios </PERSON>. The protesters entered the buffer zone by breaking through <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> checkpoints. After the violence at the church, they withdrew to the nearby alley and held an all-night vigil, singing hymns and Greek songs and shouting anti-Turkish slogans. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency said 108 protesters appeared in court in the Turkish sector Thursday and were ordered jailed for two days pending trial proceedings. It was not known what charges they face. The agency said three foreign reporters seized by riot police had been released. They were <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>, both of the British <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency, and Dutch radio reporter <PERSON> Hetty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubberding </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> said she and <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON> were injured during Wednesday's clash `` I was n't treated well ... I was kicked and beaten,'' Ms. <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>, a dual Cypriot-American national, said after her release. After he was freed, <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON> was treated for a bayonet wound in the leg, Ms. <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> said. In a speech marking the anniversary of the Turkish invasion, President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> leader, pledged support for the protesters `` who were attacked brutally while they were praying without provoking anyone.'' `` We demand the immediate release of those arrested and the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the buffer zone,'' he told several thousand Greek Cypriots in central Eleftheria Square. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said all refugees must be allowed to go home and the island must be reunified. He earlier protested to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> over the Turkish move into the buffer zone. The women's protest was part of a series of anniversary demonstrations to protest the Turkish invasion of the island's northern third Turkish troops moved in after an Athens-inspired coup by supporters of union with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The Turks said they came to protect the 120,000-member Turkish Cypriot minority, which forms 17 percent of the island's population. The mounting tension threatened reunification talks between <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>, leader of the Turkish Cypriots. The official Turkish Cypriot Radio <PERSON> Bayrak </PERSON> said that sector's government would meet later Thursday to decide if <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> should attend the next round of talks set for July 26 Turkish Cypriots attended rallies and held a military parade Thursday to celebrate the anniversary of the Turkish invasion.

<TEXT>
 The Iran-Contra criminal case against a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief is imperiled because of the danger of disclosing certain government secrets, sources familiar with the matter said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is considering intervening in the case of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, about to be put on trial by a special prosecutor, said government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. Asked about the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said, `` There are various options that are being debated.'' Asked if the options include a move by the department that would scuttle the case, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said, `` That's not a decision that we would ever make.'' `` There are very serious matters being discussed with respect to the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case and the discussions are ongoing,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Belcher </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the office of the special prosecutor, independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. The difficulties revolve around the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s fears that too much information about the agency's activities that is now classified is being sought for public use in <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>' trial. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> station chief who secretly assisted former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Contra resupply network in 1985 and 1986, is accused of two counts of obstruction and two counts of making false statements to Iran-Contra investigators. `` The government was notified ... of a new emphasis in the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s position regarding certain classified information which may substantially complicate the trial,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office said in a court filing earlier this week which provided the first indication that the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case might be in trouble In that filing, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> suggested that instead of the trial starting Monday as scheduled, a hearing be held that day on matters concerning classified information. On hursday, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said he did not know whether exercising any of the options the department has would put <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> in the position of having to seek dismissal of the charges against <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. If classified information is too sensitive to declassify but is needed for a criminal trial, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> may move that a summary of the secret information be presented in court instead. If the court denies the motijon, the attorney general may file an affidavit objecting to disclosure of the classified information. The court must then order that the information not be disclosed, a step which can lead to dismissal of the criminal case. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was questioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office in 1987, which led to charges against him. The indictment says that he falsely told the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office that a secret airstrip construction project that was to be part of the Contra supply network was initiated by the Costa Rican government. In congressional tetsimony which can not be used against him at his trial, <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> admitted that <PERSON> North </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government initiated the project. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> falsely told the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that he did not know for a fact that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was assisting the Contra resupply operation, according to the indictment. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> is accused in a bill of particulars filed by prosecutors of making 19 additional statements that were so misleading that they obstructed the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general office's inquiries into the Iran-Contra scandal.

 The congressman who introduced <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing on <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' nomination to be the government's chief civil rights enforcer abruptly took back his support Thursday and the chairman of the committee in charge said he might vote against <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., returning to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing room where he had strongly urged <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' confirmation a day earlier, said, `` It is with a slightly heavy heart I come to withdraw my endorsement of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said he made the decision after being `` frankly astounded'' when <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> told the panel that a series of recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions on civil rights did not undermine enforcement of anti-discrimination laws. `` We are in a crisis in the civil rights movement,'' said <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, who, like <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, is black. `` If you ca n't figure out these cases are seriously cutting back very modest progress that we made, then there is no point waiting for you to become the assistant attorney general of the civil rights division for me to argue it with you then,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said. He stopped short of urging the panel to reject the nomination, suggesting the committee should give <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> the benefit of the doubt and perhaps a chance for on-the-job training. The committee chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., said at the hearing, `` I was inclined to vote for him until yesterday. But now, `` I'm inclined to vote against him.'' `` My doubt about this man does n't relate to his lack of experience,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. He expressed concern about `` whether you're going to have somebody as assistant attorney general for civil rights who is going to fight for civil rights.'' He testimony from <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> on Wednesday failed to satisfy him. `` When I asked him whether we were moving in the right direction or the wrong way on civil rights he did n't have an opinion,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> had predicted that `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> will go on to greatness'' as assistant attorney general for civil rights. `` If he does n't,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> added, `` I will be the first one calling for his head on a pike.'' Reacting to <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>' withdrawal of support, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., who has been serving as chairman of the hearings, said that `` it obviously hurts the <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> candidacy _ how much, I ca n't quantify `` In all my 15 years on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, I've never seen anything like it,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. He said the vote on the committee `` is close.'' `` It may hurt him some,'' Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said of <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>' new stand. `` But I hope that it wo n't mean much.'' `` He did say that he believed that the nominee is committed to civil rights,'' <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> said. Civil rights groups contend that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, 61, a Republican who served as sheriff and later chief executive of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, lacks professional qualifications for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> job. Such criticism has been echoed by some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> has never tried a court case and has practiced law only since he left public office in 1986. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>' spirited speech in support of the <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> nomination was repeatedly commended to the attention of reporters Wednesday by supporters while <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was being grilled by senators about questions relating to his honesty and character. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> had agreed to introduce <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> after the state's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, broke with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> custom and declined to accompany <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to the committee hearing The senators said they were withholding judgment on the nomination. In his testimony Thursday, <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said he was disturbed to learn that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> had told the committee that `` he could live with these cases.'' `` I can not live with these cases,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said of the recent high court decisions that civil rights lawyers say will make it harder to win discrimination suits in court. `` We've got some problems,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said. `` We're not going to wait to get them cleared up. They are going to get cleared up with me and <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> today or they are not going to get cleared up at all.'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, adhering closely to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's policy, said on Wednesday that he did not regard the decisions as hurting civil rights enforcement. He promised, like Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had already done, to closely monitor the impact of the decisions on court cases to determine if legislation is needed to overturn the rulings. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> Thursday morning to say that he thought <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' position on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions `` was diametrically opposed to his own,'' said <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' testimony had `` put him in a very difficult position,'' <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, who is supporting legislation being drafted in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the effect of several high court rulings. <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> had discussed the nominee's views on civil rights over the past two or three months. `` Mr. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> was led to believe the positions were very much closer than that,'' <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, a spokesman for Attorney General <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, discounted the significance of <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>' withdrawal of support, saying, `` I still expect Mr. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to be confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' Of <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>' criticism, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said, `` It is unrealistic for anybody to expect the nominee of the president for this position would go before a congressional committee and disown a position taken by the president and by the attorney general.''

 <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> Thursday accused <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> of deporting 26,000 of its black nationals following racial violence that left between 250 and 400 dead in the two countries. `` It is to be feared that not a single black Mauritanian will be unaffected by the measures,'' <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>'s acting foreign minister said in letter to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> security council. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharass </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission said, `` There is no such policy in my country.'' Tensions between the black Senegalese and the fairer-skinned, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and Berber Mauritanians have long historical and racial roots, but a confrontation in April and May began as a minor border incident. Tens of thousands of Mauritanians and Senegalese were repatriated in a U.N.-sponsored airlift. To reduce tensions, both nations sent home workers from the other country after the violent clashes, which left between 250 and 400 people dead, <PERSON> Kharass </PERSON> said. He denied <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> was expelling any of its own citizens. But Medoune Fall, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>'s acting foreign minister, said, `` Beginning in mid-May, the Mauritanian government took steps to expel its black nationals belonging to ethnic groups also found in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>. `` In just a few weeks, the operation has affected 26,000 individuals, who have been driven from their own country solely by reason of their ethnic origin,'' Fall said. Those deported to <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> were arriving completely stripped of property, he said. Between July 16 and 18 alone, 2,000 blacks were deported, <PERSON> Fall </PERSON> said. Fall said the deportations would increase tensions between the two countries. <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> was the last nation in the world to officially abolish slavery, in 1980. Most slaves were black, while the traders and owners were usually Arabs or Berbers. Hard economic times have worsened ethnic tensions between the two nations as hundreds of thousands of people have crossed the border seeking work in the other country. <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> estimates that up to 50,000 Senegalese, mainly seasonal workers, lived in <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> before the latest clashes broke out. About 500,000 Mauritanians, most of them tradesmen, live in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Senate Committee Deadlocked On Drought Relief</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> failed to reach agreement Thursday on a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> plan to provide $ 1 billion in relief for farmers who are losing crops to this summer's drought and flooding. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., postponed a vote on the package until next week after <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators argued the measure covers too many crops and costs too much <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said he did not want to risk a vote on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor without bipartisan support. `` Drought and disaster is n't a partisan issue and relief should n't be either,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has threatened to veto a drought-relief bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last month that is estimated to cost $ 1.3 billion and cover more than 500 crops, from corn to cherries. Senate Democrats, agreeing the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure is too expensive, proposed to scale it back by $ 300 million by reducing the payments to farmers and tightening qualifications for the program. The administration wants to limit the bill to $ 870 million, but Democrats say the government can afford an additional $ 200 million, if some of the payments to farmers come from this year's budget instead of next year's. The deep division within the committee became evident earlier in the day when the panel voted 10-9 along party lines to kill an $ 800 million <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> proposal that would have targeted a greater share of the drought assistance to crops that are in the government's price support program _ wheat, corn, rice and cotton. `` Where money is limited we must set priorities,'' said <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, the committee's ranking Republican. Sen. <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Republican whose state's rice and cotton crops have been devastated by flooding, said the Democratic plan would spread the aid so thin `` there's going to be precious little benefit to anybody.'' Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, where the winter wheat crop was cut back sharply by drought, said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plan would mean an extra 15 cents a bushel for wheat and an additional 21 cents a bushel for corn. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> argues that winter-wheat farmers should get first crack at drought relief since much of the savings in the farm program that is being used to pay for drought relief is the result of a smaller wheat crop. `` Where does the money come from? It comes from program crops,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` If we're going to cover non-program crops, we should find the money elsewhere.'' The Republican plan would have provided relief to wheat, corn, rice and cotton on the same basis as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill and the 1988 drought legislation; other crops could have received assistance if the money was available in the federal budget. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> acknowledged for the first time today that losses have occurred in at least one other crop _ namely spring wheat in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, where drought-related crop losses already are estimated at $ 660 million. Sen. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, who is concerned about getting relief for sunflowers and other non-program crops in his state, said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal was modest and more fair. `` Nobody's going to get a windfall out of this,'' he said. `` An act of God,'' said Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., `` does n't distinguish between program and non-program crops

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, going against heavy pressure from gun owners' organizations, Thursday narrowly approved a three-year ban on sales of nine military-style assault weapons. `` It's designed to deny drug dealers the use of these types of weapons,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., following 7-6 approval at a hectic session ending with a gun lobbyist complaining about a senator's decision not to vote The measure would ban nine varieties of semiautomatic assault weapons, five already covered by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's import ban and four others produced domestically. The bill also would provide for up to 10 years of additional prison time for those convicted of crimes involving firearms. The measure would automatically go off the books in three years under a `` sunset'' provision. Critics of the measure called it too restrictive, although it was modest in comparison with a flurry of bills that went into the hopper in February following a mass slaying in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> schoolyard with a semi-automatic assault rifle. `` I think it does a great deal of damage to the right of the people to keep and bear arms,'' Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, told the committee. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the bill headed in the right direction but should be stronger in banning assault weapons. `` Frankly it is a letdown to the law enforcement groups in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said. At the start of the meeting, Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., told the committee he would not be able to attend because he was tied down with evidence hearings in the impeachment trial of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, accused of plotting to obtain a $ 150,000 bribe He then left. When it came time to vote an hour later, however, there was a question as to whether the committee should wait for Specter. The Hastings hearing was taking place in a room about a three-minute walk away. `` The problem is he's on the <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> matter and I know he takes that very, very seriously,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. Because of the razor-thin margin, senators held open the roll call for 10 minutes or more in case <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> might want to vote. A minute after the vote was announced, the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> senator arrived but told <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., he would need time to study any changes made in the legislation <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> banged the gavel and adjourned the meeting. The chairman and <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> were both quickly out the door, but Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, told reporters that `` as a matter of courtesy they could have given him five or six minutes to study the bill.'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON>, however, told reporters he had been with <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> `` at the <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> hearing, in the back of the room,'' urging him to come to the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting to vote against <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>'s bill. `` Basically,'' <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON> said, `` Specter just decided to be absent.'' The lobbyist said he still expected the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> senator to be on the side of gunowner groups when the measure comes to the floor. Earlier, Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, and Republican followers sought to substitute the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's omnibus crime control bill for the gun measure, but that effort failed 8-5. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> warned that strong anticrime measures are needed and cited the case of a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> man convicted of murder a decade ago. `` He has n't been electrocuted yet,'' <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> said. `` People are are losing respect for criminal justice procedures.'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said crime-control measures are needed but not before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> implements broad powers granted him in last year's drug bill He said the administration has been authorized to hire 225 new <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents but has not done so. `` I do n't doubt the president's sincerity,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. `` I just do n't think he's tough enough.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee voted Thursday to spend $ 225 million to begin construction of the `` super collider'' particle accelerator. The chairman called the collider project the most important scientific effort in the nation. But the chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., said an amendment may be introduced in the full <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that would hold up the $ 4.4 billion project until foreign governments agree to participate <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s energy and water development subcommittee and also of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he would oppose such a condition. `` There's sentiment in our committee to adopt report language which will, in effect, say do n't give away the great technological contracts to the Japanese or to any other participant,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. Committee reports are not binding, but the reports are very influential in guiding administration decisions. Explaining his support of the collider, planned for a site 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said, `` It unlocks the secret of what we're made of, what the universe is made of, what energy and matter and all of the basic stuff of the universe is made of and it's exciting.'' He said he has `` limited enthusiasm'' for enlisting other countries to share the cost: `` I think this research is so important we ought to do it in this country if we can and not farm it out to have somebody else build the most important technological parts of it.'' While President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had sought $ 250 million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said budget constraints forced him to settle on $ 225 million. The House has voted $ 200 million, and if the project survives, the two Houses will have to agree on an amount.

The guilt, there are different stages,'' <PERSON> Narvaez </PERSON> said. `` Sometimes the feelings wo n't come out until they see friends or relatives or get to their destination.''

When asked who organized the meeting, the answer _ over and over again _ was, `` No one and everyone.'' `` Everything is consensus,'' said <PERSON> Yng </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, a musician who works at the Bound Together anarchist bookstore in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Haight-Ashbury </LOCATION> neighborhood Anarchists generally believe that every form of regulation or government is immoral and restraint of one person by another is evil. Despite that tenet, the `` mainstream media'' were banned by the anarchists, who discussed the issue during a general assembly before the convention got under way. `` We decided you guys just are n't going to give us a fair shake, so we're not going to let any of you in,'' said one young woman, who appeared to be guarding the entrance to the auditorium where the conference was held. She and a companion refused to identify themselves and were unswayed by arguments that a selective-media policy contradicts the principles of anarchy. Other contradictions to a classical definition of anarchy were admitted without embarrassment. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Somers </PERSON>, a clarinet player in a symphony, brought a 10-year-old boy to the event. `` We're definitely against a lot of authoritarian trips,'' said <PERSON> Somers </PERSON>, adding as he pointed at the child, `` He does n't go to school ... And no sugar.'' As for the sugar mandate, <PERSON> Somers </PERSON> added he `` would n't impose authority on anyone _ except for kids.'' For those not steeped in this particular brand of anarchy, there was a `` Anarchy 101'' workshop, one of 16 seminars on Thursday. A written guide described it this way, with anarchist punctuation: `` just what is this anarchy stuff anyway? are you the guys with black pointy hats who shoot people and blow things up? if we had anarchy who would pick up the garbage?'' A workshop on the animal liberation movement read: `` woof. woof. woof. baaaaa. neigh chirp. chirp. squeek squeek. meow. mooo. discussions on veganism, vivisection, fur and leather, ecological connections and more.'' Among seminars on spirituality was `` Slaying Christ,'' which discussed methods of ridding the world of so-called patriarchal religions. Anarchist ideals were summed up by a poem posted on the wall by activist <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>: `` Take what you need, Give what you can, When you can, However you can, In other words, Lend a hand.''

 A twin-engine plane caught fire shortly after takeoff Wednesday and slammed into a house near an airport as the pilot attempted an emergency landing, killing the man and a 6-month-old baby inside the home. The baby's parents and their other four children escaped from the house with minor injuries, a hospital spokeswoman said. The Beechcraft 18 cargo plane appeared to be trying to turn back to <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> when it plowed into the house, said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The home in this <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> suburb was reduced to blackened rubble, and flames destroyed all evidence aboard the plane, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. However, he said the plane's 2,100-pound load was at least 500 pounds under the federal limit, and weather did not appear to be a factor. The plane crashed into the home of <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 33, and his wife, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON>, 31, about a mile from the airport around 7:20 a.m., <LOCATION> Anne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arundel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fire officials said. The body of the baby, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>, was found in the rubble about three hours later. As the house burned, `` people were standing around because they could n't get in to help,'' said a neighbor, who identified herself only as <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON>. `` I saw the mother and father come out of the side of the house by the kitchen, and she laid ... screaming, ` My babies! My babies!''' Another neighbor, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Majerowicz </PERSON>, 28, said neighbors had to restrain Beam from returning to the blazing house in what would have been a dangerous and probably vain effort rescue the baby. <ORGANIZATION> Centre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> operations director <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbrick </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Reedsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, company owned the aircraft, identified the pilot as <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitalini </PERSON>, 50, of <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, N.Y. The airplane left the airport at 7:15 a.m. on a routine run carrying packages for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Winchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Two minutes later, <PERSON> Vitalini </PERSON> radioed that the plane was on fire and that he was returning to the airport, but he crashed moments later, <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON> said. The pilot was alone. Thick, white smoke still poured from the ruins of the house more than two hours after the crash. Neighbors wept as they watched firefighters cut through the debris and pull chunks of the plane from the rubble. Charred toys and clothing littered the yard. The Beams and their other three children were treated at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arundel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and released, said a supervisor who gave her name only as Mrs. <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON>. Witness <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Farney </PERSON> said he saw flames shooting from the cockpit moments before the crash, but authorities said they could n't confirm that. No flight recorder was recovered, and the 34-year-old aircraft was not required to carry one, investigators said. There are `` garbled'' control tower tape recordings, but investigators said they had not listened to them yet, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. Neighbors who feared such an accident have been fighting airport officials for years to change flight paths away from the heavily populated area. `` In this area the planes come by so close they rattle the dishes, and you can wave to the people in the planes,'' said neighbor <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>.

<BYLINE>Effigy Doused When No Flag Ignited ^By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 A group of Republicans congressman on Thursday drenched an effigy of a flag-burner with water as a Medal of Honor winner and a former POW were urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to resist amending the constitution to ban flag burning. When rumors of an impending flag burning swept the Capitol, more than a dozen <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers armed with fire extinguishers and a bucket of water marched to the scene. Two fire trucks were already waiting, as were the television cameras. The flag burning never happened, and the lawmakers were forced to make do with throwing their water at a stuffed-clothing dummy on the steps of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON>, R-Calif., said the congressman were setting an example for Americans who witness flag burnings `` If they do n't have a bucket of water, I hope they take care of business however they can,'' he told the crowd of colleagues and others protesting the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision that allows flag burning as a form of political expression. `` You're not going to come to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and burn the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> flag,'' warned Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Miss. The object of Thursday's scorn was <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, whose conviction for burning of the American flag at the 1984 Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> led to the court's 5-4 decision. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> held a news conference in a building across the street to protest <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' decision not to invite him to testify. He said he never intended to burn a flag on Thursday. `` I'm not going to, like fall into this silly trap,'' he said. Major veterans groups, meanwhile, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutional law subcommittee that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should take action to ban flag burnings. Two of the groups _ the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> and the Veterans of Foreign Wars _ said a constitutional amendment was the only course of action. The Disabled American Veterans said it could also support support a new statute, if one could be drawn that would pass the court's muster. Subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., has said his panel hopes to produce a statute for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' August <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and others who fear a constitutional amendment would weaken the Bill of Rights are hoping a statute will calm the political uproar. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> flight officer who was shot down and spent 5 -LCB- years in a North Vietnamese prison camp, testified that a constitutional amendment would put American freedoms at risk. `` If this amendment be issued by this <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and ratified by this nation, there will come a deluge against the Bill of Rights,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, an attorney. `` Our Bill of Rights has served as a legal restraint upon our government for 200 years,'' he said. `` If these restraints be removed, we shall not survive as a free nation.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who won the Medal of Honor in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> battle, recalled how he would think of the flags given `` to relatives of brothers in arms of mine -LRB- as -RRB- a last token of gratitude for the ultimate sacrifice.'' But he said that men do not `` serve this country for the flag alone.'' He said an amendment to the constitution might spark a competition among politicians for who could put the toughest penalty for flag burning. `` Each of us that has worn the uniform of this country are fully aware that the Pledge of Allegiance ends in the words, ` And Justice for All,''' he said. On a recent visit to the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said he saw the flag reflected on the granite face etched with the names of the dead. `` They were as much a part of the flag as the cloth and stitching,'' he said.

 Twelve models of `` Doll Craftin'' may present a choking hazard to young children and are being voluntarily recalled by the <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> manufacturer, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The Cupie Dolls, sold as home craft products since June 1982, are being recalled by <PERSON> Mangelsen </PERSON>'s of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>.

The dolls, made in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, were sold in clear plastic bags with cardboard headers. Sold under the label, `` Doll Craftin,'' the recalled models are: Cupie Doll models 155-67, 156-07, 156-09 and 156-13; Sitting Honey Doll model 156-63; `` <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> Doll'' with Top Knot model 157-96; Honey Bun Doll models 158-43, 158-45, 158-46; Curly-One Doll models 158-69, 158-70; Sitting Curly-One Doll models 158-71 through 158-76; Honey Dear Dolls models 158-77 through 158-82; and two unnamed dolls, models 156-61 and 157-97.

 <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and a union representing more than 2,000 broadcast employees tentatively agreed Thursday to a new four-year contract after the union offered to compromise on job security issues. The compromise became possible when the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technicians </ORGANIZATION> `` suggested to the company that the company's four-year job guarantee to <ORGANIZATION> NABET </ORGANIZATION> was less significant to the union than the issue of ... seniority,'' the company said in a letter to its employees. The company had offered to make the job guarantee four years instead of three, but it came with so many escape clauses that it was `` like a Swiss cheese full of holes,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NABET </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON>. The company withdrew the job-guarantee proposal and substituted the seniority list compromise. The new rules call for employees on local and network television seniority lists who were hired before Thursday to have a higher priority than those hired after Thursday, who will be put on a new, separate seniority list. That new list will be the basis of last hired, first fired terminations should layoffs occur. A separate seniority list for radio employees will be maintained as the company originally proposed. The union's members, 2,700 according to the union, 2,150 according to the company, will vote on the agreement Aug. 11. <ORGANIZATION> NABET </ORGANIZATION> also represents publicists, wardrobe people and newswriters in certain cities, among other workers.

 Tropical Storm <PERSON> Dalilia </PERSON> skirted the <LOCATION> Hawaiian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> on Thursday, causing some road flooding, high surf and a power outage but no major property damage or injuries. <PERSON> Dalilia </PERSON> passed about 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, southernmost in the chain, Wednesday night after weakening from a hurricane to a tropical storm. A flash flood watch was in effect for all islands as the weakening storm moved northwest on a course parallel to the state. At 8 a.m. HST Thursday, the storm was about 120 miles south of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, moving northwest at 17 mph. Its maximum sustained wind speed was 58 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that speed reaches 74 mph. <PERSON> Dalilia </PERSON> was forecast to pass 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, on the island of <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>, causing heavy rain, high surf and stiff wind, but forecasters said the progressive weakening of the storm made it less of a threat than it was to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Nevertheless, the <ORGANIZATION> Oahu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> advised <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> residents to purchase emergency supplies such as flashlights, batteries and canned food in case the storm takes a sudden turn north, spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Takamiya </PERSON> said. `` Because it seems to staying on a course that will bring it parallel to the islands, we think the main problem might be from the rain, hopefully the winds wo n't be too extreme, but we might get some flooding'' said <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosendal </PERSON>, the weather service's lead forecaster. `` We got away pretty clean in regard to rain, wind and surf,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> administrator. Up to 8 inches of water closed the only highway along <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s south coast, but the road was reopened early Thursday, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said. More than 7 inches of rain fell during a 24-hour period in areas of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s south coast, the weather service said. Winds of 35 to 40 mph knocked out a transformer near <LOCATION> Pahala </LOCATION>, blacking out the community of 3,000. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said electricity there would remain out until late Thursday.

No injuries were reported in any of the incidents The slew of mishaps came one day after the fiery crash of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232. At least 76 people were killed, and up to 43 others were missing and believed dead. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the DC-10 en route from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> made an unscheduled landing at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after at least one bird was sucked into one of the engines. The 265 passengers and 10 crew members on Flight 23 were later transferred to another airplane and continued their flight, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said. `` The airplane was leaving <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, was climbing out after takeoff, when either a bird or several birds were ingested into the No. 1 engine, which is on the left side of the airplane,'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said. `` The engine experienced some vibration and the captain shut the engine down, and then proceeded to ... O'Hare ... where he landed normally and safely.'' Earlier in the day, one of the three engines on the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 developed a compressor problem, and the pilot returned the jet to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Metropolitan Airport, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, spokesman for the <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>, Minn.-based airline. `` We had the emergency equipment standing by as a precaution,'' he said. Flight 492 was carrying 146 passengers from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, who were transferred to another aircraft. In <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 727 made a precautionary return after a faulty cockpit indicator alerted the pilot to engine power failure. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Flight 850, with 137 passengers and six crew members, left <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> about 11 a.m. destined for <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Messing </PERSON>, a spokesman for Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was no loss of power in the engine,'' Messing said. `` The indication turned out to be faulty.''

Because some lawmakers in his ruling Communist coalition voted against <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, a boycott of Wednesday's balloting by a number of Solidarity legislators may have made the difference. The ruling coalition commands a 54 percent majority in the two-chamber parliament, where a simple majority was needed for election, but some hard-line Communists are resisting <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s road of compromise Most if not all Solidarity deputies and senators who participated apparently denied <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> their votes.

 They call Warrant Officer <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON>, formerly of the French Foreign Legion, the `` bomb magician.'' He calls himself a `` bomb charmer.'' Either name fits, for he has defused more than 2,000 terrorist bombs in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war, probably more than any other demolitions specialist. <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON>, who also fought the Germans with Gen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>'s Free French forces in World War II, has survived three assassination attempts by terrorists whose actions he has thwarted, been shot twice and blown up by a mine _ all for the equivalent of $ 200 a month and free gasoline `` If all the bombs he's defused had gone off, the death toll of the civil war would have more than doubled,'' said a police colonel, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Bitar is indispensable.'' More than 150,000 people have been killed in the civil war, hundreds of them in car bombings. When car bombs explode before he can get to them, <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON> can usually tell after examining the blast scene how much explosive was used, sometimes even the type. <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON>, 61, has defused 300 car bombs outside hospitals, airline offices, newspaper buildings, embassies, government ministries, movie theaters, churches and mosques. Most of the others were time bombs planted in jetliners, supermarkets, banks, schools, universities and gasoline stations. <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON> estimates the total explosive weight of the bombs he had defused since 1975 at more than 100 tons, `` enough to blow up <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON> is a Greek Catholic. But he defies <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian-Moslem </ORGANIZATION> sectarian barriers and regularly races across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line to the Moslem sector dodging shells and sniper fire to defuse bombs The biggest bomb he has dismantled was in the <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hassan </LOCATION> district of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1983. It contained 1,320 pounds of TNT with four Katyusha rockets attached to it, enough to pulverize a city block. <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON> said it was apparently planted by the Israelis before they withdrew from west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after their 1982 invasion. `` That was probably the worst disaster I've prevented,'' he said in an interview in his elegant penthouse apartment in the <LOCATION> Sad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Boushrieh </LOCATION> district of Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The stocky <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON> sat stroking his Siamese cat Rambo on his lap as he talked dispassionately about his spine-chilling exploits, gesticulating with hands missing three fingertips. He lost one fingertip on his right hand when he grabbed a detonator, taken from a bomb he had defused, that a police officer was playing with. It exploded in <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON>'s hand. He lost two fingertips on his other hand in 1982 when he stepped on a mine after he had defused a bomb in a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla base in the mountains overlooking <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He was also wounded in the chest and feet. `` That cost me three months in hospital,'' <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON> said. Talking of his nerve-wracking exploits seemed somehow incongruous amid the comfortable domesticity of Persian carpets, brass ornaments and exotic Oriental decor in his marble-floored lounge. <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> as a teen-ager when <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was still ruled by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and served with special forces and demolition teams in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I was with de Gaulle's Free French forces in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> when I heard about the American atom bomb dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> Aug. 6, 1945,'' he recalled. `` It sort of kindled my interest in explosives.'' After joining the Lebanese army in 1946, <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON> became <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s top explosives expert But he really came into his own when the civil war erupted in 1975 and the car bombings started. `` I operate with great faith in God,'' <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON> said. `` But I rely mainly on intuition _ and a little bit of luck. `` I can tell the kind of bomb I've got to tackle the moment I see it. I try to disconnect it as quickly as possible. I feel as if it's placed under the bed of one of my children,'' he said `` I never panic. From the moment I see the bomb, I know what has to be done. `` The bombs do n't frighten me. But I'm always afraid of the people who planted them.'' <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON> said the first assassination attempt against him came as he was defusing a car bomb in the <LOCATION> Barbir </LOCATION> neighborhood of Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Sept. 19, 1975. `` Two bullets hit my neck and chest, but I managed to finish dismantling the bomb before I collapsed. I stayed two months in a hospital that time.'' Gunmen shot at him, and missed, three years later, as he was defusing a bomb near the entrance to a movie house in the Moslem sector. The third assassination attempt was in 1985 while he was visiting the <PERSON> Helou </PERSON> police station in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` Someone tossed a hand grenade into the room,'' he said. `` I threw myself to the floor to grab it and threw it out the window into the parking lot. No one was hurt.'' <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON> was retired from the army in 1980, but was immediately hired by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think of quitting,'' he said. `` When I look in the eyes of people when I arrive to tackle a bomb, I see their faith in me. I'll fight the bombers as long as I live.

<HEAD>Eldercare Is Here</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Child-care became an important employee benefit when a bulge of youngsters worked its way through the population. It still is, but now Americans are growing older, and elder-care is on the way. It is coming not simply because of demographic dictate; business efficiency might have even more to do with the development. Whatever, a growing number of companies concerned with their own future are considering it. Basic to their thinking is the realization that nearly one-fourth of a typical employer's workforce already provides adult care-giving services _ for a parent, grandparent or spouse. Generally, such services are provided directly and personally at home. Many of the corporate employees who provide these services hold critical positions, and as a result their work performance is sometimes less than efficient. Their inability to meet the highest standards often is related to the strain of their dual reponsibilities. The problem, therefore, becomes a concern of corporate management. <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanger </PERSON>, who holds a doctorate in gerontology, recently completed a study for <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> <PERSON> Meidinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, an international adviser on employee benefits. She found sound reasons for considering elder-care. She observes that with more and more women entering the workforce, the number of employees with at-home responsibilities is hardly likely to decline. These employees often are in their 30s and 40s, which means that not only do they have valuable experience but also years of further service to offer. Already, she suggests, there is evidence that the home-work conflict may interfere with their performance. It shows up, she says, in such behavior as missing work, turning down overtime and training, and even quitting. The corporation's role, she says, has two aspects: Long-term care insurance to pay for medical and associated support services, and special assistance to those workers with responsibilities for an older adult. Her definition of elder-care refers primarily to the second aspect, and has as its goal `` to improve the productivity and the health and quality of life of employed care-givers.'' And, you might add, the company too. The benefit helps the worker cope with three things that make taking care of elders difficult. First, she points out, the frail elderly often have interrelated needs that involve medicine, finance, and social and psychological factors. Next, the care of the elderly often involves conflicting opinions and wishes of a number of individuals _ the patient, spouse, siblings, children. Most of the care-givers can use help in resolving these conflicts. Finally, existing community resources consist of a maze of federal, state and local public programs, private non-profit agencies and for-profit providers. The red tape can be overwhelming. The elder-care program as she envisions it can be indirect and direct. The indirect programs involve personnel policies or benefits which are potentially of value to all employees, such as flextime, personal leaves and job sharing. Direct programs include information, including printed materials, lectures and other sources; and referral programs to specific agencies, nursing homes and other resources. In addition, they might include support groups and counseling, and even access to an adult day-care center for the older relative. Reimbursement programs also might be used to subsidize the cost of respite care. All this sounds expensive, as most benefits are, not just in themselves but as a growing percentage of business costs. But, according to the report, the cost of an elder-care program is usually `` modest and clearly defined.'' At a time when employers are resisting additional benefits and even taking away some benefits granted earlier, <PERSON> Stanger </PERSON> believes they have something to gain with elder-care, because it addresses so specific a need. She calls it an opportunity for them.

 Treasures even greater than those in King <PERSON> Tut </PERSON>'s tomb may still be lying under the desert sands of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` When I'm asked if there's another <PERSON> Tut </PERSON>'s tomb out there, I always answer at least one, maybe more,'' said <PERSON> Zahi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> pyramids area outside <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and the huge ancient cemetery of <LOCATION> Sakkara </LOCATION>, 11 miles to the south. `` My guess is we've found no more than 30 percent of what's buried After all, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is 97 percent desert. ... We ca n't begin to imagine what the sands have hidden.'' The tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun _ King <PERSON> Tut </PERSON> _ was found almost intact in 1922 by the British archaeologist <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. It took <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> 11 years more to document the hoard of gold, semiprecious stones, furniture and knickknacks stuffed into the makeshift tomb dug into the hills of southern <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Valley of the <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Tutankhamun </PERSON> was a lesser king and the discovery of his tomb left archaeologists to wonder what treasures might have accompanied ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s great monarchs into the afterlife. Some intriguing trophies have eluded both early archaeologists and their modern successors: _ Mummies and relics of <LOCATION> Pharaoh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION>, whose pyramid on <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION> is among the world's best-known monuments _ The tomb of the architect <PERSON> Imhotep </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Sakkara </LOCATION>, where more than 4,600 years ago he built for <PERSON> Pharaoh </PERSON> <PERSON> Zozer </PERSON> a step pyramid, an architectural feat that quickly evolved into the true pyramid Generations of later Egyptians worshipped <PERSON> Imhotep </PERSON> as a god. _ At least seven tombs of royalty and officials from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, the era of Tutankhamun and the Ramses line _ The tomb of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> the Great, the young Macedonian conqueror who died at the age of 33 in 323 B.C Records say he wanted to be buried in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Siwa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oasis </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, but finally was encased in a gold coffin in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> city he founded. _ The 50,000-man army of <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> conqueror Cambyses, which vanished in a sandstorm in 525 B.C while en route to <LOCATION> Siwa </LOCATION> to punish the powerful priests of the temple of the Siwan Oracle. Egyptian officials realize the historical value that any of those finds would entail. But the mammoth job of preserving what is said already to be the world's greatest national storehouse of antiquities has halted treasure hunts. `` I'm trying to keep what's standing, standing,'' said <PERSON> Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` What I'd like to do is to keep what's buried, buried until we can deal with it. It's usually safer for the pieces not to be exposed to modern pollutants.'' As <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s population rapidly expands, however, roadways, gas lines and housing projects unearth a vast ancient legacy just beneath the ground. Often, excavations are rescue missions. Archaeological work in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> generally is restricted to the cooler winter months, and last season's work was filled with surprises. <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> said the results give a glimpse of what lies ahead when archaeologists begin anew in September. In January five magnificent statues that rival the loveliest artwork the ancient Egyptians produced were unearthed in a pit beneath the tourist-trampled courtyard of <ORGANIZATION> Luxor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>. Seventeen more statues, many broken, later were discovered in the cache. In March a mummy of a young woman, her <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> smile frozen in a gypsum mask, was found on <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION> a few feet from a roadway through the pyramids. Other discoveries ranged from gold to fortresses, some found on sites once impenetrable except by camel or donkey, now accessible by paved roads. One area to be surveyed in the fall is <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION>'s East Cemetery, a Pharaonic burial ground for royalty and officials beside <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION> pyramid. `` I'm sure we're going to find an intact burial of a prince or official, because the area never has been excavated properly,'' <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> said. `` In <LOCATION> Sakkara </LOCATION>, where we know <PERSON> Imhotep </PERSON> is buried, you do n't even need to have shovels and picks to find tombs. You can just use your hands, dig in the sand. They're there.'' Modern man owes rich finds to the ingenuity of ancient priests, who reburied important pieces to ensure survival during politically troubled times, <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> said. These caches, which may explain the <ORGANIZATION> Luxor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> statues, give clues to what may still be hidden. He believes the pyramids area contains at least one major cache from the reign of Old Kingdom Pharaoh <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION>, whose relics include the world's largest pyramid, a full-sized boat and an ivory statue so small it can be held between two fingers. `` I think out there is <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION>' mummy, maybe statues, maybe personal items,'' <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> said. `` Four priests were in charge of their safety, but in the next dynasty -LRB- after <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION> -RRB- his memory soured. There was a revolt. His monuments were damaged, perhaps because he made himself a god.'' <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> believes that like the <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION> find the <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION> discovery will be accidental. `` We have magnificent statues of his successors -LRB- and -RRB- delicate funerary items of <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION>' mother, ... so we know such things did exist,'' he said. `` One day you'll be digging a power line, or cleaning, and there they'll be.'' <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> thinks chance also may locate the long-sought tomb of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> the Great in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>. `` We have early descriptions of his tomb, but <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> has gone through many changes,'' he said. `` We're not going to find the tomb, if it even still exists, by going after it. We'll find it by accident, when somebody's digging a foundation for a house or installing sewer lines.'' <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> insists that people who think incredible discoveries remain to be found are n't dealing in fantasy. `` We've got too much evidence,'' he said: `` Kings without tombs, places we know existed but never were found.''

<HEAD>Five Yale Men Bare Their Souls in Documentary on Midlife Transitions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GORDON FAIRCLOUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 They look like a rather unexceptional bunch of middle-aged men. Some have receding hairlines, some have slight paunches. They are a former prosecutor from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> movie producer, a businessman from upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, psychoanalyst and a banker from <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Like most men in their 40s, they have been struggling through that period of self-examination. What sets them apart is that these five have dared to expose the torments of their midlife crises to the glare of television lights. The result, a 90-minute documentary that will air on public television stations across the country beginning Wednesday, is a series of candid discussions of marriage, divorce, homosexuality, infidelity and virility. `` What we wanted to do was take a microscope and look at some real people and hopefully enable the audience to take a look at themselves,'' said executive producer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, who began the project as a tribute to fellow members of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> Class of 1963 for their 25th reunion. What emerged is not simply the nostalgic lookback he envisioned. `` Men are somehow, in this culture, supposed to be strong and hold their feelings inside and never crack,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, who like the others profiled, graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> in'63. The film is `` very worthwhile because it shows people can sit down and discuss some very sensitive issues and people will listen,'' said <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, the banker from <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Snodgrass </PERSON>, the psychotherapist, says in the film: `` Life for me now is very different from when I was graduating in 1963.. I thought I would have a colonial 1 -LCB- - story with a green lawn and maybe a picket fence and a wife who would meet me in pearls and high heels with a cocktail at 5:15. <PERSON> Snodgrass </PERSON> left his wife of 14 years and his two children to live with another man. `` What you're left with are memories of your children looking through the venetian blinds as you drive away,'' he says. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the former prosecutor from <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, who now works as a lobbyist, tells of resigning from his post when he found himself plotting to kill a man who had escaped punishment for burning down a friend's house. -LRB- The man was later convicted of the crime. -RRB- <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>'s forehead glistens with perspiration as he describes the destruction of his marriage. One day, out of the blue, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> says, his wife told him she wanted a divorce. The reason she gave, he says, is that she wanted children but could not have them with <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, who had had a vasectomy five years earlier when the couple decided not to have a family. `` I'm crawling,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> says, `` but I'm moving.'' <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Noyes </PERSON>, the businessman from <LOCATION> Oneida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, was fired from his job at a company founded by his grandfather. At the time of the filming, he was working to get a small computer company off the ground. `` I wanted my children to be proud of me,'' <PERSON> Noyes </PERSON> says. `` Particularly after I left the company I was most worried about that, that they'd think I was a failure.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohmer </PERSON>, the movie producer, tells of being divorced twice and being fired from his job as president of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. He also tells of anti-Semitic slurs he encountered at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>. `` When I tell that story ... I say I reached over and punched the guy in the nose, but I did n't ... I just sat there and absorbed it,'' he says. `` I have tried to understand my life and do that in a rational sense and push away the emotions,'' <PERSON> Sohmer </PERSON> says. `` But now I find that what I really have to do is not understand my life but pick it up in my arms and embrace it.'' Knight, the banker, says he always thought he would have `` a little house in the suburbs ... I would have very much a 9-to-5 sort of job. -LRB- My wife -RRB- would be a typical housewife, raising children.'' But he and his wife have been unable to have children: he has a low sperm count and she has endometriosis. When <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> decided to make a film for the class reunion, he enlisted the help of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> psychologist <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, who devised a questionnaire asking members of the class to describe where they were in their lives. More than 500 men responded, about 200 agreeing to talk on camera. Five were chosen to appear in the film. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the documentary was `` more than I thought I was getting into when I answered that questionnaire. I did that because I needed the answers for myself.'' <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said he was somewhat apprehensive about the film's national debut The head of the only bank in a small farming community, he is well-known to townspeople who, he said, will certainly be tuning in. `` If I had my personal druthers, I would pack up and take an extended trip to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<HEAD>Whether Housing Prices Will Wither</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the popular participant sports of economic and financial researchers is terrorizing homeowners with tales about a coming price collapse. Some reports arise out of Wall Street, which tends to think of housing as a competitor of stocks and bonds for the investor's dollar Some originate in academe, some in the popular press and in publishing houses. A few years ago a well publicized book forecast an imminent collapse in housing prices. It did n't happen, at least to an extent discernible in the usual statistics. But even after the dread time had passed, the book sold. The reason is obvious: The biggest investment of most people is the home in which they live. It is a roof over their head, a symbol of participation in economic growth, a savings account, a treasure, a pension. It is to be guarded. The latest assault on the senses of homeowners, `` The Baby Boom, The Baby Bust, and the Housing Market,'' carries the imprimatur of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, highly esteemed by economists. Authors <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Mankiw </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> conclude that the real price of housing, inflation excluded, could decline by 3 percent a year over the next 20 years, for a total decline of as much as 47 percent by the year 2007. They reason that demand will be falling off sharply, leaving a relative oversupply, a reversal of the more customary situation in which there is growing demand and sometimes insufficient supply. Why should demand fall? Because the baby boomers, born after World War II _ 4.3 million babies were born at the peak in 1957 _ will be replaced by the baby busters. At the trough of the baby bust in 1973 only 3.14 million babies were born. First came the birth bulge, followed in the late 1970s by rising housing sales. Now, say the authors, the birth bust will undermine housing demand in the 1990s and into the next century. The supply-demand ratio will be changed. Will it happen? Obviously, the authors believe so. In the housing industry, however, it is being accepted as but another in a long series of threats, most of which have never developed full profiles. A 47 percent decline in housing prices, points out critic <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Megbolugbe </PERSON>, would produce what many would consider a dubious possibility if not an absurdity, that is, a market of houses priced below the cost of production. Megbolugbe, senior housing policy analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> publication, would n't deny that prices might fall for a time in some markets. But he and colleagues foresee no plunge. <PERSON> Gopal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahluwalia </PERSON>, research director for the publication, points out that in some markets, as in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> earlier in this decade, housing prices can fall when the entire economy falters. It happened in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> too, in the `` rust belt'' days of the 1970s. But housing prices there have largely recovered. Housing people like to say that housing prices are protected, to some immeasurable extent, because land can not be reproduced on a large scale. In some communities, in fact, land is assessed higher than the houses on it. There might be slow periods, says <PERSON> Ahluwalia </PERSON>. In fact, there have always been slow periods in housing, followed and preceded by active periods. Price increases of the magnitude that occurred in the past 15 years are n't likely, as the Home Builders see it, but they view a collapse as far less likely. A home of your own, says <PERSON> Ahluwalia </PERSON>, is still the very best hedge you can have against inflation.

<HEAD>Award-Winning Drill Team Helps Inner-City Members</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The children who swing their hips, bob their heads and fling their knees and elbows up and out to throbbing drumbeats have left crowds wide-eyed from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to the nation's capital and beyond. The Marching Cobras, an award-winning drill team, also leave a mark on the members, many of them from poor, inner-city homes with one parent. `` For one, you get a chance to travel and do all sorts of things, and another, it keeps you out of trouble,'' said <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, 15, a Cobra for five years. `` I think I might be on the street and in trouble if I was n't in the group. ... There are no down sides to being in the Cobras.'' `` I've made a lot of friends in the Cobras,'' said <PERSON> A'yanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, 14, who has been in the drill team three years. `` And it makes you learn independence, and responsibility for your uniform, your performance and everything.'' <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, drillmaster for 20 years, said it's virtually impossible to understand what the Cobras are without seeing their flashy uniforms and intricate routines, elbows and knees pumping 1 -LCB- times for every drumbeat. As much a part of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as its fountains, the Cobras average 300 invitations a year and accept 100 to 200. They performed 117 times last year, including what <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> called a `` dream come true,'' for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` He kind of pepped up when we started,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` I really wanted to go grab him and get him to dance, but the security men, we could n't go past this line, or that line. But he would have liked it.'' The Cobras made their first overseas trip in February, to <LOCATION> Nice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where they competed in the City of Carnivals Festival. They won awards in three categories, including best international drill team. `` We saw <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION>, stayed in the best hotels, ate the best meals,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` I'd never get to do that by myself. And here are these kids going to a place they never even heard of.'' For the members, being in the Cobras is `` their big chance,'' he said. `` When we went to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, we found out that some of the kids have never been to the airport, they've never been to the -LRB- Country Club -RRB- Plaza,'' an affluent <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> restaurant and shopping area. The Cobras began in 1969 when <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> coached a group of seventh-grade boys to dance in a talent show. That group evolved into a drill team and eventually became the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Marching Cobras _ so named after a school librarian watching from a third-floor window said it looked like a snake. Whites are n't excluded but all the members, who range in age from 8 to 18, are black, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think there's too many whites who want to come to the inner city to practice.'' Money problems nearly ended the Cobras in 1986, but the team affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which eased the money crunch, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` Until we came to the boys and girls clubs, we raised the money ourselves. Bake sales, car washes, raffles. `` But in some ways we were happier when we were scuffing it. The kids now are getting spoiled. They know they get the uniform, so they do n't take care of it like they did before. If the parents paid $ 70 or $ 80 for it, it would be taken care of.'' The glitzy uniforms cost $ 150 - $ 175 each, so only 85 Cobras can be in uniform at any time The colors vary each year. Also each year, two Cobras are honored as the mascot and senior imperial. The mascot wears a rubber cobra headpiece and leads the group. `` The person who wears the cobra headpiece is the most outstanding member,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` They have to compete for it. An 11-year-old dreams of wearing the mascot head. It's prestigious and it's an honor.'' The Cobras are based at the Boys and <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. The windowless brown brick building squats in the inner city, clusters of children lounging outside. Cars stop on the street, disgorging more children. Practice is three times a week. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s office exhibits honors from past performances. Plaques, trophies, photographs and letters cover the walls. A box of awards sits in a corner. After 20 years, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is more than drillmaster, and many members call him `` Dad.'' They knock on his door to tell him of problems or ask advice. Being on the team keeps them off the street, which has always been his goal. `` Children have changed. The kids are n't as interested in extracurricular activities. We need to spend even more time with them now than before, because they spend more time on the streets now. And the streets are worse.''

 The idea of merging the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>'s smallest English-speaking islands into a single nation or federation has been around for half a century with little ever coming of it But now that a major trading partner, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, is moving toward economic integration, the fervor of unity advocates has increased. Prime Minister <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Grenadines </ORGANIZATION>, a leader of the most promising attempt at political union since the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Federation </LOCATION> collapsed nearly 30 years ago, maintains the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> faces economic disaster if it does n't unite by the time the 12 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> form a single market by the end of 1992. Mostly at stake are <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> bananas. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, attending a recent regional meeting on <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, said that without political unity, individual islands wo n't have the political power to protect their banana sales in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> after the European trade barriers fall. `` Who will respect you when you go to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> representing a ministate? How much time will they have for you?'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` We do n't need unity to survive. We need it to get our voice heard in the international community.'' `` I'm bone-tired of trying to convince people,'' he added. `` I think we've lost the momentum in spite of how urgently it's needed.'' <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Organization of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said, `` If you go to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and say you represent a chain of islands, the impact is greater than if you say you represent one. The <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> benefits today from preferential trade access for its agricultural products into the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. Under current agreements, <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> bananas are protected in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which does not import bananas from other regions. <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> bananas grow on small farms and are more expensive than those mass-produced in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. With the dismantling of <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> trade barriers, <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> bananas will have to compete in an open market. British consumers then could be expected to buy the cheaper Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bananas and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>'s $ 175 million annual market would collapse. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Federation </LOCATION> was founded in 1958 as the first attempt at political integration but disintegrated four years later when <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> withdrew. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, supported by Prime Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Compton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>, renewed the unity drive at the 1987 summit meeting of the Organization of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a regional sub-grouping within the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> and Common Market. The idea of creating a single country or a regional federation of states by mid-1989 out of the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands of <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kitts-Nevis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> was approved in principle. But <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION> withdrew almost immediately and was followed later by <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitts-Nevis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Compton </PERSON> still favor political union of the remaining four, known as the <LOCATION> Windward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands share a central bank, common currency and high court. All are small and relatively undeveloped with a combined English-speaking population of 400,000. In land mass, the largest is <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> with 289 square miles and the smallest is <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, the only remaining British colony of the group, with just 39 square miles. Geographically, they resemble a 450-mile kite tail stretching from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in the north to <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> in the south. Their populations range from 12,000 in <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION> to 119,000 in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>. Detractors say a political marriage is unrealistic; each island is as unique as any nation, regardless of size. They say economic integration, not political, is what is needed. `` We go to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and fight tooth-and-nail to portray small island states as having special characteristics and requiring special treatment. We can not ignore this reality in our forums,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kitts-Nevis </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview. `` We already go to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a team speaking for the region,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is not a national front, it's a regional front. The process should be the same for us.'' The Windwards export 220,000 tons of bananas a year to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, accounting for two-thirds of the bananas consumed in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The four islands plan to hold a political union referendum after parliamentary elections, still unscheduled, are held in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> Community, an organization of 13 English-speaking states that includes the <ORGANIZATION> Windwards </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Leewards </ORGANIZATION>, already has taken steps to form a common market. `` At present there is little immediate prospect for political unity,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> said in welcoming heads of government to a recent meeting here. `` But we continue to knock at the door for closer cooperation and cry fervently for economic integration.'' <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> leaders say economic unity is imperative if they are to survive the trading blocs being formed around the world, including the recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> trade agreement. Prime Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> has called it `` the only way a group of small countries can survive.''

 Tourism has n't caught on in <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>, the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, and the city remains pretty much what it was when it was closed to foreigners. An AP correspondent visited the city recently as part of a tour conducted by the Soviet Foreign Ministry. Here are a few leaves from his notebook.

 The hills of the long-forbidden <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> port drop into the ocean, and as an evening fog settles across the water, a white, 30-foot fiberglass sloop drifts along the shore in a light breeze. The sailboat flies no colors, and for a moment, the scene could be any port city anywhere. But on closer inspection, the boat yields a clue. A woman, standing in the cockpit, wears a shin-length cotton dress instead of shorts, slacks or a swimsuit. The woman might look out of place aboard a boat in a Western harbor, but yachting clothes are practically unknown in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The port is <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>, the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> on the Sea of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Although ostensibly opened to foreigners last year, the security-conscious city permits few tourists and has not yet adapted to its new status.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 A packet of picture postcards contains several views of the city, including some aerial views, but there is no sign of the Soviet fleet, the pride of <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>. The docks at the city's center are crowded with destroyers, cruisers, anti-submarine ships of various descriptions and an aircraft carrier under repair. Just around a point from the downtown wharves, rows of nuclear-powered subs are tied up in submarine pens. While much is made of the navy's multiethnic makeup, <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> looks as <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In a city of more than 600,000 in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the appearance of people on the street testifies to their European ancestry, and there are few signs of the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nationalities whose homelands are geographically much closer.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Having been closed to tourism for so long, <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> has no Intourist hotel, where foreigners are charged extraordinary rates for rooms that would be rented to Soviets for a fraction of the price. As a result, when a group arrived from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> recently under the sponsorship of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, those who paid upon arrival were charged $ 18.75 to $ 23.50 for a three-night stay. When word spread that the guests were foreigners and should be charged the rate set by Intourist, the state tourism monopoly, those who had yet to pay were charged 10 times what the others had paid.

 Most of the city's architecture is of the same, monotonous concrete-slab construction that characterizes other Soviet cities, but several pre-revolutionary buildings remain around the central square. One is a former Japanese Consulate, built before the Russo-Japanese War at the turn of the century. It is now occupied by state offices. A building once famed for its <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> restaurant is being renovated and may one day serve fastidious diners again. A few blocks away is one of the few visible signs that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms reach as far as <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>. Chinese craftsmen are building a Chinese-Soviet joint-venture restaurant. A Soviet bystander professes amazement at the workers' attention to detail as they fit perfectly symmetrical logs to frame a traditional, multistep pagoda-style roof over the entrance to the otherwise ordinary concrete block building.

 Expansionist <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> sent soldiers and pioneers to tame its Far Eastern regions about the same time the American West was being settled. <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> was founded in 1856, <LOCATION> Khabarovsk </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Amur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> two years later, <LOCATION> Blagoveshchensk </LOCATION> on the Chinese border also in 1858. In 1891, workers began building the <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> railway station, which was to be the eastern terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railroad. `` The design was copied from the <LOCATION> Yaroslavl </LOCATION> station'' in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a guide explains. `` It symbolizes the unity of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> because people started out from <LOCATION> Yaroslavl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> to get here.'' Even today, that is a seven-day journey.

<TEXT>
 The quicker route is by plane, about nine hours from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but there are few direct flights to <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>. The airport is no longer off limits but remains uninviting to civilian travelers. Squadrons of long-range reconnaissance Bears and Badger medium-range bombers, their sleek snouts cloaked in canvas or draped in camouflage netting, are tucked into earthen revetments beside the runway, the red stars on their tails giving mute testimony to the primary function of the military airfield.

 Thousands of miles from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the name <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> kindles fire in the hearts of young men still smarting from the wounds of the Soviet adventure in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In a riverside square in this century-old Siberian city, a platoon of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> veterans staged a bit of street theater one evening recently to demonstrate their reserve group's combat training, play some popular songs _ and take a swipe at the Nobel Peace laureate regarded as the founder of the Soviet human rights movement. Between numbers played by a military band in fatigue uniforms, an announcer told the few hundred people in the audience, `` We all remember how academician <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> insulted us at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was heckled during the parliamentary session in June and lambasted by a parade of speakers who accused him of blaspheming the military in an interview in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> earlier in the year in which he was quoted as saying Soviet pilots killed soldiers they could not save from being captured by Afghan rebels. The 68-year-old physicist and now a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> deputy endured almost seven years in exile in the closed city of Gorky for his outspoken opposition to the Soviet military intervention that began in December 1979. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he would not retract his charge, pending the outcome of an investigation by Soviet authorities. The emotional, nationally broadcast attack on <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> reverberated weeks later in this Far Eastern city built on the banks of the great <LOCATION> Amur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to protect against <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> invasion 4,400 miles from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The reservists loaded their assault rifles and machine guns with blanks and climbed atop an armored personnel carrier that bore a red banner proclaiming, `` <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> _ in my heart forever.'' With police motioning the crowd to make way, a squad of troops ambled up the street and was gunned down by mock <ORGANIZATION> Mujahadeen </ORGANIZATION> rebels lying in ambush by the side of the road. Guns blazing, the armored personnel carrier sped to the rescue, and the `` wounded'' <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers were hastily loaded into an ambulance truck that escaped in a hail of fire, its driver nearly grazing the crowd in a hair-raising demonstration of evasive driving tactics. The chatter of machine guns and ear-splitting roar of artillery rocked the night as first the truck was halted by fire, then the personnel carrier was captured by rebels and recaptured by the Soviets. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> men risked their lives over and over until they finally succeeded in hauling their wounded to safety. The last Soviet troops pulled out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15 after more than nine years of fighting, but as the street drama in <LOCATION> Khabarovsk </LOCATION> illustrated, the withdrawal was no instant cure for what President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> once called his nation's `` bleeding wound.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> has spent his entire professional life with <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, and as chairman of the tobacco giant he's led a $ 7.2 billion takeover spree into businesses ranging from insurance to department stores. Now the 58-year-old chairman is finding out what it's like on the receiving end of a bid: an unsolicited $ 21 billion, debt-financed takeover offer from a trio led by swashbuckling investor Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>. `` I suppose it's definitely ironic,'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said. `` My reaction to the bid was one of surprise, initially, not that we thought that we were invulnerable. But I mean I certainly thought that this type of raid was unlikely.'' The <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> offer, financed largely with borrowed money, would be the second biggest ever if successful, after the record $ 25 billion <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> takeover by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. In an interview, <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> described <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> and partners as avaricious financiers, whose plan to break up BAT and sell pieces to help pay for a takeover is `` just naked asset stripping.'' In contrast, <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said, BAT's acquisitions of other companies have been friendly, with the notable exception of a $ 5.2 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> earlier this year. Even in that case, <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said, the takeover was a strategic, long-term investment. <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> is a large man with graying hair, blue eyes and florid face, who began working for BAT nearly 40 years ago when it was still known as British <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He became chairman in 1982. The BAT battle may boil down to a struggle between <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, renowned for profitable forays for other companies, and <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON>, a modest but intensely determined one-company man who knows how a takeover strategist thinks. <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON>'s defense so far has been to raise the alarms, and to hope that the takeover bid will get stuck in a regulatory quagmire. BAT will ask <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Office of Fair Trading to refer the matter to the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to decide whether the bid violates the public interest, <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said. `` We are certainly using our political friends to try and bring pressure to bear,'' he said. <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> also predicted the governments of other countries where BAT operates will raise concern about <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s bid, particularly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where regulatory authorities will want detailed plans on how a takeover would affect Farmers, one of the nation's biggest insurers. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> and his two partners, British banker <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> and Australian entrepreneur <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, have attacked <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON>'s strategy of diversifying into financial services and retailing The trio's newly formed firm, <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which announced the takeover offer July 11, said it intends to sell everything except BAT's tobacco business. `` We are clearly fighting it on our record,'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said. `` Our record, quite contrary to what <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> claims, has been, we think, outstanding.'' Since <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> took BAT's helm, earnings per share have grown 18.5 percent per year, compared with a British company average of 11.5 percent, he said. Put another way, the chairman said, $ 160 invested in the company in April 1981 today are worth $ 1,829. BAT's earnings rose 21 percent to $ 1.5 billion last year on a 3 percent revenue gain to $ 28 billion. The company owns a range of well-known products and services, including <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> and Kool cigarettes; <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>'s and Argos stores; <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> insurance products; Allied Dunbar financial services; and <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> <PERSON> Teape </PERSON> paper. <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON>, son of a colonial civil servant, was born in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in 1930. He was sent to school in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> during World War II, attended <ORGANIZATION> Ampleforth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a boys boarding school in <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION>, in northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and then served in the Irish Guards, rising to second lieutenant. Skipping a university education, <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> in 1950 at age 20 as a management trainee. He was posted to <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and finally to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION>, where he was general manager. In 1962, he returned to <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> headquarters as a marketing adviser, but five years later he was off again, this time as general manager in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Some postings were better than others. `` I had three and a half years in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. It was a time I often was wondering whether I was going to spend all my life there and did n't want to,'' he said. Living half his life abroad `` made me fairly adaptable, fairly resilient, fairly self-reliant, with a wide range of interests,'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said. Although he has never worked for any company except BAT, he said, `` I'd like to think I have n't had one career but I've had several careers, in different countries, in different businesses.'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> rose through BAT's management hierarchy quickly, joining the board of directors at age 39. His salary as chairman is low by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standards, at about $ 720,000 a year. Asked to describe his style, <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said: `` I like to think that I listen to other people and then take a decision and try and get involved in ensuring that it's implemented, not by telling people exactly what to do, but by encouraging them and guiding them.'' What does he think his 310,000 employee worldwide say about him? `` Probably things unprintable,'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said. `` I used to say that about my bosses.'' Married and the father of two, <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> lives in west <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, owns an English country home, and admits an addiction to golf. His handicap is somewhere between 10 and 20, he says, adding, `` depends who I'm playing.'' In this latest boardroom game, <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> has a lot at stake personally, although he insists he is n't acting to protect his own job. `` I have n't actually got much more than a couple of years before I retire so its not as devastating a thing as if I was 40 or something like that,'' he said. `` I can say goodbye.''

<HEAD>Gambling on the Future of the Black-Footed Ferret</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SYBILLE CANYON, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tucked beneath the ridge of rattlesnake-infested <ORGANIZATION> Sybille </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION>, a barbed-wire fence and burglar alarms guard a growing colony of black-footed ferrets, once viewed as the rarest mammal on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Low-light TV cameras feed the ferrets' nocturnal frolicking and mating to 14 monitors and video recorders. Nearby, an enclosed prairie dog town is ready for the day humans teach the ferrets how to kill their natural prey. If all goes well, the weasel-like animals will be returned to the wild in 1991, starting with recolonization of the prairie dog community near <LOCATION> Meeteetse </LOCATION> where ferrets were found in 1981 after having been thought extinct. Success would be the payoff to a gamble begun by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department in 1985 despite the failure of other breeding programs. Thirty-four births last year let state veterinarians <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON> set up colonies in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>; more than 60 kits have been born this year. `` Counting the animals from this year, there's 100 in the world,'' said <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON>. `` Any other species, people would still be highly concerned over their survival. But most people figure they're on their way to recovery and that's it. No big thing anymore. But there can be a setback at any time.'' `` We're still pretty precarious, tenuous, whatever you want to say,'' said <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>. The other colonies are `` life insurance, if you want to call it.'' The ferrets did n't always need such insurance. They once roamed the West from southern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, inhabiting colonies of tunneling prairie dogs. As ranchers poisoned the prairies to kill predators, prairie dog populations fluctuated and the ferrets became more susceptible to disease. In 1982, just 61 ferrets were thought to be in the Meeteetse colony in north-central <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. The population hit 129 by 1984, but tailed off to less than two dozen in 1985 when the decision to breed the animals was made. The breeding program started dismally. Six ferrets brought in from <LOCATION> Meeteetse </LOCATION> the first year died of canine distemper, prompting a 1986 decision to capture the colony's remaining 18 ferrets. Those included Scarface and <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>, a father and daughter, who in June 1987 gave their species a fighting chance with a litter of six kits here. Their offspring and those of other `` founders'' are dominant as <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON> try to diversify the gene pool. `` We have what we think were eight founder animals, because they were brought in from geographically different areas, and they were observed in the wild before being caught so we know they are n't at least full sibs, and some of them ... have n't been related for a couple generations,'' said <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON>. `` We follow a genetic plan each season for breeding, which makes it a little more difficult. You ca n't just put the female in heat with the best male you have.'' So far, the 1989 pairings have been between unrelated ferrets. `` Last year was just about the same. Only the first year we had a father and daughter breeding, because those were the only animals that would mate,'' he said. `` We should end up with an animal for release that's much more diverse than was ever in the population'' at <LOCATION> Meeteetse </LOCATION>. The work is conducted in relative seclusion at the complex here. The innocuous green building sits behind barbed wire and has a sophisticated alarm system prompted by a $ 10,000 reward offered by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for information leading to the discovery of a wild ferret colony. `` That's enough stimulus for some folks to try something,'' said <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON>. Access to the building is limited to assigned personnel and visitors approved by <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>. Only the veterinarians and assistants are allowed into the ferrets' area, and then only after a disinfectant shower. Fear of disaster has produced an evacuation system enabling one biologist to remove all ferrets from the 8,000-square-foot building within 10 minutes. Nearby, an enclosed prairie dog community built by humans stands ready for use in teaching the captive ferrets how to kill their natural prey. To keep the ferrets healthy and prepare them for release the vets feed them hamsters, prairie dogs, and commercial mink feed. As the kits mature their menu changes from a gruel-like mixture to chunks of hamsters, live hamsters and live prairie dogs. The vets raise their own hamsters and isolate captured prairie dogs before feeding them to the ferrets to ensure a disease-free meal. While <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON> work on recovering the species, the department's non-game coordinator, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakleaf </PERSON>, concentrates on finding areas to reintroduce ferrets and following up leads to any wild colonies. This fall, officials will review other sites in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and other states where the ferrets once roamed. What is required are tracts of at least 6,000 acres, a requirement that could make finding new homes difficult because of the pressures already existing on public lands, <PERSON> Oakleaf </PERSON> acknowledged. Those returned to the wilds will be somewhat protected from canine distempter, the deadly disease common in domestic and wild animals. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> veterinary researchers have developed a vaccine specially suited to ferrets that is good for three or four months and not only kills the virus but stimulates the ferrets' immune systems Work is under way on a vaccine that would protect them for a year or more. After that, they're on their own. `` Nobody is talking about any continuous catch-and-release vaccination of these wild animals to protect them. Once you get populations in the wild you'll be able to let the disease run its course,'' <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON> said. As for the possibility of other wild colonies, <PERSON> Oakleaf </PERSON> is not optimistic. `` There's always the potential that there's a population somewhere that we missed,'' he said. `` But if you look at what history tells us ... it's pretty evident that ferrets have been declining for a long time. `` Sure, there could be one or two populations out there that we have n't found. But if we do n't find them fairly quickly ... you can count on them going extinct.''

<HEAD>A Water Buffalo In Every Pot? Low-Cholesterol Breed Gains Popularity</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

 High in exotic appeal and low in cholesterol, the water buffalo is hitting health-food shelves and haute-cuisine menus. To father-and-son ranchers Oley and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, the smelly, unsightly, ox-like animals are gentle giants with the potential to alleviate world hunger. To <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Niayesh </PERSON>, vice president <ORGANIZATION> Polarica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, Bubalus bubalis is pleasure for pampered palates _ at up to $ 17 a pound. `` I always have a freezer full of it,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Popenoe </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Popenoe </PERSON>, who is studying expansion of the breed, also has acquired a taste for rich mozzarella made from water buffalo milk. `` And the people who've eaten the hamburger say it's much better than beef burgers, because they do n't shrink,'' he said. `` A lot of people say the hamburgers are outstanding.'' There are hurdles, however, to water buffalo reaching an important place in the American diet. First, there's the small supply _ there are only about 3,000 of the homely critters in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And regulations make it costly and time-consuming to import animals from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and other sources. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Polarica </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> gourmet food wholesaler, managed to sell about 20,000 pounds last year, <PERSON> Niayesh </PERSON> said. When domestic sources ran short, he brought the dark-colored, lightly marbled goods from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. His customers ranged from golf and country clubs to swank restaurants and hotels; he sent 30 pounds to a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> bash honoring the king of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. `` These are middle - to higher-income people First, they wanted to have something different. Then they realized it's a good meat. Now they're using it where they used to use beef,'' he said. He now sells about 400 pounds a week of water buffalo tenderloin, the most preferred cut. The ` 21' Club in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has served water buffalo on special occasions for regular customers, although it is n't a regular offering, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Krindler </PERSON>, senior vice president of the posh restaurant. `` As people become aware that they have got to watch their cholesterol, they are going to turn to an alternative,'' he said. `` If it can be marketed or prepared right, who knows? `` Maybe we'll have water buffalo burgers _ grilled, as opposed to fried.'' During blind taste tests, <PERSON> Popenoe </PERSON> said, `` It comes out tasting about the same as beef, or people ca n't tell the difference.'' The Olsons, who tend 19, say there are many differences between buffalo on the hoof and the Herefords on their ranch near the <LOCATION> Arkansas-Texas </LOCATION> border. `` The water buffalo have 50 percent less cholesterol, 25 percent less fat, but, we think, a lot more intellect,'' said <PERSON> Oley </PERSON>, 67, who retired to the ranch from a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lumber business. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, 30, said it's easy to think of the water buffaloes as pets, since the family has concentrated on breeding to build the herd, and not slaughtering. `` They'd come right in the house and watch TV. They are dirty and scruffy, but so gentle, docile. They're just a fabulous animal,'' said <PERSON> Oley </PERSON>. `` They seem to grow about twice as fast as our cattle,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>. They also cost about twice as much _ $ 1,500 for a water buffalo bull vs. about $ 700 for a <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> bull. A pregnant water buffalo brings about $ 3,500. Offsetting the purchase price, the <ORGANIZATION> Olsons </ORGANIZATION> say, is low maintenance. `` They've never been sick because they're so sturdy, and they eat about anything _ leaves, weeds, any kind of grass, whatever,'' but `` it's just a drain right now. We are n't making anything from them,'' he said. `` It could be a big money-maker some day,'' <PERSON> Popenoe </PERSON> said. `` There is a sizable population that would be interested in meat with lower cholesterol. The largest-growing segment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food market is exotic and ethnic, and this would fit nicely.''

<HEAD>Officials Link Crack Cocaine to Sharp Increase in Rural Syphilis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Women who trade sex for a brief high on crack are being blamed for a 69.7 percent increase in syphilis in rural <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` The geographics of this increase are very significant,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, director of the state Office of Infectious Disease. `` We're seeing syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases where we've never seen them before. `` They used to be reported only in the larger metro areas. Now it's the rural areas that are reporting the majority of the increase.'' <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> reported 2,614 cases of syphilis in 1986, 2,656 in 1987 and 4,436 last year. The increase has been 125 percent for black women and 53 percent for black men, compared with a 37 percent increase for white women and a 7 percent decline among white men. Officials attribute the decrease to AIDS education. In the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> health district, syphilis cases have more than doubled, from 232 in 1987, when crack cocaine arrived, to almost 500 this year. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Shierling </PERSON>, one of six state epidemiologists who interview syphilis victims in 14 southwestern counties, said there are `` little girls out on the street every night having sex numerous times just for cocaine.'' `` A lot of times girls do n't have money, so they use the next best thing. They trade their bodies for drugs,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Moultrie-Colquitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squad </ORGANIZATION>. Shierling, who interviews infected people and tries to contact their sex partners, said that where three to four contacts in six months once was normal, investigators now are lucky to get two names because clients have had too many to remember or are reluctant to discuss matters that involve illegal drugs. `` We have very little success in interviewing the street girls,'' he said. Women, ranging from their teens to their 30s, may have sex with five or six men to buy one $ 20 `` rock'' of crack, said an <ORGANIZATION> Albany-Dougherty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` It's one of the highest highs that most of these junkies have ever had. But it's over very quickly. Then they immediately need more, so it's a vicious cycle.'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, health director for the <LOCATION> Waycross </LOCATION> district, said his 16 counties had 50 to 60 cases of syphilis a year through 1984. But in 1987, 201 cases were reported and last year there were 255. Officials agree that increased use of cocaine seems to be a major factor, and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> has begun a three-month study in the <LOCATION> Waycross </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Valdosta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> areas to substantiate the link between syphilis and drugs. People who test positive for syphilis also will be tested anonymously for the AIDS virus and for drug use. Blood samples will be sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>'s crime lab for testing. `` There's a definite system to it,'' <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> said. `` Whether in <LOCATION> Waycross </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, drug dealers settle in low-income housing projects where they get young females hooked on crack or coke. `` To support their habits, these women may sell or trade sex with as many as 20 partners a day, without ever knowing who they are. When they ca n't remember the names of these sexual contacts, epidemiologists ca n't find the contacts so they go untreated and, more likely than not, infect someone else.'' Untreated sexually transmitted diseases increase the risk of infection with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus, which can enter the body through breaks in the skin, such as the chancres that can form on the penis, vagina, tongue and lips of those infected with syphilis. `` The current emphasis on AIDS testing and education has created a drain on staff and funds,'' Ms. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said. `` Yet it is extremely important that we do so because syphilis is known to increase the risk of contracting the AIDS virus threefold.''

<HEAD>More May Suffer From Sting Allergies Than Thought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRIS CHANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five to 10 times more people may be allergic to insect stings than previously thought, according to a new study. `` It's amazing how many people have suffered from this and never told their doctors about it,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, one of the researchers who tested 269 people and studied their medical histories. Past studies showed that only about one in 200 people have a history of dangerous or fatal allergic reactions to stings, but the new study showed the figure is closer to three or four in 100, said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON>, who led the research published in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. At least 50 Americans a year die from severe allergic reactions to insect stings, and their death is the first sign of their allergy, he said. Typically, people stung by bees, wasps or ants will have a local reaction, a small swelling. A more severe case would be a large local reaction, swelling a patch of skin. But a `` systemic'' allergic reaction affects the entire body. It can mean either swelling all over the body, shortness of breath, or a drop in blood pressure, or all three, and can result in serious illness or death. In the study, 269 factory workers were given skin tests with bee and yellow jacket venom, and filled out questionnaires on their allergic histories. Fifteen percent of those who reported no history of allergic reactions reacted positively to the skin test. `` That is of special interest since most fatal sting reactions occur in individuals who had never experienced an allergic sting reaction,'' the researchers wrote. The researchers also took blood to check for allergy-causing antibodies. More than 26 percent of the workers showed the potential to develop a systemic allergy. Each of those 70 had a 20 percent chance of developing a dangerous or fatal systemic reaction to an insect bit, <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON> said. He urged people who have had severe reactions to enter venom immunotherapy, in which small doses of venom are injected into the bloodstream to build up the patient's immunity. The treatment is almost 100 percent effective, <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> said. Nine out of 10 patients who suffer from systemic reactions do not realize they are in life-threatening danger, he said. `` They get up from a serious reaction and think its a fluke and that it will never happen again.''

 Consumer prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in June, the smallest advance since early last year, the government said in a report that bolstered the view that inflationary pressures are beginning to ease. The slowdown reported Wednesday in the Consumer Price Index reflected the fact that energy and food costs, which had been shooting upward this year, finally moderated last month. Stock prices responded to the upbeat news with a strong rally that carried the market to new highs since the crash of October 1987. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 39.65 points to 2,584.41.

 Housing starts, led by a steep rise in apartment building, rebounded 7 percent in June as interest rates fell, the government reported. But analysts said Wednesday that single-family construction would remain weak as the economy continues to slow.

<HEAD>World Bank Makes Billion-Dollar Profit; Cuts Loan Fee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> says it met its goal of a billion-dollar profit in its latest fiscal year, allowing it to cut a loan fee and resume a suspended aid program for the world's poorest countries A top bank official also repeated Wednesday that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is first in line for a new <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> debt-reduction program, followed by <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Debt reduction for those nations depends on their reaching agreements with commercial bank creditors, said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for finance. `` That's more or less a complete list. That does n't mean others will not follow in the next six months,'' he said at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> press conference. Borrowers will save about $ 200 million a year under a cut announced Wednesday in the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment fee, which is charged to borrowers on the portion of authorized loans they have not yet received, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. The bank will resume contributing $ 100 million of its profit to a program that makes `` soft'' loans to the very poorest countries, which are generally not able to make interest payments, spokesman <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> said. In a switch, this year's contribution will go for debt reduction, the bank said. The annual contribution was suspended last year when the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> needed to devote its profit to building up the reserves backing its loans. Loans to the poorest countries through the bank's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> are stretched out over 40 years and carry an interest rate of less than 1 percent. Most of the IDA's roughly $ 5 billion in annual lending comes from government contributions. The Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said its profit in the fiscal year ended June 30 totaled $ 1.094 billion, up from $ 1.004 billion a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has made a profit of $ 1 billion a year each of the last five years. It plows the money back into further lending. The organization was founded in 1945 to make loans to developing countries and has 151 member countries. After several years of being low on reserves, the bank built its reserve-to-loan ratio to 10.2 percent last year, within its target range of 10 percent to 11 percent. The bank revealed Wednesday that its board had adopted a financial management system in February that will reduce the risk from wide swings in currency exchange rates. By the end of June 1990, borrowers will be required to make loan payments with a fixed combination of currencies, about evenly split between dollars, Japanese yen and West German marks. The fixed ratio will make it easier for borrowers to plan their repayments, the bank said. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said the bank will try to match the mix of currencies in its loan portfolio with the mix of currencies in its reserves. In the last few years the dollar's decline shrank the size of its reserves in comparison to its loans, which were heavy in other currencies. In its annual income statement, the bank said its return on assets came to 1.09 percent, up from 0.98 percent the year before. The bank said it borrowed $ 9.3 billion in 17 currencies last year, at an average cost of 7.73 percent and an average life of 7.8 years. Although government-supported, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> gets about 90 percent of its funding for loans from private investors.

Most computers still use 5 \ - inch diskettes, although the 3 -LCB- - inch format Packaged software is not available on the Japanese-made 2-inch diskettes, but users will be able to load programs into the portable by hooking it up to another computer or a device that handles bigger diskettes. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirapaul </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION>, Ill.-based company is not counting on the tiny diskettes to become a new industry standard, although that may happen because they hold as much information in less space.

<TEXT>
 A bipartisan group of senators has introduced legislation to allow disabled Americans receiving Social Security disability benefits to return to the workforce without losing their medical coverage. Chief sponsor Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., said Wednesday that many recipients of Social Security Disability Insurance currently avoid returning to work because they lose their benefits, including Medicare coverage, if they earn more than $ 300 a month after a trial work period Under the legislation, disabled people who returned to work would remain eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, and some would pay for the coverage on a sliding fee scale linked to their earnings. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> is unavailable to these individuals at any price. `` Those people who want to work should have the opportunity to do so,'' <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said. `` A disabled person should not be punished by taking away much needed medical benefits.'' The legislation, whose chief co-sponsor is <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, would cover about 4 million disabled workers nationwide. A similar bill has been introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. Costs of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation have been estimated at $ 120 million over five years, but that does not take into effect the contributions to the economy that would be made by those who went back to work. The bill is a followup to legislation enacted last session that extended similar work incentives to recipients of Supplemental Security Income, a separate program that provides a minimal income floor to the nation's aged, disabled and blind.

<HEAD>Yeutter Expects to Propose 1990 Farm Bill by Year's End</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he expects to have specific proposals for the 1990 farm bill to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by the end of the year. He indicated Wednesday that his proposals would have a strong emphasis on international concerns and would continue the market-oriented concepts of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations. `` As we develop this legislation, we must do so realizing that we are operating in a global marketplace,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is in the beginning stages of hearings toward formulating a new farm bill. The legislation will set <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural policy for several years. It will also include a vast array of programs ranging from dairy price supports to crop programs for wheat, feed grains, rice, soybeans, cotton and sugar. Besides the big-ticket commodity programs, the 1990 bill will include other features that were built into the Food Security Act of 1985, which will expire next year. The law also includes credit programs operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, rural development, extension and research. The bill also will include provisions for operating <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s food stamp program, which serves more than 20 million Americans annually, and a number of other child and nutrition programs. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> lauded provisios of the 1985 law that enabled <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to reduce the relatively high price support levels of previous years. That had the effect of lowering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crop prices and make them more competitive on the world market. When asked by Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., when he would present his proposals to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he did n't know, but added, `` Probably before the end of the year. In his opening statement, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said government policy makers `` have to be responsive to changing supply demands ... and marketing opportunities.'' He said current policies toward soybean and oat production indicate `` we are not committed to competing.'' He said consumer demand for oat bran as a preventative against heart disease and other ailments has created a market for oats both domestically and internationally that government policy has not caught up with. `` We could be producing oats for the American market and exporting them, if we had anything to sell,'' he said. He also said the government has `` never thought globally'' about dairy products. `` It's a new world out there,'' he said. He called for a budget commitment to research and development, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not be on the leading edge of world agriculture otherwise. He pointed out a potential demand for agricultural products for uses other than food, saying the debate over clean air could lead to a call for ethanol-powered vehicles. The government should prepare farmers for that demand by developing appropriate farm programs, he said. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who was the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, re-emphasized his frequently voiced concern about international trade negotiations and their effect on the farm bill. `` It would be foolish indeed if we wrote our farm bill oblivious to what is happening'' in other countries, he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to get other countries to drop or seriously reduce their subsidies on exports, but those talks, known as the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, will not be complete before the 1990 farm bill is written.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> can not adequately enforce federal antitrust laws because of budget cuts that have reduced funding and staffing, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> panel said in a report. The 15-member panel's report, released Wednesday, also called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials to end `` rhetoric'' that some existing antitrust laws are outdated and should n't be enforced. `` ... the task force members uniformly believe that the antitrust division's core mission _ to preserve competitive markets _ can not be carried out at the current reduced levels of staffing and resources,'' says the 59-page report. The report was submitted to the bar association's antitrust section and was not considered as representing the position of the section or the association. It was released in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Scher </PERSON>, chairman of the bar association's antitrust section, which monitors and recommends changes in antitrust law. <PERSON> Scher </PERSON> said copies of the report were sent to Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and the recently appointed antitrust division head, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rill </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> antitrust section was likely to approve the report and refer it to the full association, <PERSON> Scher </PERSON> said. Asked for his reaction to the report, <PERSON> Rill </PERSON> said, `` On balance, it's positive. `` It confirms the enforcement priorities of the division _ criminal enforcement and merger enforcement,'' <PERSON> Rill </PERSON> said. He said the report `` makes some useful suggestions regarding structural and competition analysis that can be brought into play in deregulation and still somewhat regulated industries.'' While <PERSON> Rill </PERSON> said the report `` probably is a bit off the mark in suggesting that the merger guidelines have not been fully enforced,'' he said, `` it does represent a public perception'' that the antitrust division has not enforced those guidelines. Noting his brief tenure, <PERSON> Rill </PERSON> said he has not made any final assessment as to whether the division has enough manpower and money to do its job. The division has about 500 people, he said, including 230 attorneys and 40 economists. Under 1982 and 1984 modifications in federal antitrust laws, many constraints against mergers in a range of industries were eased as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration endorsed allowing market forces to regulate competition. `` Although it was important to highlight the excesses of prior enforcement policies and substantive antitrust doctrines, the task force believes that further reliance on this rhetoric will undermine self-policing and voluntary compliance with the law,'' the panel stated. It added that `` diminished support for antitrust enforcement has allowed the talent and other resources of the division to shrink, as its mission was lost in the ` non-action' enforcement rhetoric of the times.'' Panel member <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, a former assistant attorney general for antitrust, disagreed with the contention that criticism of exisiting laws had undercut enforcement policies. He and various other panel members also dissented from several key criticisms contained in the report. The panel said that under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's deregulatory philosophy enforcement of actions other than bid-rigging and price-fixing have become `` extremely rare. It said that during the 1980s, when merger activity skyrocketed, antitrust division resources devoted to merger enforcement actions declined and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> allowed a significant number of mergers it did not statistically define as competitive. While supporting overall changes in antitrust laws, the panel recommended a `` more vigorous and visible merger enforcement program'' and said antitrust laws should not be relaxed further. It also called for more criminal price-fixing investigations. In pressing for increased funding, the group said the antitrust division staff had been reduced by 50 percent in the last eight years and many of its most experienced lawyers had left. It said support for antitrust division lawyers appeared to be at an `` all-time low.'' The panel included three former assistant attorneys general in charge of the antitrust division, former senior staff members, private antitrust attorneys, scholars and economists. <PERSON> Rill </PERSON> said some of the report's criticism `` is misdirected. The suggestion that the division is using some set of standards other than the merger guidelines simply is n't the case.'' <PERSON> Rill </PERSON> rejected the report's contention that criminal enforcement of antitrust laws had been aimed mostly at small companies instead of regional or national ones.

<HEAD>Contract Costs Mean Loss for Northrop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 78.1 million in its second quarter despite an earnings increase because of additional costs it must bear on secret research and development contracts, the defense contractor reported. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that sales were $ 1.4 billion for the quarter, up 4 percent from the same period in 1988. However, the firm had a net loss of $ 78.1 million compared with a profit of $ 21.9 million, or 47 cents a share, for the 1988 period. The loss was caused by $ 150 million in estimated additional costs to complete a classified long-term, fixed-price contract. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> said the contract was unrelated to its B-2 stealth bomber program, which has suffered cost overruns. For the first half of 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> had a net loss of $ 68.4 million on virtually flat sales of $ 2.68 billion, compared with a profit of $ 161.5 million, or $ 3.44 per share, for the same period last year.

 <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said that despite flat sales, its profit rose 11 percent to $ 178.1 million in the third quarter of its 1989 fiscal year compared with a year earlier. The aerospace, automotive, electronics and graphics firm reported earnings Wednesday of 70 cents a share for the period ended June 30. That compared with a profit of $ 214.7 million, or 82 cents a share, for the third quarter of 1988. The 1988 figure included a one-time favorable tax adjustment of $ 50.2 million. Sales for the 1989 third quarter were $ 3.2 billion, compared with $ 3.1 billion for the 1988 period. Profit for the first nine months of fiscal 1989 totaled $ 608.8 million, or $ 2.37 a share, compared with $ 626 million, or $ 2.34 a share, for the 1988 period. The fiscal 1989 earnings included $ 100 million from the sale of a division. Nine-month sales for 1989 were $ 9.2 billion, up from $ 8.8 billion in 1988.

<HEAD>New Fashion Magazine Settles Down to Hard Work of Making It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The glittering coming-out party for <PERSON> Mirabella </PERSON>, the new women's <ORGANIZATION> fashion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, is history. The upbeat reviews have been written, and the gossip columnists have turned their attention elsewhere. Now begins the waiting game. Will the upscale fashion and lifestyle guide for the well-educated woman be a lasting hit? Or will it join the heap of new magazines that fold after only a few years? `` It's going very well. I think wonderfully well,'' <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirabella </PERSON>, the monthly's editor and namesake, said Wednesday. All 600,000 copies of the premier issue in June sold out, she said. But this veteran of the competitive, crowded world of magazines knows success can be fleeting. `` I'm anxiety-ridden,'' she says. And the sales figures for the July issue _ 70 to 75 percent of 600,000 copies are expected to sell _ could be interpreted as cautionary. But <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewit-Nirenberg </PERSON>, the magazine's publisher, noted that summer is traditionally a slow time in the magazine business and that the first issue sold for $ 1 compared to the hefty $ 2.95 that the buyer must now fork out. She also said the number of advertising pages dropped from 123 in June to 85 in July and 50 in August. But the picture is rosy for the September issue, which just closed for printing with 149 advertising pages, she added. Ms. <PERSON> Mirabella </PERSON> described the pitfalls to avoid if the magazine is to succeed. `` We have to keep our eye on the reader we think we have _ where her head is and how she sees us. The reader we have is an intelligent reader, selective in her view and selective in her eye.'' By targeting a narrowly defined audience of well-educated, older and affluent women, <PERSON> Mirabella </PERSON> has a chance of surviving in the crowded fashion magazine market, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostrow </PERSON>, worldwide media director of <PERSON> Foote </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belding </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ad agency. But a good six months will have to pass before any meaningful judgment can be made on the publication, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, senior vice president of media services at <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, another <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ad agency. `` <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirabella </PERSON> is a well-known personality. And the launching of the magazine was very gossiping and jet-setting,'' she noted. `` Once that dies out, then you are going to see what you are dealing with. It's still too early to tell.'' Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the money and backing of communications magnate <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> bode well for <PERSON> Mirabella </PERSON>, as does the fact that Ms. <PERSON> Mirabella </PERSON> is the creative force behind it. `` She is an extremely talented woman who has demonstrated her strength before. I would be very optimistic about the long-term success.'' Ms. <PERSON> Mirabella </PERSON> was editor in chief of <LOCATION> Vogue </LOCATION> for 17 years before she was abruptly dismissed in June 1988 by S.I. <PERSON> Newhouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the head of magazine publisher <PERSON> Conde </PERSON> <PERSON> Nast </PERSON>. In November, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> approached her about presiding over a monthly bearing her name. In six months Ms. <PERSON> Mirabella </PERSON> not only assembled a staff but produced a new magazine. Despite its goals, the glossy, oversized publication has some features that can hardly be considered intelligent reading material. One article in the June issue lists the favorite lipstick color of actress <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, designer <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> and jewelry designer <PERSON> Paloma </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>. But its tone is more subtle than many other fashion magazines _ both in its fashion coverage and its features. And Ms. <PERSON> Mirabella </PERSON> and her staff pride themselves on the fact that the monthly is almost half text. `` It's a smart and intelligent magazine for women interested in style and fashion but like a little more protein in reading matter, not just a sugar high,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lewit-Nirenberg </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to order up to 100 new jets in a $ 2.8 billion deal signifies its ailing carriers, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, expect improved financial conditions, analysts say. Analysts said Wednesday the deal was an important one for Eastern, now in the midst of bankruptcy reorganiztion and a lingering strike, but said both <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries probably are speculating on better times before the start of deliveries in 1992. `` Each of them, along with a couple of other carriers in the industry, have been facing some financial difficulty,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, president of Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an aviation consulting firm. `` But with the first delivery in 1992 they could be betting on the fact that they will have improved significantly in their financial performance by that time and be able to arrange some good financing,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> said. Sixty of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> jets are earmarked for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and 40 for Eastern. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> also announced Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> soon would purchase 11 widebody Airbus A300 jets and spare parts from Eastern for $ 303.5 million. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> plans to lease two <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-10s from Eastern and in return lease 34 of its jets to its sister carrier. `` I think this is an important step in <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s return to profitability and confidence in the future of the airline,'' said <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Corr </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer. `` Overall, we're looking at more seats to more destinations than prior to these changes.'' <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy as many as 60 of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s narrow-body 737-300s, with deliveries of 30 aircraft planned for 1992 to 1994 and with an option to purchase another 30 of the jets in 1995 and 1996. The total cost of the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> purchase would be about $ 1.7 billion, <PERSON> Corr </PERSON> said, adding that about three-quarters of the new fleet would replace aging aircraft. <PERSON> Corr </PERSON> declined to discuss financing for the purchase. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> posted a first-quarter loss of $ 16.5 million, narrowed from an $ 80.6 million loss in the same quarter of 1988. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said it would obtain financing for the planes `` in later years, nearer to the delivery dates, based on prevailing capital market conditions and projections.'' Airline analyst <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, of Philadelphia-based <PERSON> Janney </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, said the airlines' competitive position in the 1990s strongly depended on orders for new jets. `` The biggest difference we find right now between the haves and the have-nots in the industry is the airplanes on order,'' he said. `` It may sound like a trite thing to say, but when you're spelling out the differences that will exist between these two groups, the share of market these airlines hold in the future ... is going to directly hinge on the size of their fleets,'' he <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, a non-union carrier that emerged from bankruptcy reorganization in 1986, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> were among only three major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines that did not have new planes on order. Troubled <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is now the only one in that category. The agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> allows <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to substitute a portion of its order for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s 737-400s or 737-500s, which have different seating capacities, allowing for greater flexibility as the airline's needs change in the coming years, <PERSON> Corr </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> can fine its member brokers who engage in securities fraud but the government can not, a situation the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> wants to change. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Wednesday that under current law, his agency can impose fines only in a few instances, mostly for insider trading. But several self-regulating organizations overseen by his agency, including the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, have more authority to fine their members than the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> does, he added. `` And this legislation would remedy that disparity,'' said <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>. The chairman said the proposal to widen the scope of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to seek fines would give it and the courts more flexibility to fit the penalty to the crime, take away much of the financial incentive for white collar crooks, discourage repeat offenders from breaking the rules again, and help the government recoup some of the money spent enforcing the law On another matter, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> told reporters after the hearing that he's still `` waiting around'' for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to name his successor. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, who announced plans in May to return to teaching law at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said that despite the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's inaction, `` I have n't made up my mind when I will leave. On the proposed legislation, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Enforcement Director <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> explained that a change was needed because `` for all practical purposes, our fining authority is limited to insider trading.'' A 1988 law allows the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to seek civil fines of as much as three times the amount of illegal profits from those who trade illegally on confidential information. But in other <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> civil actions for stock manipulation or securities fraud `` there's no ability for a court to impose a fine,'' said <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>. He noted that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is empowered to seek restitution, called disgorgement, of illegal profits _ but not fines, which are now only possible after criminal convictions. But criminal cases must be brought by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>, noted that in fiscal 1988, `` only 25 of the 252 enforcement cases initiated by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> primarilly involved insider trading. For most other civil violations, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has only two alternatives: seeking an injunction against further violations or suspending a Wall Street firm's broker-dealer's license, which <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> termed `` the regulatory death penalty.'' <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who is stepping down later this month after more than a dozen years with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, said that censure is not enough punishment in many cases but suspending a broker-dealer's license `` even for one day'' would be going too far. If one section of a large, multiservice firm violated securities law `` it's not going to be appropriate to take actions that would affect the entire firm _ not to mention that it would hurt the customers as well, leaving their accounts frozen for the day. It really is n't a viable alternative,'' said <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>. The new legislation also would empower the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to seek, either through an administrative proceeding or court order, a bar against security law violators serving as officers or directors of any SEC-registered company. Outside the meeting room, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, who previously said he would stay on at the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> until a successor was named, said `` I suppose the final means of forcing some action would be for me to leave,'' although he has not set a deadline for himself. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> also said that no successor has been selected yet for <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who was repeatedly praised by subcommittee members at the hearing. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who played a central role in breaking a series of insider trading cases including stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and investment banking giant <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he would decide `` within the next couple of days'' where he will work after leaving the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Chrysler: Trucks 'R' Us</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the time being, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> says, the nation's No 3 automaker is more of a truckmaker than a carmaker. `` If you call minivans trucks, it looks that way because in the last 40 days in total, we've sold one car for every truck,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said in an interview this week. `` Other companies are n't quite in that position,'' he said, `` but that's just because of -LRB- Jeep -RRB- Cherokee strength and minivan strength.'' Auto industry analysts say the struggling company's emphasis on the profitable Jeeps and minivans may be the best tonic. `` Right now, it's a truckmaker that also makes cars,'' said auto analyst <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` I think it's an intelligent decision on <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s part because trucks make more money that cars.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is expected to announce Monday that its second-quarter earnings were near or slightly lower than those during the same time last year. This time around, the company will be relying more on the dollars generated by trucks than in the past. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, through its Dodge Caravan and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION>, holds 56 percent of the minivan market in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It pioneered the popular vehicles back in 1983 and has held most of the market since. Through the first half of this year _ and for the first time in history _ <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> sold more domestically made light trucks than cars. Together, those vehicles make up more than 90 percent of the company's fleet. Trough June 30 this year, the company sold 0.97 cars for each truck. A year ago at the same time, the ratio was 1.14 cars per truck. The gap was wider in the first half of 1987, as the company sold 1.56 cars per truck. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales have run slightly more than twice the rate of its truck sales, and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sells better than 1.5 cars for every truck. Despite the dominance of truck sales at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said the company is very much in the carmaking business. `` We ca n't become just a truck company,'' he said. `` We've got good car programs. First of all, our luxury cars are in pretty good shape because they're not too big. `` Then we have an all new platform coming in late'92,'' he said. `` That's a billion-dollar effort at a new mid-size group of cars and they're coming along nicely. `` The one that's tough is we do n't have an -LRB- Dodge -RRB- Omni replacement at the moment. Our smallest car really is the P-car, the <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> Sundance-Dodge Shadow.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is n't letting today's truck business take care of tomorrow. There will be more competition in the segment beginning in the next few months as the new <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> minivans come to the market and as foreign companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, introduce more versions. A growing number of companies also are offering sport-utility vehicles like <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s Jeep line. But <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is n't standing still. The company has broken ground for a new assembly plant in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> that will make a Jeep model code-named the `` ZJ.'' Earlier this year, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> announced that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and the French automaker <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> would join forces to make a smaller sport-utility vehicle named the `` JJ.'' Both of those products are to be introduced in the early 1990s and mean the company will have more truck production capacity than it does now. Anyone watching <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s profits knows the company these days is making money from minivans and Jeeps. `` People look at the car side and wonder if they are at a competitive disadvantage to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>,'' said analyst <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` That's hopefully just a temporary condition. `` But clearly, now you can make an excellent case if you want to classify it as a truckmaker,'' he said. `` Over the next couple of years, you'd have to say the show belongs mostly to the truck side of the operation.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, maintaining its board has the right to decide the company's long-term strategy, has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to uphold a lower court decision allowing the media giant to proceed with its $ 14 billion tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Time made the request in a brief filed Wednesday with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, two days after <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> asked the court to overturn the ruling by <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and block the planned <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger Paramount is trying to buy Time in a hostile $ 12.2 billion tender offer. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> ruled last week the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger resulted from <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term business strategy and that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, who are also trying to stop the merger, had not proved they possessed a right to interfere with the transaction. Paramount claimed in its brief that <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s decision would allow <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> to proceed although the merger _ and <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term strategy _ would cost <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders the financial benefits of the $ 200-a-share Paramount bid. Time responded that the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> itself noted, in a 1985 case involving <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and takeover strategist <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, that `` there is substantial evidence that director resistance to hostile bids, even at a premium over market price, tends in the long run to enhance market prices.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> also has stated that `` ` a board of directors is not a passive instrumentality' even in matters of fundamental corporate change,'' and that directors are allowed and even obligated to take steps to protect shareholder interests in the face of a tender offer, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> contended. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s highest court will hear the case Monday, and the justices could rule at any time after arguments are concluded. Time's $ 70-a-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to expire at 5 p.m. Monday. Paramount charged in its brief that <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> used improperly used standards for director actions set in the Unocal case, but <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> said the judge's decision was `` unquestionably the product of an orderly and logical deductive process.'' Time said further there was support for the board's actions in a case arising from the takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last year. The case allowed a board to use several criteria in refusing to entertain offers that threaten corporate policy, including a firm's long-term plans, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> said Nothing in the <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> decision `` suggests that these criteria _ particularly ` long-term strategic' plans _ become inoperative in the face of an all-cash, all-shares tender offer,'' Time said. Time stock closed up $ 1.37 -LCB- a share to close at $ 139.37 -LCB- in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at $ 65.62 -LCB- a share, and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> picked up $ 1.62 -LCB- to close at $ 58.62 -LCB- a share. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday its second-quarter earnings rose 12 percent to $ 94 million, or $ 1.61 per share, up from $ 84 million, or $ 1.45 a share, in the same period of 1988. Revenue for the period rose to $ 1.22 billion from $ 1.1 billion. Time said in a statement all of its business segments _ magazines, books, programming and cable television _ had improved results during the quarter. For the first half, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> had it earned $ 143 million, or $ 2.49 a share, down from $ 150 million, or $ 2.58 a share, in the first six months of 1988. The first-half results were affected by Time's lower first-quarter profits, which fell due to lower operating earnings from the company's magazine segment, heavier interest expenses and costs related to the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> deal. First-half revenue totaled $ 2.35 billion, up from $ 2.17 billion a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> announced its earnings on Tuesday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> resumed contract talks with both sides digging in their heels on the key issue of benefits for retired miners. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> stated flatly Wednesday that the company wo n't take part in the `` union-sponsored health and retirement funds. Period.'' The company's attempt to withdraw from the union's industrywide pension and health care plans in favor of a program for <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> employees has been a main issue in the 3 -LCB- - month-old strike The union fears that if <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> pulls out of the plan, other employers will too. `` We've given everything we have to give,'' <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said at company headquarters in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Give us a proposal that displays this -LRB- union -RRB- flexibility.'' <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>'s statement was `` basically another demonstration of bad faith,'' <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> has never said it is unable to afford any proposal the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> has offered including the pension plans, <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said. The two sides met for the first time in six weeks at a motel in this southwest <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> town. They sat in separate rooms with federal mediators shuttling notes back and forth. Talks were to resume today. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> refuses to rescind what the company calls its final offer, which the union rejected last month. `` They want us to be flexible but they do n't want to be,'' union spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said earlier Wednesday on `` CBS This Morning'' that the company was standing by its previous contract proposal. `` At this point the movement will have to come from the union,'' <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said. `` We have our proposal on the table. The 1950 UMW retirement fund covers 130,000 pensioners who retired between 1947 and 1976. It was established so miners who went from company to company when mines shut down could have pensions, <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>, which has 560 retirees covered by the fund, said it does n't make sense for the company to contribute to pensions received by retirees of other companies. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said the union would n't give in on the issue. The UMW wo n't `` turn our backs on 130,000 pensioners,'' he said. Later, <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> told a rally of about 3,000 union members and supporters in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> plans to increase pressure on directors of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of the coal company. Union officials said that pressure will be demonstrated today with a visit by <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> to the region. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has threatened to pull city funds out of <ORGANIZATION> Shawmut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> unless <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s board who is connected to the bank, resigns his board seat. About 1,900 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> went on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> beginning April 5, because of the company's refusal to sign a national contract outlawing mandatory overtime and Sunday work, in addition to the retirement benefits issue. Up to 46,000 miners in 10 states had been off the job until Monday in wildcat strikes to support <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> workers. Most have gone back to work but the union said up to 40 percent of the 7,900 union miners in south-central and southwestern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> remained on strike Wednesday. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, contract administrator for seven <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> Districts, said he expected all to return to work by today.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Against Yen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen Thursday, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s main index rose moderately. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 107.70 points, or 0.32 percent, ending the day's trading at 33,664.87. The index had gained 213.44 points Wednesday. The dollar ended at 142.23 yen, up 0.43 yen from Wednesday's 141.80-yen close Opening higher at 142.80 yen, the currency gradually moved downward, ranging between 142.05 yen and 142.90 yen. The currency started higher in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> following an overnight rise in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> despite a lower-than-expected consumer price index figure released Wednesday, said <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> reported the nation's index for June rose by 0.2 percentage point, compared with a 0.6-percentage point increase in May. The small increase in the index indicates a slowdown in the economy, meaning inflationary pressure is easing. `` It seems that market players bought the dollar regardless of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic fundamentals,'' <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> said. Indicators showing a slowdown in the economy normally discourage investors from buying the currency. `` Concerns over the upcoming election have made the yen less attractive, but many investors seem to be buying the dollar not because they are avoiding the yen temporarily but because they think it's still profitable to invest in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency,'' he said. Many believe that the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will lose badly in the parliamentary election scheduled for Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> has been hurt by an influence-peddling scandal, an unpopular sales tax and Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s alleged relationships with paid mistresses. On the stock exchange, the index rose moderately during the morning session and kept the gains though trading slowed in the afternoon, dealers said. Afternoon trading was directionless, said a dealer with a major securities firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said many market players remained on the sidelines ahead of Sunday's polls. Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 500 million shares, up from Wednesday's 330 million. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> announced that it suspended trading of the shares of <ORGANIZATION> Iseki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturer of farm machinery, from 1:00 p.m. to the closing of the day at 3:00 p.m. The price of <ORGANIZATION> Iseki </ORGANIZATION> plunged 34 points and more than 2 million selling orders were filed due to a rumor about the company's capital reduction, said a TSE official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The TSE suspended transactions in the firm's stock to check the rumor, which was later denied by company officials, he said.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new 620-room casino hotel is on the drawing board for <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company already burdened with massive debt. When entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> purchased Resorts International last November, he inherited the obligation to develop <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Uptown Urban Renewal Tract, long a desolate site just a few blocks away from the Resorts casino. Earlier this week, Resorts officials submitted plans to the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> for the 56-acre plot. A 60,000-square-foot casino with a 32-story hotel tower and 2,860-space parking garage will take up about 14 acres, according to the designs. Resorts also outlined plans for the rest of the tract, including a shopping center and parking spaces. The plans were submitted several weeks after Resorts quietly announced it hired the <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> investment banking firm to help it refinance its enormous corporate debt. Resorts has more than $ 900 million in long-term debt, including $ 200 million in mortgage bonds and $ 125 million in notes that <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> sold to finance his takeover of the company from developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. Gaming analyst <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that Resorts' plans for the renewal tract `` are all pie in the sky.'' `` This company is going to have to restructure, period. The sooner, the better,'' he said. `` There is no way in the world that any sane person would lend this company any more money. Everyone on Wall Street is against them.'' <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said that Resorts management also needs to prove it can run a casino without losing market share. The gaming hall's market share has declined in the past year. Resorts officials said they do not plan to build or finance the proposed casino hotel, estimated to cost $ 262 million. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, Resorts' chief of staff, said the company is looking for a third party to finance the project. Resorts had already received two extensions on a deadline to submit its proposals to the housing authority, but was denied another extension request. Resorts is now obligated to take title to the land from the housing authority by September for the first phase of the project, which includes the shopping center, said authority director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McAvaddy </PERSON>. Construction must begin 90 days after the land is acquired, he said. The second phase of the proposal, which focuses on the casino, must be acquired by next April, he said. The authority realizes Resorts' financial predicament, <PERSON> McAvaddy </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` That is the reason they are seeking a joint venture partner, because the financial picture indicates there might be a problem in financing the development in-house,'' he said. Resorts may be viewed with skepticism when it does start developing the renewal tract. In 1976, Resorts bought development rights to the tract for $ 5.6 million and promised to build at least 1,200 housing units and an accompanying shopping center. But the acreage bounced along with the changing owners of Resorts. Under Resorts founder <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>, the development was stalled by litigation from a prior developer and state claims. When <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> died in 1986, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought the gaming hall and unveiled plans for a complex that would have been like a city within a city. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> purchased Resorts from Trump last year. The new proposal explores transferring the housing obligation from the urban renewal tract to other Resorts property in the city. <PERSON> McAvaddy </PERSON> said the housing authority is willing to discuss that possibility. `` If they do build housing within the tract, it would probably be upper-middle or luxury housing, and it would not meet the demands to serve the people we're aiming it for,'' he said. Even the proposed shopping center might be better placed, <PERSON> McAvaddy </PERSON> said, perhaps closer to new housing developments in the city's inlet section. Resorts has the option of modifying its plans in the next few months, he said, until the time when preliminary construction plans are due.

 The rich, the famous and the beautiful love to summer on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard. So does everyone else. But this year, locals who feared their idyllic island was being overrun by tourists are complaining of a summer spending slump. The <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Vineyard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> blames a weakening economy that has depressed tourism across <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and a tougher ferry policy for cars adopted in an effort to control traffic. `` Things are off regionally,'' the chamber's executive director, <PERSON> Angeljean </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiaramida </PERSON>, said Wednesday. `` They're off for us a little more because of the perception that people are not going to be able to get here.'' Receipts at local hotels, restaurants and stores are down at least 20 percent and for some merchants as much as 40 percent, said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomassian </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Martha </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vineyard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Many hotels post vacancy signs even on Saturday night. Reservations are not essential at elegant seaside restaurants where old money and new talent rub shoulders. The real estate market is sluggish, and some private homes were not rented this summer. After area residents complained of endless traffic jams, the <ORGANIZATION> Steamship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> agreed to stop guaranteeing passage to autos without reservations. Though 99 percent stand-by motorists are ferried across within a day, merchants say the lack of a guarantee deters many travelers. `` I think word has filtered out, ` Forget going to the Vineyard unless you made your reservation a year ago because you ca n't possibly get your car over,''' <PERSON> Tomassian </PERSON> said A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Steamship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said the number of passengers and cars ferried to the island from Jan. 1 to July 4 actually increased slightly compared with last year. `` I could speculate and say that while we're carrying people we do n't search them and check them to see how much they're going to spend,'' spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` Maybe people traveling these days have a tighter budget once they get off the vessel.'' Conservationists, however, welcome a season of sanity after a decade of unrelenting growth. `` The business people are never satisfied,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krantz </PERSON>, head of the <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Vineyard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` They'd like to have every road filled with people and all the cars and all the stuff that makes life miserable. Celebrities are certainly not deserting the resort. Already this summer islanders have spotted the likes of <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sills </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Akroyd </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Reston </PERSON>. Year-round residents include <PERSON> Carly </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, actress <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> and heirs to the Spalding, Corning Glass and <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> fortunes. The slump is bad news for year-round Vineyard residents, who must earn the bulk of their annual income in 100 summer days, <PERSON> Chiaramida </PERSON> said. It is also bad news for the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bluffs </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> and Vineyard Haven, which depend on a 4 percent hotel tax to stay afloat, she said. According to <LOCATION> Tomassian </LOCATION>, the slump has renewed tensions between workaday islanders who thrive on tourists and well-to-do summer folk who fear their T-shirt shops will overrun the island. `` I'm afraid that things have become so polarized,'' she said. `` You are either an environmentalist or you are pro-development and pro-business. Maybe this -LRB- slump will -RRB- ... make people realize that what's needed is a happy medium.''

 Business-trip costs can send corporate travel managers through the roof, but a big accounting firm says its new computer software package can help put employees on the road for less. New York-based Price Waterhouse is marketing Air Auditor, an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> personal computer compatible software program that keeps track of the schedules and air fares offered by domestic airlines. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, manager of Price Waterhouse's <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, says the $ 1,500-Air Auditor package can be used to plan an employee's itinerary or confirm the lowest fare. The software also can control future travel costs when information on the company's travel policies are stored in Air Auditor's database. Class of service, connecting flights, ground transporation, airline preference and other information can be evaluated by the software to give a company the lowest possible cost for any travel itinerary, <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> said. Although in use only a few months, Air Auditor is getting good reviews. `` I think it's doing fine,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON>, operations manager of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> company headquartered in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` It is another tool for us to keep corporate travel costs down.'' Price Waterhouse estimates <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations spent about $ 100 billion last year on travel and entertainment, with about 40 percent on air tickets alone. The accounting firm hopes confusion caused by daily changes in airline fares will increase demand for software it says could reduce corporate travel costs by as much as 25 percent. Under development for three years, Air Auditor originally was created by <ORGANIZATION> Airplan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a small <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> software firm. Price Waterhouse worked with the company to refine the program before <PERSON> Airplan </PERSON> was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> One </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an airline reservation system owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Let's say you're flying from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and you want to leave around 5 p.m. Air Auditor will show what flights and fares are available and rank those flights and fares to how well they meet company travel policy,'' <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> said. `` It is the same information a travel agent would look at. The computer deciphers it for you so you do n't have to be a trained travel agent to use it.'' Miles said corporate ignorance has created problems selling the software. `` Most companies are like we once were,'' he said. `` They do n't know how much is being spent on travel, so they do n't know what can be saved. Price Waterhouse estimated three years ago it was spending $ 35 million a year on travel but later discovered the actual cost exceeded $ 42 million. Part of the reason, <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> said, was `` we had a hundred different offices using 500 different travel agencies.'' He said the company instituted a travel policy that used only one travel agent and required `` the lowest logical fare,'' forcing employees to travel economy class. But the company also put a value on the traveler's time. `` We wo n't look for a cheap fare that would have the traveler spending three hours in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> waiting for a connection,'' he said. `` This year we hope to reduce travel expenses by $ 6 million to $ 7 million.'' Travel agents are n't offended having their customers looking over their shoulders with Air Auditor. `` These systems are developed to meet a need,'' said <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` Corporations are asking for more information about fares.'' Ms. <PERSON> Maxson </PERSON> said it's common for agents to be questioned about why they did n't take advantage of a special promotion. `` A lot of corporate travel officers do n't read the fine print,'' she said. `` The program will help them wade through all the restrictions.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communiciations </ORGANIZATION> spends about $ 25 million on corporate travel. `` It does n't exclude us from using other means of reducing travel costs,'' she said. `` It is just another tool.'' She said that in checking fares through Air Auditor, the company has discovered only a few instances where the travel agent failed to find the cheapest fare. But she said the software is still useful. `` I do n't know if we will ever get to the point of not using it,'' she said. `` It is an ongoing tool to verify that our employees are getting the lowest fares.'' Air Auditor also is used by some airport authorities to determine whether the fares offered by airlines are competitive with other airports within driving distance. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, says he wants to ensure that fares offered by airlines serving <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>'s airport are competitive to those offered in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` When prices get out of line, we contact the airlines and tell them we noted that fares might be higher in a particular market,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, who worries about competition from the airports in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We ask for explanation, and if it is not satisfactory ask that they be lowered.''

<HEAD>Brunswick to Cut 4,000 Jobs Nationwide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it will cut the jobs of 4,000 workers _ about 20 percent of its employees _ from its troubled marine operations because of a sharp drop in demand for pleasure boats and engines. Workers will be laid off at more than 30 plants in 28 states, <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday, announcing an expected 75 percent plunge in second-quarter earnings from record results of $ 68.3 million, or 78 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. The biggest cuts will be at the Skokie-based company's largest facility, a Mercury Marine engine plant in <LOCATION> Fond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, where 300 workers will be let go, the company said. About 300 were laid off there earlier this year. Projections for the quarter would mark it as the second consecutive period of sinking profits at <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> because of problems in the marine group, comprised of <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ray </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and Mercury Powerboat divisions. Profits dived 68 percent in the first quarter to $ 17 million. At the time, the company blamed higher costs of materials, and industry observers cited assembly problems and the practice of selling boats and engines as a unit rather than separately. Chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichert </PERSON> said the slumping consumer demand in the second quarter was `` virtually unprecedented'' after record sales in the first quarter. Given the buildup in dealer inventories and the end of the normal selling season, the company said it ca n't predict when and at what level there might be callbacks of laid-off workers. Layoffs are to take place over the next two months. <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION>'s rival, suburban Waukegan-based <ORGANIZATION> Outboard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, also reported dismal results at the beginning of the month. It projected a 50 percent drop in its third-quarter earnings, blaming its results on decreased demand.

<HEAD>Report on Employment in EEC Shows Surprising Rise in Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s first annual report on employment in the 12-nation trade bloc released Thursday showed a rise of 2.5 million jobs since 1987 instead of a predicted drop of 500,000. EEC Commissioner for Social Affairs, <PERSON> Vasso </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, said that forecasts made by the <PERSON> Cecchini </PERSON> report on the impact of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to create a single, borderless market by Dec. 31, 1992 had been `` wrong. But Ms. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said `` despite the improvements there is still a problem of underemployment'' in the Community. She added that opportunities to find jobs vary substantially from area to area and that employers were slow to recognize that the quality of products in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> was `` linked with the quality of the labor market.'' The report showed that the rate of employment in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> _ that is, the number of people who have a job divided by the number of people of working age _ had dropped to less than 60 percent from 64 percent 20 years ago Ms. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said this was `` substantially below that in other industrialized parts of the world, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Scandinavian countries'' where the employment rate is over 70 percent. The report is to be used to set employment policy guidelines and was written, according to Ms. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, in clear and simple language so that it would be `` widely read by all those concerned with employment at national, regional and local levels in the member states.''

<TEXT>
 A Japanese toymaker said today it will stop selling a black inflatable doll with big round eyes and a grass skirt, but the company denied it was acting because critics called the doll racist. <PERSON> Shusuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubota </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Takara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said it also was discontinuing the use of the doll, named `` Dakko-chan,'' as its corporate symbol. Takara, which also makes `` Transformer'' robots that can be bent and twisted into other objects, is the second Japanese company in less than 10 days to say it is abandoning symbols that critics have called derogatory to blacks. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Calpis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it was discontinuing a 65-year-old trademark portraying a top-hatted black man sipping a drink through a straw because some customers had found it objectionable. But <PERSON> Kubota </PERSON> said <PERSON> Takara </PERSON>'s decision to discontinue `` Dakko-chan'' had no connection with racial issues. `` It's not a black. It represents a Japanese child whose skin has darkened from being out in the sun all summer long,'' he said. Takara has sold 2.4 million of the round-faced dolls, which can cling to an arm or leg and wink as they move, since they were introduced in 1960 and became a big hit, <PERSON> Kubota </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Takara </PERSON> had been planning to eliminate the doll for some time but did n't have a hit product to replace it with. That changed with the recent worldwide success of its `` Flower Rock'' toys, <PERSON> Kubota </PERSON> said. The toy consists of a fake flower that wears sunglasses and moves in its pot when music is played nearby. The new toy has been popular among adults as well as children, <PERSON> Kubota </PERSON> said. The mass-circulation newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Takara </PERSON> apparently was concerned that criticism of the black doll in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might hurt `` Flower Rock'' sales. In August 1988, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> criticized <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for mannequins and dolls which the caucus said stereotyped and degraded blacks by exaggerating their physical features. A department store in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> removed two black mannequins with distorted features, including huge lips, and <ORGANIZATION> Sanrio </ORGANIZATION>, a major gift manufacturer, stopped producing three dolls with black features. In October, <ORGANIZATION> Kanebo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> stopped making a brand of chewing gum bearing a face with big round eyes and big lips after receiving a protest from the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-apartheid group. In January, a Japanese publisher said it would no longer publish `` Little Black Sambo'' books, one of the best-selling children's books in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for more than 30 years, because of racist connotations <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has only about 50,000 non-Asian foreign residents among its 120 million population.

<HEAD>July Soybeans Plummet In Contract's Final Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for July delivery of soybeans plummeting on its final day of trading. The July soybean contract, which is at the center of a dispute over a possible market-cornering attempt _ was off 35 -LCB- cents at $ 6.92 a bushel in the first hour of trading. The contract expires at noon Central time. Analysts said thin trading conditions have made the July contract extremely volatile. Traders have been exiting the July soybean market since July 12, following the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency order requiring them to limit their holdings in the July contract. Some said it appeared that the Italian grain concern <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziaria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.p.A. </ORGANIZATION>, the reputed target of the exchange's unusual order, was switching its large position in the July contract into the August contract, possibly setting up another confrontation with the exchange. `` I would n't be surprised if that were probably the case but I have no knowledge that that is the case,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 2 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.87 -RCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 -RCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.52 a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 1.43 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 8 cents to 35 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 6.92 a bushel. Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .08 cent higher with August at 72.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchnaged to .23 cent higher with August at 83.95 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .42 cent higher with July at 48.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .50 cent to 1.20 cents higher with July at 30.05 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled mixed on Wednesday while pork futures were mostly higher.

<TEXT>
 A federal bankruptcy judge today approved the release of $ 75 million cash from escrow to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which the strikebound carrier's creditors indicated should help meet the company's financial needs through the end of the quarter. The Miami-based airline initially had asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> for the release of $ 100 million from its creditors, while a committee representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> creditors asked for only $ 40 million to be released. However, the parties agreed to the $ 75 million figure and the judge approved it, with the understanding Eastern could request additional funds in the future. Eastern was expected to file a plan for reorganizing with the bankruptcy court by the end of the week. Separately, published reports indicated <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was prepared to sell Latin American routes and most of its terminal space to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> because of continuing difficulties in contract negotiations with its striking pilots' union. A memo from Eastern senior vice president <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the route sale idea would be scrapped if the company reached a contract agreement with the pilots, according to today's editions of The <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said the company would not comment on the report. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, spokesman for American, said the Dallas-based airline has `` done no deals with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' but added: `` We are an acquirer. If any airline has assets it wants to sell, we'll look at them.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s rebuilding is moving along well. They said a measure of their confidence was evident in their announcement of the aircraft purchase. Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> will acquire $ 2.8 billion worth of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-300 aircraft. The order includes 50 firm purchases and options to buy 50 more of the jets. Sixty of the jets were earmarked for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, another <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, and 40 for Eastern. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> also announced a number of other aircraft transactions involving <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern. He said the transactions demonstrate confidence that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> will be a thriving operation in the 1990s. The company is in the midst of a rebuilding program launched during the 4-month-old strike by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members, pilots and flight attendants. `` We've arrived at the point where we're able to make a major acquisition of this type,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, called the aircraft purchase a `` joke.'' `` It's nothing but a stunt to draw attention away from the fact that Eastern is falling apart,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and Bakes announced the aircraft purchase at a news conference at a downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hotel On the street outside, about 20 strikers picketed in protest of <LOCATION> Lorenzo </LOCATION>. The two Eastern officials acknowledged that the August expansion of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s flight schedule will not be as big as originally announced. But they maintained that the smaller expansion is not a sign that the rebuilding program is failing. Bakes said too much attention is being paid to the actual number of flights Eastern will have in its August expansion. The airline originally promised to have 390 flights a day by Aug. 1, but it said this week some reductions may be necessary. Before the strike March 4, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had about 1,100 daily flights. It now has 220. Bakes refused to say exactly how many flights will be on the schedule in August. But, he said, the airline is refusing to take bookings on flights for which crew training is incomplete. Bakes said the company has made progress in revenue, hours flown and passengers carried. He insisted that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has enough money from the sale of assets to persevere through the rebuilding period, though he would not respond when asked how much money the airline was losing each day. The appearance by <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and Bakes in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> followed reports that negotiations between the company and the pilots union had broken down. The officials refused to discuss specifics of the talks but said they were not making progress. `` I ca n't be here bubbling with optimism about where they -LRB- the talks -RRB- are going,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> also dismissed a plan by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> as a `` public relations attempt.'' <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, who has been trying to buy Eastern in alliance with its unions, said Tuesday he is close to securing a `` highly confident'' letter from his financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In the letter, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> says it would agree to raise $ 280 million in debt financing for the Eastern bid, <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> told The Wall Street Journal. <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, owner of a commodities trading firm, also said he has been talking with the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> about an additional $ 200 million for an employee stock ownership plan.

 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday reported a 15 percent gain in second-quarter earnings from operations it still owns, but a 1 percent drop when including its discontinued refining interests The company said favorable tax claims and more carloads of higher-priced commodities helped offset a rise in fuel prices and a slowdown in grain and aggregate carloads for its <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb.-based railroad.

 Investors who believed they could get rich selling T-shirts and bumper stickers were bilked of up to $ 30 million by the company that made the printing equipment, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was ordered to temporarily stop making promises about its `` sublicolor'' system, which actually consists of old-fashioned mimeograph machines that were sold for $ 10,000 each. A federal judge also ordered <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>'s assets frozen while the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> tries to recoup money believed to have been lost by people from all 50 states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The company's scam cheated `` somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000 people, multiplied by a minimum of $ 10,000 each,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>. `` We estimated up to $ 30 million in court papers.'' Case Equipment's owner, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casella </PERSON>, said this morning that his equipment works as advertised. He said customers who made no money using it probably were just not cut out to be in business for themselves. <PERSON> Casella </PERSON> said he had sold about 3,800 of the machines. `` We sell to an awful lot of people who have never been in business before, and they think the equipment is going to make them a millionaire, and that's not true,'' <PERSON> Casella </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. `` People make themselves millionaires.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> last week asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to issue a temporary restraining order against <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said from her <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> office that <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> lawyers plan to return to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Friday to seek a preliminary injunction that would halt the allegedly fraudulent sales until the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>'s civil lawsuit against the company is resolved. `` It's OK if he sells the equipment,'' she said. `` He just has to tell the truth about it. We're seeking restitution for customers, which is plenty. There's your $ 20 million to $ 30 million.'' Case Equipment is also named in a separate lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in which customers from several states say they were bilked. They are asking for compensatory and punitive damages. Case Equipment has operated in Turner since 1984. Prior to that <PERSON> Casella </PERSON>, also known as A.J. <PERSON> Casella </PERSON> and A.J. Case, abandoned a similar operation in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> when that state's attorney general's office began investigating complaints, Ms. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. She said potential investors were lured to <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> by national magazine advertisements, flown into <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jetport </LOCATION> and picked up in limousines that took them to <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>'s showroom in Turner. They were shown impressive samples of printing and given a sales pitch that said making money with the `` sublicolor'' system would be easy, and that Case Equipment had service centers around the country and long lists of potential customers, Ms. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. The customers' living expenses were paid during their visits. `` It's a wine'em and dine'em sort of operation, and the people are impressed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. `` Even people who had some knowledge of the printing industry were taken in. They have told customers stories about how a 15-year-old could use it. They said anyone can use it.'' But once people bought the Case Equipment machinery, they were ignored and given little training in using it, <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> documents say. The machinery could not be operated by untrained workers and produced sloppy printing without regular maintenance, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said. The company falsely claimed to have service centers all over the nation, when it had none, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Consumers not only lose their initial $ 10,000-plus investment, they spend significant additional sums and valuable time in vain trying to get the equipment to function,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said. The commission accuses Case Equipment of cheating `` mostly working people looking to start or expand their own small business ventures. However, the only ones to profit have been Case and <PERSON> Casella </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Casella </PERSON> said the companies that make and distribute his equipment provide numerous service centers. He said his company provides food and lodging to potential customers to make sure they come see what they are buying. He said he insists buyers attend training sessions and sign a form saying they are trained in the use of the sublicolor and satisfied with its performance.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said today the central bank has been pushing down interest rates in an effort to keep the country out of a recession and acknowledged the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s best efforts might not be enough. After a year of raising interest rates to dampen inflationary pressures, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> switched course in June and began lowering rates because of widespread signs of a weakening economy. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, making his midyear report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, indicated that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> stood ready to lower rates further, but he said its best efforts might not be enough to stave off an economic downturn. `` Some day, some event will end the extraordinary string of economic advances that has prevailed since late 1982,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said in testimony before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> banking subcommittee. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman said it was entirely possible that some <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policy mistake could trigger a new recession despite the agency's best efforts to keep the current record peacetime recovery going. Elsewhere on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration praised the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to drive down interest rates. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, told the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the central bank had acted prudently and had avoided `` any major policy mistakes.'' He declined to say whether it should lower interest rates further to avoid a recession, saying, `` I do n't like to preach to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in public.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is committed to doing its utmost to ensure prosperity and rising standards of living over the long run,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. `` We do, however, face a difficult balancing act.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> must weigh the dangers of a recession against the risk that too loose a monetary policy could spark a new inflationary spiral in the country. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s policies would be oriented toward avoiding `` an unnecessary and destructive recession.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman's comments indicated that the central bank was likely to continue its policy of gradually lowering interest rates over the coming months. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> first began easing credit conditions in early June and eased again in early July. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s remarks were the first official indication that the central bank had indeed reversed its year-long tightening efforts, although there was a widespread belief in financial markets that this was occurring. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> released a revised economic forecast which showed that the central bank still hopes to achieve a so-called soft landing in which growth will slow enough to cool inflationary pressures but not decline so much that the country is thrown into a recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> forecast that the overall economy would grow at an annual rate of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent. This was lower than the administration's revised forecast on Tuesday that the economy would grow at a 2.7 percent rate this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> today forecast a 2.4 percent rate of growth this year, slowing to 2 percent in 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> saw more dangers from higher inflation, forecasting that consumer prices would rise by between 5 percent and 5.5 percent this year, up from last year's 4.4 percent increase. The administration is less concerned about an uptick in inflation, forecasting that consumer prices would rise 4.9 percent this year. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> estimated consumer price inflation and interest rates will be about half a percentage point higher both this year and in 1989 than the administration forecast Tuesday. It predicted civilian unemployment will rise from its current 5.3 percent to average 5.5 percent in 1990. `` The recent slowing in economic growth will not go so far as to turn into a recession during the next several months,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reischauer </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reischauer </PERSON> estimated the chances of the economy slipping into a recession during the next nine months was `` in the 15 percent to 40 percent range.'' In setting preliminary monetary growth targets, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had decided to leave the growth rates unchanged for this year and next year as well. For M-2, the measure of the money supply which includes currency in circulation and interest-bearing checking accounts, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said it would aim for an increase of between 3 percent and 7 percent both this year and in 1990. The central bank is charged with the primary task of guarding against inflation by controlling how fast the money supply increases. The goal is to supply enough money to support healthy growth while making sure that inflation is not re-ignited by pumping too much money into the system. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s actions influence the cost of money _ interest rates. With the decision in early June to ease credit conditions, a variety of business and consumer interest rates have been falling and economists are predicting that the current <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> easing course will mean further declines in banks' prime lending rate and in mortgage rates over the next several months. Recent inflation figures look favorable. On Wednesday, the government reported consumer prices edged up just 0.2 percent in June, the smallest advance in 16 months. That followed news last week that prices at the wholesale level actually fell last month. Before the June slowdown, consumer prices were shooting up at the fastest pace since 1982. But economists believe the worst is now over for energy price increases, caused by the clampdown on production by oil exporting countries, and in food costs, which were driven up by last summer's drought.

<HEAD>Allied-Signal Reports Rise in Second-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 30 percent rise in second-quarter earnings, reflecting strength in the company's aerospace sector. For the three-month period ended June 30, the advanced technology company said its net income totaled $ 166 million, or $ 1.11 per share, compared with $ 128 million, or 85 cents a share, in the same 1988 period. Included in 1989 second-quarter results was a one-time gain of $ 23 million, or 16 cents a share, stemming from an insurance settlement awarded to <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in which Allied has a 40 percent equity interest. Excluding the one-time gain, <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION>'s net income for the quarter was $ 143 million, or 95 cents a share, up 12 percent. Sales for the second quarter edged up to $ 3.1 billion from $ 3 billion in the 1988 period, Allied said. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said the company's strong performance was aided by the improved showing of the company's operating units, particularly its aerospace sector. `` Earnings are expected to remain strong through the second half of 1989 as we continue to concentrate on improving our operating performance,'' <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION> is an advanced technology company with businesses in aerospace, automotive products and engineered material. For the first half of 1989, the company's earnings grew 22 percent to $ 292 million, or $ 1.96 a share, compared with $ 240 million, or $ 1.60 a share, in the first half of 1988. Revenue in the first half totaled $ 6.06 billion, nearly unchanged from $ 6.04 billion in the year-earlier period.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its second-quarter earnings declined nearly 14 percent, reflecting an arbitrator's decision that <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> owed money to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and because of weakness in its aerospace division. The diversified company said it had income of $ 59.3 million, or 67 cents per share, compared with $ 68.9 million, or 78 cents per share, in the 1988 quarter. Revenue was $ 1.85 billion, compared with $ 1.79 billion a year earlier. Earnings were depressed by an arbitrator's ruling that <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> owed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> $ 9.5 million under an agreement to jointly produce helicopters, said company spokesman <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had paid for materials in 1978, but they had not been shipped before <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> was prohibited by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government from providing any further supplies to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, he said The aerospace division's earnings decreased nearly $ 2.5 million, primarily because of increased costs on fixed-price development programs for the V-22 Osprey and on some rocket and smart-bomb systems, <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> said. That was offset by an increase of almost $ 10 million in earnings for financial services. <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> also recorded a $ 14 million increase in interest expense, mostly from its acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Avdel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British fastener manufacturer. <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> has been unable to complete the acquisition and absorb the earnings, however, because of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> opposition. <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> has interests in a number of industries including aerospace technology, commercial products and financial services.

<HEAD>Earnings of Nation's Big Three Likely To Fall Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Big Three automakers' earnings roll is slowing down. After setting earnings records in three of the last four quarters, analysts expect <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will announce second-quarter earnings slightly lower than a year ago, reflecting a softening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car and truck market. But, they add, it's no time to panic. `` I do n't think there's that much importance that's going to be placed on earnings comparisons with last year,'' said auto analyst <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Earnings last year were exceptionally strong, and this year all we've heard about is weakness,'' he said. The Big Three's roll of quarterly earnings records began in the second quarter last year when the companies reported earnings of $ 3.49 billion, or $ 7.14 a share. That was followed by a record third-quarter report of $ 1.83 billion and a record fourth quarter in which the companies made $ 3 billion. The Big Three earned $ 3.54 billion in the first quarter of this year, second only to the record of $ 3.87 billion posted in the first quarter of 1984. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> tentatively have scheduled their earnings reports for the middle of next week and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s is due July 31. Surveys of analysts' predictions show <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> will report second-quarter earnings around $ 2.17 a share, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> will show a per-share profit of about $ 3.10, and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will have a profit of $ 1.50 a share. Those estimates compare with second-quarter, per-share earnings last year of $ 2.26 for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, $ 3.43 for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and $ 1.45 for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. The industry began to soften early this year. Car and truck sales for the Big Three during the first half of the year were down 6.5 percent from last year. `` What's more important is the level of profitability the Big Three will demonstrate given this weak setting,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. Some observers say the market is saturated by the 80 million or so new cars that have been sold during the last five years. The automobile industry also has been hit by expectations of slower economic growth, fluctuations in interest rates and consumer indifference to recent sales incentives. That compares robust sales in the industry and a more stable overall economy at the same time last year. Incentives a year ago also sparked consumer demand, making it easier for automakers to get rid of inventories that can drag down earnings. Incentives, though, can be a wild card in an automaker's earnings since they come directly out of profits. If not careful, an automaker can find itself in a vicious circle. Higher sales increase profits while incentives lower them. In an effort to boost sales, the companies have increased incentives, and that's costly. Analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirnan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> estimated that the Big Three spent about $ 600 per car in incentives during the first quarter and boosted that to $ 800 to $ 850 per car in the second quarter. `` I think the crunch time is coming,'' he said. Analyst <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> said the Big Three are facing a twofold problem. `` The primary problem is unprecedented incentives compounded by the recent strength in the dollar which has improved import competitiveness and reduced the dollar value of overseas earnings,'' he said. The profits that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> have posted in recent quarters have been buoyed strongly by their European automotive operations. While they've made money in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> recently, earnings have been stronger in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. European income has little effect on earnings of the much-smaller <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. While the Big Three are likely to report slightly lower earnings in the second quarter, some analysts said the financial community is looking more toward the third-quarter results, which will be reported in October. `` In general, my sense is there are going to be a lot of earnings cuts coming after the release of these -LRB- second-quarter -RRB- numbers,'' <PERSON> Kirnan </PERSON> said. `` I think a lot of people have delayed making major adjustments in their earnings estimates because they want to see how things fared in the second quarter _ how heavy were the incentive costs.''

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Close Higher, Corn and Soybeans Dip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat futures prices closed higher while corn and soybean futures finished mostly lower Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, where attention was focused on the expiration of the July soybean contract. Trading in soybeans for July delivery ended at 12:01 p.m. central time after a spurt of selling that pushed the contract's price down to $ 6.88 -LCB- a bushel, 39 cents below Wednesday's settlement price. Analysts said thin trading conditions made the July soybean contract extremely volatile. Traders had been exiting that market since July 11, when the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> issued an emergency order requiring them to limit their holdings in the July contract. Some said it appeared that the Italian grain concern <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziaria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.p.A. </ORGANIZATION>, the reputed target of the exchange's unusual order, had switched its large July position into the August contract, possibly setting up another confrontation with the exchange. Trading companies believed to be representing <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> were large sellers in the minutes before the July contract expired, traders said. The wheat market gained support from expectations of new export business and perceptions that the market has reached its seasonal bottom, said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The corn and soybean markets were pressured by rain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> in addition to the pronounced weakness in the expiring July contracts. July wheat expired -RCB- cent higher at $ 3.90 -RCB- a bushel; July corn expired 6 -RCB- cents lower at $ 2.47 -LCB- a bushel; July oats expired 3 cents lower at $ 1.43 -LCB- a bushel. At the close, other wheat contracts were 3 cents to 7 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 3.90 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 2 \ cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with September at $ 2.39 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 3 cents lower with September at $ 1.51 \ a bushel; soybeans were 6 -LCB- cents lower to 4 -RCB- cents higher with August at $ 6.81 a

<HEAD>Schlumberger Reports Decline In Second-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its second-quarter profit declined 12 percent in the second quarter, partly reflecting a decline in oil rig activity and oil-price uncertainty. For the three months ended June 30, the oil exploration company had after-tax earnings of $ 127 million, or 53 cents a share, down from $ 144 million, or 53 cents a share, in the 1988 period. Operating revenue totaled $ 1.20 billion, down 5 percent from $ 1.26 billion in the comparable 1988 period. <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said earnings-per-share remained unchanged in the quarter because of fewer shares outstanding as a result of the company buying 34.5 million shares in 1988 for $ 1.2 billion. The quarterly results included one-time gains of $ 13 million, or 5 cents a share, from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> businesses and $ 22 million, or 9 cents a share, from an award by the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal. In the previous year, the compnay has a one-time $ 35 million increase in from the sale of a division. The company's oil field services revenue was 3 percent lower as crude prices continued to decline from April levels. For the first six months of the year, the New York-based energy concern had net income of $ 209 million, or 88 cents a share, down 14.7 percent from $ 245 million, or 90 cents a share, in the 1988 period. Operating revenue was $ 2.4 billion, down 5 percent from $ 2.5 billion in the same year-ago period.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it has approved a $ 25.5 million sale of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> talk radio station WOR-AM to Buckley-WOR <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Under the FCC-approved settlement, the seller, <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, would receive only 65 percent of the proceeds, with the remainder going to six other applicants who had challenged the fitness of RKO and its parent, <ORGANIZATION> GenCorp </ORGANIZATION>. of <LOCATION> Fairlawn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, to hold the WOR license. The other applicants were: <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, whose principals include broadcaster <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Trell </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> and TV-radio personality <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> COZZIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, which numbers comedian-actor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> among its stockholders; S-G Communications of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, in a 2-1 decision on July 14 that was released Thursday, said <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION>'s license renewal application would be dismissed and RKO will transfer the station to S-G Communications. S-G will transfer the license to an RKO subsidiary, GRADH-107, which in turn will transfer the license to <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> upon consummation of the settlement. The <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> will pay RKO $ 24 million, of which <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 7.425 million to the other applicants. <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> also will pay $ 1.5 million, in addition to the $ 24 million, directly to principals of the competing applicants. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said `` RKO's receipt of less than full market value for the station would serve as an effective deterrent against license misconduct.'' The sale was the latest step in the FCC-ordered dismantling of the RKO network, which began in the 1960s when challenges were filed to RKO's fitness to operate its stations. In a 1980 ruling that stripped RKO of one TV license, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> noted that <ORGANIZATION> GenCorp </ORGANIZATION>, the former <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had been accused of improper domestic political contributions and of bribery overseas. The FCC has approved similar sales agreements for <ORGANIZATION> WOR </ORGANIZATION>'s sister station, <ORGANIZATION> WRKS-FM </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 50 million; <ORGANIZATION> KHJ-TV </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> KRTH-AM-FM </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, $ 320 million and $ 86.6 million, respectively; plus WHBQ-AM, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>; WGMS-AM, <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md.; WGMS-FM, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; and WRKO-AM-FM, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bristol-Myers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday reported they had double-digit income growth in the second quarter despite suffering adverse consequences from the dollar's strength <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported its net income fell 22 percent despite a strong performance by its tobacco units. Bristol-Myers, maker of medicines, toiletries and household products, posted an 11.6 percent profit increase in the quarter ended June 30. After-tax income rose to $ 212.51 million, or 74 cents a share, from $ 190.48 million, or 66 cents a shares, in 1988's second quarter. Sales came to $ 1.53 billion vs. last year's $ 1.46 billion, an increase of about 5 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION>, a major manufacturer of consumer products ranging from soap to pet food, said its second-quarter net income increased 12.4 percent to $ 73.6 million, or $ 1.06 a share, from $ 65.5 million, or 96 cents a share, in the second 1988 quarter. Sales rose about 9 percent to $ 1.29 billion from $ 1.19 billion. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>, whose products include Lucky Strike cigarettes and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> alcoholic beverages, said its profit sank to $ 120.2 million, or $ 1.25 a share, from $ 154.7 million, or $ 1.57 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue edged up 0.1 percent to $ 2.722 billion, from $ 2.718 billion. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said its 1988 results included a $ 46 million gain from discontinued operations. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON>, Bristol-Myers' chairman, said international sales edged up just 1 percent while, domestically, sales were up 7 percent. Changes in the dollar's value against other major currencies during the quarter cut international sales by an estimated 6 percent, <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON> said. For the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Bristol-Myers </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 449.6 million, or $ 1.56 a share, up 12.1 percent from $ 401.1 million, or $ 1.39 a share, a year earlier. Sales amounted to $ 3.14 billion, up about 5 percent from $ 2.98 billion in the first six months of 1988. <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the financial improvement reflected continuing momentum in international operations and the <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s Pet Products division. The second-quarter earning included $ 6.5 million, or 9 cents a share, from the sale of land in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. This real estate gain partially offsetthe negative impact of a higher dollar. <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release that the dollar's strength, combined with economic difficulties in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and currency translation losses in other hyperinflationary countries, reduced second-quarter income by about $ 13 million, after taxes For the first six months of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 140.8 million, or $ 2.04 a share, up 7.6 percent from $ 130.9 million, or $ 1.91 a share, in the first half of 1988. Sales grew about 7 percent to $ 2.5 billion from $ 2.3 billion. Both Colgate-Palmolive and Bristol-Myers have their corporate headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Some of <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION>'s well-known brands include <ORGANIZATION> Ajax </ORGANIZATION> cleanser, Fab laundry detergent and Irish Spring soap. Among Bristol-Myers' brands are Bufferin and Excedrin pain relievers, Windex window cleaner and Drano drain de-clogger. For the first half of 1989, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> had net income of $ 292.4 million, or $ 3.05 a share, down 4 percent from $ 305.2 million, or $ 2.97 a share, in the comparable 1988 period. Revenue in the fist six months was $ 5.97 billion, up 2 percent from $ 5.8 billion in 1988. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Alley, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said tobacco operations were strong both at home and abroad despite a strong dollar, which makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products more expensive overseas. Domestically, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had record results in the quarter with operating income up 5 percent to $ 131 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s turnaround continued in the second quarter as earnings jumped 88 percent over the same 1988 period, the company said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> also reported a profit rise. The parent of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest bank, reported net income of $ 304 million, or $ 1.50 a share, in the quarter ending June 30, up from $ 162 million, or 85 cents a share, in the same period last year. <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> Chairman A.W. <PERSON> Clausen </PERSON> said in a statement the results reflected strength in key areas, including expansion of domestic loans and deposits, particularly in consumer loan and mortgage portfolios. Earnings for the first six months of 1989 were $ 579 million, or $ 2.88 per common share, up 114 percent from $ 271 million, or $ 1.41 per common share, in the same period last year. Two years ago, San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 955 million but bounced back in 1988 to report $ 726 million profit. <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION>'s net interest income for the second quarter totaled $ 1.03 billion, up from $ 806 million in the same 1988 period.

The bank's domestic nonperforming assets in real estate rose by about $ 195 million because of weakening in the industry.

 <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday weakness in its glass business and unfavorable currency exchange rates led to a 4.8 percent drop in second-quarter profit. The company earned $ 127.3 million, or $ 1.13 per share, in the second quarter compared with $ 133.8 million, or $ 1.22 per share, a year earlier. Sales for the comparable quarters edged higher by 2.7 percent from $ 1.45 billion to $ 1.49 billion. `` Despite the slowing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> economy, we are optimistic that 1989 will rank among PPG's best years for both sales and earnings,'' Chairman <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarni </PERSON> said in a statement. First-half net earnings totaled $ 257.1 million, or $ 2.28 per share, up 1.9 percent from $ 252.4 million, or $ 2.29 per share, a year earlier. Six-month sales rose 4.6 percent from $ 2.82 billion to $ 2.95 billion. PPG said it benefited in the second quarter from continued strong sales of fiber glass products and auto replacement glass. It was hurt, however, by high product development costs and softness in North American markets. New production capacity in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and European flat glass industry lowered sales volumes for some products, <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION> said. Sales of <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION>'s paints and other coatings were strong worldwide.

<HEAD>Multimedia Reports Higher Earnings in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Multimedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its second-quarter earnings rose 31 percent, spurred by the success of television programming such as the <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> shows. Revenues rose 6 percent overall, including gains in its newspaper, broadcasting, cable and entertainment divisions, the company said. Multimedia reported earnings of $ 10.8 million, or 87 cents a share, on revenues of $ 121 million for the quarter ending June 30. During the same period in 1988, the company earned $ 8.2 million, or 67 cents a share, on revenues of $ 114.3 million. Revenues from the entertainment division rose 21 percent, to $ 19.2 million, up from $ 15.8 million. The three other divisions each reported revenues increases of less than 10 percent. The broadcasting division accounted for $ 39.5 million of the company's second-quarter revenues. Newspapers brought in $ 35 million and cablevision $ 19.2 million. First-half earnings climbed 65 percent from $ 9.3 million, or 77 cents a share, to $ 15.4 million, or $ 1.24 a share. Revenues rose 6 percent in the first six months from $ 214.3 million to $ 227.3 million. `` The quarter and the first six months were as expected,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer. `` Newspapers were weak in retail advertising. Broadcasting was good, fortunately, because of our two major <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> properties in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. `` Cable was very strong and entertainment was very strong due to the continued success of <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> and the expansion of the <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> show to more markets and to an hour in length.'' The gain in first-half earnings was the result of higher revenue and less interest payments on a recapitalization project that began in 1985, <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said in a statement. Multimedia is a mediacommunications company that publishes 14 daily and 40 non-daily newspapers. It also owns and operates four television and seven radio stations, more than 100 cable franchises in four states and produces and syndicates television programming, including the <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> shows.

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government announced plans Thursday to sell to the public stakes in three state companies, including the country's leading commercial bank, as part of a long-term economic liberalization program. A government statement said <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Portugues </ORGANIZATION> do <ORGANIZATION> Atlantico </ORGANIZATION> will have 49 percent of its capital placed on the market. He said the state-run cement giant <ORGANIZATION> Cimpor </ORGANIZATION> and the Centralcer brewery will be partially privatized. Since election in July 1987, Prime Minister <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> has launched series of free-market measures to relax state control. The latest privatization plans follow the successful sale earlier this month of 49 percent of the government's shares in <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Totta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> e </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acores </ORGANIZATION>, a leading public bank, and April's partial privatization of the brewery <ORGANIZATION> UNICER </ORGANIZATION>. Like previous transactions, the sales revealed Thursday will be limited to 49 percent of company's capital. However, government spokesman <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Nogueira </PERSON> said new legislation slated to permit complete privatizations was being prepared, the Portuguese newsagency <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> reported. The government statement said <ORGANIZATION> BPA </ORGANIZATION> and Centralcer were likely to be fully privatized eventually, although the government would maintain a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Cimpor </ORGANIZATION> `` due to the nature of its activity and its importance in the national economy.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it will begin distributing its <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> within a month. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, said about 200 copies of the newspaper's international edition will be distributed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Sovaminco </PERSON>, a joint U.S.-Soviet venture.

 A sudden selloff near the close pushed stock prices lower Thursday, wiping out an early gain that carried the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average briefly past 2,600 for the first time since the fall of 1987. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 30 points at its midsession peak, closed with an 8.92 loss at 2,575.49. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 646 up, 871 down and 482 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 204.59 million shares, against 215.74 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 241.87 million shares. Analysts said the late decline stemmed in part from selling by professional traders engaged in computer program strategies involving options and index futures contracts, some of which expire after the close on Friday. They also said investors seemed to back away from an initially enthusiastic response to testimony by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s credit policies. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the central bank had taken note of a slowing in the pace of economic activity, and was seeking to avoid `` an unnecessary and destructive recession.'' However, he also noted that inflation remained clearly above where the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would like to see it. Brokers said <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s comments squared with the recent belief that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was proceeding gradually to try to steer the economy toward a `` soft landing'' that could set the stage for renewed growth.

<HEAD>Pork Belly Futures Soar On Signs Of Stronger Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Pork belly futures prices soared Thursday by as much as 2 cents a pound, the permitted daily limit on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, on signs that lower bacon prices may finally be stimulating demand for the sizeable supplies of pork bellies in cold storage. Hog futures prices also rose while cattle futures were mixed. On other markets, orange juice futures fell sharply for the fifth straight day; grains and soybeans finished mixed as the July contracts expired; precious metals erased some of Wednesday's losses; and energy futures advanced Frozen pork bellies settled 1.53 cents to 2 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at 30.55 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent lower to .98 cent higher with July at 49 cents a pound; live cattle were unchanged to .20 cent higher with August at 72.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .07 cent higher with August at 83.72 cents a pound. The pork-belly market turned in its strongest performance in more than six weeks in a delayed reponse to Tuesday's weekly exchange report on pork-belly stocks in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial freezers outside of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The report showed a net out-movement of nearly 5.4 million pounds last week compared to 3.9 million pounds for the same period a year ago. Supplies of frozen pork bellies, the part of the pig from which bacon is made, are at near-record levels. Stocks normally decline during the summer, due to a seasonal drop in hog slaughters, but reports since spring have failed to confirm the development of the trend this year. The slack demand has prompted grocers to sharply cut retail prices for bacon, which has been running 8 percent to 20 percent below last year for most of the summer, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` Maybe we're beginning to see that reflected in the demand,'' he said. A monthly <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report scheduled for release after the close on Friday is expected to again show near-record supplies of frozen bellies nationwide, but <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said the importance of that report to traders has been diminished. `` Their views are going to be tempered because of the recent out-movement'' reported on Tuesday, he said. Orange juice futures prices fell the 5-cents-a-pound daily limit on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on perceptions that large supplies of Brazilian juice will soon hit the market. Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 3.25 cents to 5 cents lower with September at $ 1.546 a pound. Wheat futures prices closed higher while corn and soybean futures finished mostly lower Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, where much attention was focused on the expiration of the July soybean contract. Trading in soybeans for July delivery ended at 12:01 p.m. Central time after a spurt of selling that pushed the contract's price down to $ 6.88 -LCB- a bushel, 39 cents below Wednesday's settlement Analysts said thin trading conditions made the July soybean contract extremely volatile. Traders had been exiting that market since July 11, when the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> issued an emergency order requiring them to limit their holdings in the July contract. July wheat expired -RCB- cent higher at $ 3.90 -RCB- a bushel; July corn expired 6 -RCB- cents lower at $ 2.47 -LCB- a bushel; July oats expired 3 cents lower at $ 1.43 -LCB- a bushel. Wheat settled 3 cents to 6 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 3.97 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with September at $ 2.40 a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 3 cents lower with September at $ 1.51 \ a bushel; soybeans were 6 \ cents lower to 4 -LCB- cents higher with August at $ 6.81 \ Gold and silver rebounded on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange in reaction to a weaker dollar, partially erasing Wednesday's losses. Gold settled $ 2.90 to $ 3.10 higher with August at $ 372.20 a troy ounce; silver was 1.4 cents to 2.8 cents higher with July at $ 5.181 a troy ounce. Energy futures prices advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a technically inspired rally following a sharp decline on Wednesday. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 23 cents higher with August at $ 19.90 a barrel; heating oil was .98 cent to 1.56 cents higher with August at 51.83 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .89 cent lower to .56 cent higher with August at 53.80 cents a gallon.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended July 10, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,119.1 billion from $ 3,101.6 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 4,008.0 billion from $ 3,992.3 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 778.7 billion from $ 777.4 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 2.6 percent, which is below the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3 percent to 7 percent. The annual growth rate in M3 is 4.3 percent, which is above the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,084.7 billion, a 1.5 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,967.4 billion, up 3.1 percent. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 562 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from $ 530 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 289.6 billion in the two-week period ended July 12, up from $ 289.5 billion two weeks earlier

 Wholesale home heating oil prices rose Thursday amid expectations of energy supply shortages overseas due to the labor and ethnic unrest in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Crude oil and unleaded gasoline futures were mixed. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, No. 2 heating oil for August delivery rose 1.46 cents to 51.83 cents a gallon, after falling 0.13 cent on Wednesday Contracts for heating oil delivery in more distant months also posted gains and the September contract rose 1.56 cents, settling at 52.57 cents a gallon. Among other refined products traded on the exchange, the August contract of unleaded gasoline declined 0.59 cent to 54.10 cents a gallon, adding to Wednesday's drop of 1.37 cents. Other unleaded gasoline contract months settled with moderate gains and losses, with the September contract falling 0.29 cent to 53.08 cents a gallon. West Texas Intermediate crude oil for August delivery settled 5 cents higher at $ 19.90 per 42-gallon barrel on the last trading day for that contract. The September contract for the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil rose 13 cents to $ 19.68 a barrel. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>, of the energy group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said continuing troubles in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> which have disrupted production in various industries `` is creating tight supplies in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> heating oil markets right now and that, in turn, is affecting our markets.''

He is trying to parlay the book-reading assignment into a new business _ using his status as a white-collar criminal to solicit corporations for a course or manual on business ethics. `` I am now extremely devoted to attempting to prevent others, because of unethical behavior, from placing themselves, their firms or society at large, at risk,'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, 42, says in his solicitation letter. <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, living in a rented condomimium in <LOCATION> Pluckemin </LOCATION>, would only say in an interview, `` It's behind me.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> took its emergency action in the soybean futures market last week after federal regulators took steps against a single concern, the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman testified Thursday. Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlman </PERSON> would not identify the `` major participant,'' believed to be Italian agribusiness giant <ORGANIZATION> Feruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, which took a massive position in July soybean futures. <PERSON> Mahlman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> board voted the emergency order, which required liquidation of large positions in the July bean futures market, after determining that only one board member, who was excused from the meeting and did not vote, owned or controlled positions in July soybeans. `` We hope our strong action in July will not be necessary in August,'' <PERSON> Mahlman </PERSON> told reporters after testifying before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. Although he conceded, under repeated questioning by Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, that several other board members were employed by companies that controlled or served customers that controlled soybean positions, <PERSON> Mahlman </PERSON> defended the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>'s action. Outside the hearing room, he said: `` I think we have dramatically enhanced the credibility of the board.'' <PERSON> Mahlman </PERSON> said eliminating all board members with employer links to futures positions would force about one-third of them to resign. <PERSON> Mahlman </PERSON>'s version of the emergency order differed from that given by federal regulators earlier this week. The hearings are being conducted on proposed legislation that would tighten anti-fraud rules and also reauthorize the agency that regulates futures markets, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In earlier testimony, the head of another <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchange said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should not ban the controversial practice of dual trading _ where brokers trade for themselves and their customers. Critics say dual trading allows brokers to take care of their own needs first, but banning it outright `` would be dangerous,'' said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee <PERSON> Mahlman </PERSON> concurred with that position. In a prepared statement submitted to the subcommittee, <PERSON> Mahlman </PERSON>, chairman of the world's oldest and largest futures exchange, also opposed a ban on dual trading, saying it `` will adversely affect the liquidity of futures markets, particularly agricultural markets, by increasing the cost of doing business. The <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency order last week, and federal regulators' reaction to the order was a hot topic during a subcommittee session on Tuesday <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> exasperated committee members Tuesday with her cautious answers to questions about the agency's consulting role in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> soybean situation Ms. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, who also said more study was needed before dual trading was banned, said her agency was reviewing the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency order but neither directly approved or disapproved the action Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., alluded to his frustration with the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> at the start of the second session when he said the congressmen present `` want to get complete answers instead of the ones they got Tuesday. The proposed bill, sponsored by English and the subcommittee's ranking Republican, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, would allow dual trading in only certain circumstances including futures that have an average daily trading volume of less than 7,000 contracts But <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> official, said dual trading was needed to maintain liquidity when there are few customer orders. He added that pegging dual trading permissibility to volume ignores the monthly idiosyncracies of various markets such as soybeans, cattle, oil or gold. On the other hand, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Josserand </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, advocated complete elimination of dual trading to restore public confidence.

<HEAD>Merck Earnings Up 25 Percent, Pfizer Down 36 Percent In 2nd Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its second quarter earnings rose 25 percent over the same period last year, while another drug maker, <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, posted a 36 percent drop in its second quarter net income <PERSON> Merck </PERSON>, which is based in <LOCATION> Rahway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, posted a profit of $ 396.6 million, or $ 1 per share, on sales of $ 1.6 billion in the three months ended June 30. That compared with a profit of $ 316.3 million, or 80 cents a share, on sales of $ 1.5 billion during the second quarter last year. Increased domestic and international sales of the drugs Mevacor, Vasotec, <PERSON> Primaxin </PERSON>, Pepcid, Zocor and Prinivil contributed to the company's strong second quarter showing, <PERSON> Merck </PERSON> said. `` Sales outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accounted for 47 percent of sales for the first six months, compared with 52 percent for the same period last year,'' said Dr. <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vagelos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Merck </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer For the first six months, <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION>'s net income rose to $ 737 million, or $ 1.86 a share, from $ 587.7 million, or $ 1.49 a share, a year earlier. First half revenue rose to $ 3.2 billion from $ 2.9 billion during the period. <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> posted a profit of $ 135.7 million, or 80 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $ 213.1 million, or $ 1.26 per share, in the second quarter of 1988. Quarterly revenue dipped to $ 1.3 billion from $ 1.34 billion. The New York-based company said sales declined in its health care business, reflecting worldwide sales drops in pharmaceuticals and hospital products, and agriculture operations. Sales rose for <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer products and materials science segments. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, said the stronger dollar also hurt sales. A stronger dollar makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products more expensive overseas. For the first six months of 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> had net income of $ 376.5 million, or $ 2.23 per share, down 13 percent from $ 432.9 million, or $ 2.57 per share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose to $ 2.7 billion from $ 2.6 billion a year earlier.

 <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, spurned in its effort to buy all of <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, offered Thursday to purchase Prime's minicomputer business for $ 450 million in cash and $ 150 million of MAI securities. Prime Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said its board of directors would meet to consider the offer. MAI stock fell 25 cents to close at $ 5.75 in consolidated trading Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Prime fell 12 -LCB- cents a share to $ 19. Minicomputer sales accounted for about a third of Prime's $ 1.6 billion in revenues last year. The remainder of its sales were from computer-aided design and manufacturing systems, Unix-based workstations, service and maintenance, and other operations. MAI, a <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, computer maker controlled by investor <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>, had pursued Prime for seven months before the Natick-based company agreed last month to a merger with J.H. <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> venture capital firm. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> has offered to pay $ 21.50 a share in cash for about 79 percent of Prime's common stock and to trade securities with a face value of $ 22 for each of the remaining shares. Wall Street analysts have valued the deal at about $ 1.25 billion. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>'s offer is scheduled to expire July 27. A spokesman for the venture capital firm said it still plans to acquire all of Prime.

 Fear that <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquitaine </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to buy <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.05 billion might unravel drove <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s stock down $ 7 a share to $ 120.50 Thursday <LOCATION> Elf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Acquitaine </LOCATION>, a French government-controlled energy and chemical company, said late Wednesday it had extended its $ 132-per-share offer for <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>, a Philadelphia-based chemical company, until Aug. 1 under pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>, expressing apparent antitrust worries, had threatened to seek a preliminary injunction to block the deal if <PERSON> Elf </PERSON> did not extend its offer, the company said. `` We felt we had no choice but to agree to extend,'' said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the company's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said it was concerned about two chemicals both companies produced. The companies and analysts said the government probably was fearful the deal would give <PERSON> Elf </PERSON> too much control of the market for the chemicals. `` I think people are getting nervous the deal is going to get stopped,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Cianci </PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` My gut feeling is the deal will get done in some modified form.'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, also said he doubts the deal will fall through. `` It's in their -LRB- Elf's -RRB- hand right now. All they have to do is divest a couple of small businesses,'' he said, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION>'s production of the two chemicals, polyvinylidene fluoride and its precursor, vinylidene fluoride Polyvinylidene, a plastic resin <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> sells under the brand name Kynar, is used to coat electrical wires and to line pipes in chemical plants and as a coating in buildings. Elf makes some products similar to <LOCATION> Kynar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kynar </PERSON> is one of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s major products, but the company would not release sales figures. It is made at plants in <LOCATION> Thorofare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Calvert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> management accepted the offer from <LOCATION> Elf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Acquitaine </LOCATION> in March The company, whose majority owner is the French government, outbid <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment group that <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> had spurned. Also Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> announced its second quarter earnings were more than double the earnings produced during the same period last year by divisions that were not sold during the fight with Centaur. Earnings from continuing operations were $ 20.66 million, or $ 2.57 per share, on sales of $ 148.67 million for the second three months of the year. During last year's second quarter, the company, minus the pharmaceutical and industrial equipment divisions that have since been sold, posted earnings of $ 10.18 million, or 80 cents per share, on sales of $ 130.82 million. <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said she could not comment on the earnings report or offer an explanation for the increase in profits. While fighting off <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover bid, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> bought back a large chunk of outstanding shares, partially explaining the increase in earnings per share. The discontinued operations represented $ 2.57 million of last year's second-quarter earnings.

<HEAD>Dollar Slips, Share Prices Inch Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar opened lower against the Japanese yen Friday morning, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rose slightly. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 16.62 points, or 0.05 percent, to move to 33,681.49 within the first 15 minutes. The index's rise followed gains in the last two trading days. The dollar opened at 141.60 yen, down 0.63 yen from Thursday's 142.23-yen finish The currency ended at 141.32 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight. Traders attributed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's lower opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to its losses in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> following comments by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> acknowledged that `` signs of softness in the economy have shown up'' and said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> must closely monitor the slowing economy. <PERSON> Masafuni </PERSON> <PERSON> Koyama </PERSON>, a trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The dollar opened lower following the Greenspan comments, but Japanese investors are inclined to buy it whenever the currency approaches the 141-yen mark.'' Analysts say investors fear a heavy loss for the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in Sunday's parliamentary election, which is widely expected, will cause the yen to plunge. `` Until the election Sunday, the dollar is unlikely to go lower than its current level,'' he said, adding that interbank trading dominated the early morning deals. Investors have avoided the yen and bought the dollar ahead of the election, despite prospects of a slowdown in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy shown in several indicators, including a 0.2 percent rise in the consumer price index for June.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, the admitted inside trader whose confessions spawned Wall Street's scandals, told a group of business students Thursday he has started a financial consulting practice in mergers and acquisitions. On other matters, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> praised the performance of government investigators as `` phenomenal,'' said the criminal justice system treated him fairly, criticized the media's portrayal of him as greedy, and expressed remorse for breaking the law. `` In my case, the combination of inexperience, unbridled ambition, impatience and gross errors of judgment led me to break the law,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> told about 100 students and faculty at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s business school. `` I blame myself and make no excuses and take full responsibility for my actions,'' he said. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, 36, who was not paid to speak at <ORGANIZATION> NYU </ORGANIZATION>, traced his involvement in a network of securities trading that used illegally obtained information about pending corporate takeovers to net $ 11.6 million in illicit profits. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> when he was charged in May 1986, said his illicit activities included a network of code names, foreign corporations and overseas bank accounts. `` In a vastly different environment, when I made the decision to cross the line I did n't think about getting caught,'' he said. `` I was a wet-behind-the-ears naive rookie who should have known better but did n't.'' Answering a student's question, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said that since his parole he has started a financial consulting practice and fought civil lawsuits he said have sought $ 1 billion in claims. `` I believe as a result of my prosecution and others the insider trading has declined,'' he said, adding that people who try that kind of activity today `` are playing Russian roulette.'' In a plea bargain with prosecutors, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> pleaded guilty to four felonies, was fined $ 362,000 and returned $ 11.6 million in illegal profits. He also told the government about <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the now-imprisoned insider trader who himself made millions of dollars using information supplied by <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> was paroled last September from a two-year prison term for securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury.

 Federal regulators late Thursday closed the 24 banking branches of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and established an interim institution to oversee the failed banks until they are fully acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it will spend $ 900 million in the bailout. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s 24 banks will open Friday as branches of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a bank created to enact the takeover, the agency said. Depositors, including those with funds that exceed the $ 100,000 federal insurance limit, will automatically become depositors of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The Texas American transaction raises the number of bank closings in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> this year to 95 and to 131 nationwide.

The new bank has total assets of about $ 4.2 billion and deposits of about $ 4.1 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> will sell stock and debt instruments to bring the resulting institution up to required regulatory financial standards. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> set aside $ 600 million in 1988 to assist <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> American. The regulator will absorb losses on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s problem assets, which <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> will manage Officials of both banks and the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> scheduled a news conference in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on Friday to discuss the transaction. Deposit Guaranty is a $ 600-million asset, privately owned bank that was built on the failures of other institutions. Its chairman, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinhart </PERSON>, in May told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he was interested in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> American. Before the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> transaction, <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> had purchased 13 banks, 11 of them in closed-bank, federally assisted deals. Even when <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> acquires troubled assets it is protected from losses by regulators. `` We're buying essentially with problems fully reserved, so that the large proportion of our people can direct their energies to building a bank and building a customer base,'' <PERSON> Steinhart </PERSON> said in May. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and San Antonio-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were targets of an acquisition attempt by <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohlad </PERSON> last year.

 Last-minute changes in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's clean air bill would ease up on requirements to reduce motor vehicle pollution and let the government push back cleanup deadlines, according to an administration summary made available Thursday. The changes were made after a June 30 draft became public and was widely criticized by environmentalists as not living up to what President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised on June 12. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> summary was given to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, a day before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to hold a White House ceremony to formally present the bill to lawmakers. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave the summary to reporters. After studying the summary, the head of an environmental group coalition, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>, said the bill would allow `` chicanery and fraud'' by industry and permit an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator so inclined to wreck the effort to clean the nation's dirty air. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, however, told reporters earlier the bill was `` faithful in every respect'' to the program <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined on June 12 to fix the nation's air pollution problem. `` There are no games,'' he said, indismissing the environmentalist criticism as `` inevitable pre-positioning'' on the legislation. `` Today's draft is far weaker than last month's draft, which was far weaker than the president's promises,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> environment subcommittee, which will hold the first hearing on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bill Monday. `` It undercuts the clean fuel program, pushes back compliance deadlines and loosens emissions standards. The bill actually appears to allow emissions from cars and trucks to increase from today's levels,'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said. Some of the changes: _ New buses in cities of more than 1 million population would be required to use special clean-burning fuels, starting in 1991-1994 The earlier draft required them in all cities of 250,000 or larger. The final bill also would permit the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to delay the requirement for two years. _ The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator could postpone for two years a clean fuel program for automobiles that would have to be sold in the nation's most polluted cities in _ The deadline for all cars to meet new emissions standards for hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides was pushed back from 1994 models to 1995 models _ Tougher emissions standards for light trucks could be phased in from 1993 to 1995 instead of being required by 1993 _ Criminal penalities against automakers for violating the anti-pollution standards were dropped In contrast to the environmental groups' vocal comments, industry has lobbied quietly, telling the administration _ and repeating to reporters who asked _ that the legislation has become too strict on business. A group of Republicans who appeared with <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> Thursday praised the bill, but kept repeating that the legislation was n't perfect, lacking tough cleanup timetables. `` The package does not pass all the tests,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehlert </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who added that the bill would have been better if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> had written it alone. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> reportedly fought often during the drafting of the bill, according to government sources who spoke only on condition they not be named. The sources said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> generally took the environmentalists side. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, said he would co-sponsor the legislation, but believed it needed tougher provisions for some industrial boilers, more incentives for utilities to pursue energy conservation, more specifics on reducing air toxics emissions and consideration of tougher provisions to reduce emissions of a contributor to smog _ nitrogen oxide. The environmentalists' criticism has included these points: sulfur dioxide emissions would be reduced less than originally indicated in the acid rain section; proposed fleet-wide averaging for auto emissions would fail to reduce motor vehicle pollution as promised; and that provisions to reduce toxic chemical emissions could be undermined by giving too high a priority to industry's economic considerations <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said the bill will be `` faithful in every respect to the spirit and letter of the promises he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- made,'' adding there was no `` post-announcement erosion.'' He contended environmentalists have been `` astonished at the sweeping breath of the legislation,'' but acknowledged `` they have their reservations as does everyone else. Some of the groups are going to advocate more. That's their role. Eventually, the country is going to unite behind this.''
