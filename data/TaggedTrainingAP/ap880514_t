<TEXT>
 Both sides reported progress at the second round of South Africa-Angola talks which ended Friday and said the talks would lead to further meetings soon involving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The governments are seeking an end to conflicts in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that include a civil war in Marxist <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and a war for independence in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, said, `` I hope that what we have started would one day be rewarded with peace, stability and prosperity for the whole of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` We are both agreed that there can be no military solution for our continent and in particular for southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The South African delegation was exuberant and clearly considered its reception in this socialist nation a triumph. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> exchanged gifts with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ndinga-Oba </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> before leaving for home. Congolese sources said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> met privately with President <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassou </PERSON> <PERSON> Nguesso </PERSON>, one of the continent's most vocal opponents of apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s policy of racial separation. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Justice Minister <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Van-Dunem </PERSON> led <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s delegation. `` We do know what each other wants and we cleared our stance,'' he said. Angolan and South African officials said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> diplomats would attend the next session of talks. Both nations attended talks last week in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> aimed at a regional peace settlement. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration seeks withdrawal of an estimated 40,000 Cuban soldiers from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> says its forces are there to help <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> fend off South African incursions. Rebels who have been fighting a guerrilla war for 13 years, seeking to overthrow the Angolan government, are supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, also is fighting a bush war trying to force <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to leave <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, commonly known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, and for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to become independent. Friday's four-hour talks were held in a small, government-owned villa and ended on a cordial note with each side thanking the other for its frankness. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Jury Awards $10 Million to Brain-Damaged Boy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal jury awarded $ 10 million Friday to a <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> child who suffered irreversible brain damage during birth. The four-man, two-woman <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury decided on the award after hearing testimony that three doctors named in the case did not act quickly when tests indicated the baby's heart rate was slowing. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Olender </PERSON>, attorney for 3-year-old <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said he believed it was the largest medical malpractice award ever in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Olender </PERSON> said obstetricians <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Safran </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON> performed an emergency caesarian section delivery about four hours after problems were first noticed. The operation was not conducted in time to prevent the child from suffering irreversible brain damage, <PERSON> Olender </PERSON> said. `` He's unable to walk, talk, or feed himself,'' said <PERSON> Olender </PERSON>. `` Everything has to be done for him.'' The judgment is about $ 6 million dollars greater than the malpractice insurance policy held by the doctors, who are in partnership. The child's parents, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, will receive no compensation in the award, <PERSON> Olender </PERSON> said. Instead, the money will be placed in a trust fund under court approval and used for the child's care. Attorneys for the doctors did not say whether an appeal of the verdict or award is planned. Problems in the birth arose around 4 a.m. on Dec. 11, 1984, when an electronic fetal monitor indicated that the child's heart rate was slowing, <PERSON> Olender </PERSON> told the court. In such cases, a declining heart rate often indicates a shortage of oxygen, usually resulting from a pinching of the umbilical cord, and emergency caesarian section deliveries are usually performed as soon as the problem is discovered, <PERSON> Olender </PERSON> asserted. The emergency operation did not take place until 9:15 a.m. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> hospital where the birth took place _ originally was named in the suit, but was dropped from the case when it agreed to pay $ 800,000 in a settlement.

<HEAD>Publisher Gets Nine-Month Sentence For Printing Statements Denying
Holocaust</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A publisher convicted in a retrial of maliciously publishing statements denying the Holocaust was sentenced Friday to nine months in jail. <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Zundel </PERSON>, 49, arrived at the district courthouse bearing a small coffin inscribed with the words `` Free Speech is Dead.'' After his 1985 conviction he went to his sentencing carring a heavy wooden cross, also signifying the demise of freedom of speech in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. As in his earlier conviction, <PERSON> Zundel </PERSON> is seeking to appeal his sentence and jury conviction and has applied for bail to keep him out of jail at least until his appeal can be considered. But he had to start the weekend behind bars awaiting a bail decision. The West German immigrant won his first appeal and was granted a new trial in district court that ended in the second conviction. <PERSON> Zundel </PERSON>, who operates <ORGANIZATION> Samisdat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, was charged under a law forbidding publication of statements known to be false or likely to cause injury or mischief to the public interest. <PERSON> Zundel </PERSON> was charged with publishing a booklet _ which he did not write _ that denies official accounts of Nazis exterminating Jews in wartime prison camps. The booklet says the horror stories about the Holocaust were all a hoax and a fraudulent scheme by Zionists to extract financial reparation from postwar <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. However, Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> took judicial notice of the Holocaust at the beginning of the trial, recognizing it as a historical fact. From then on, <PERSON> Zundel </PERSON>'s essential defense was that he honestly believed the contents of the pamphlet and was not knowingly spreading false news, as the charge alleged. Jewish leaders were happy with the verdict, saying it would serve to protect ethnic minorities from social intolerance. The Canadian Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said it `` demonstrates that Canadians will not tolerate the vilification of ethnological communities. `` It reaffirms the effectiveness of the Criminal Code in upholding social and racial harmony,'' group officials said. B'nai B'rith <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> expressed confidence the outcome `` will serve to deter hatemongers, no matter who their targets may be, from pursuing their aim of dividing Canadian society and turning some of us against our fellow citizens.''

 Police blamed a bad tip from an informant for the mistaken drug raid that left a family frightened and sent the father to a hospital with multiple cuts and bruises. `` These people are the victims of a tragic set of circumstances,'' <ORGANIZATION> Newark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Thursday. A police informant pointed out the <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> apartment as a place where narcotics had been dealt, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bok </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, 49, said he was alone Tuesday in the living room of the apartment he shares with his wife, three daughters and 78-year-old mother-in-law when police arrived outside his door.

Police have apologized to the family for the raid. The officers ransacked the house for more than a half-hour before realizing they were not in the home of drug dealers, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> disagreed, and said he believed that the officers did not search the apartment beyond `` determining who was in the apartment.'' `` It is my understanding,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, `` that shortly after entering the building they realized they must have gotten bad information and immediately backed off.''

 A divorced man who defied a principal's prohibition against escorting a high school student to her prom was promptly arrested on trespassing charges after arriving with his date Friday <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cripps </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, dressed in a black tuxedo, was taken into custody at the <ORGANIZATION> Dekalb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> prom after arriving with 18-year-old <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliger </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Dekalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cripps </PERSON>, 23, was freed on $ 250 bond, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. He was scheduled to appear in court May 25. Circuit Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddux </PERSON> had ruled earlier Friday that the school board and <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> could bar <PERSON> Cripps </PERSON> from escorting Sliger to the dance. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> had barred four divorced men from the prom after receiving an anonymous letter threatening `` trouble'' if they were allowed to attend, said school Superintendent <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` We felt that it was probably from one of the divorced wives, saying they did n't feel the school should let this type of thing occur,'' he said. `` There was a threat as far as just causing a disturbance.'' <PERSON> Sliger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 17, asked the court for a restraining order, arguing that that school officials were discriminating against their dates because of age and marital status, said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sliger </PERSON>'s mother. `` She's just crushed and her feelings were hurt so bad,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> said after the court ruling. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> conceded that the fact that the four men were divorced may have disturbed some school officials. `` I ca n't say that that was n't a factor, that might be a secondary factor because that gets into morals,'' he said. `` The primary factor was that there might be some problems, we have to ensure a safe environment for their prom.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> said that divorced people had been allowed to attend the prom in the past and that school officials overreacted to the anonymous letter. `` If they can keep people from going to the prom, then they can keep people who write a threatening letter from coming into the prom,'' she said.

The three-day conference, expected to draw 100 educators from around the country, is the latest event in what <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> described as her association's `` all-out war against AIDS.'' `` We are going to work with our members to determine what we can do as an organization to raise the consciousness level of the members of our profession,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Futtrell </PERSON>. The NEA is the nation's largest teacher union, with 1.9 million members. `` The role of a teacher is a especially critical in dealing with young people,'' she said. `` Children trust their teachers and they will go to their teachers for information. We must have factual information and know how to respond to young people.'' Ms. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> added she hopes the conference will spur action on AIDS education. `` We do n't think we can wait five years,'' she said. `` We need to begin to talk to young people now about changing their behavior so they do n't get the disease.'' Friday's keynote speaker was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an AIDS patient who is retired superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Brighton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We've got a mission,'' <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> said in an interview before his address. `` The kids in our high schools are going to bear the brunt of this disease and they're going to bear the cost.'' <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>, 48, was diagnosed last spring with AIDS and disclosed his illness in January, when he embarked on a series of appearances and speeches to educate high school and college students and teachers about the disease. `` Exploit me,'' said <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>. `` My time is limited. I want to be exploited by whoever can use me to put windows on what is now happening with AIDS and what is likely to happen. `` My years in public school work have groomed me. ... I'm not embarrassed by the questions,'' said <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>, who is homosexual. Other participants in the conference include researchers and officials of the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. Discussion will include ways to incorporate AIDS education into the school curriculum. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s parent agency, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, created in 1987 in an AIDS education effort. Last fall, the network distributed 1.9 million copies of a handbook for teachers on AIDS. AIDS has struck 973 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children under age 13; of those, 566 have died, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. In all, AIDS has struck more than 61,000 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, killing more than 34,000 of them.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is promising that next year's tax returns will be a little easier to understand, thanks in part to a handful of college students. The students, working through the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee earlier this year that tax forms and the instructions for filling them out can be made simpler. They took their recommendations to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Friday and the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> was impressed. `` We intend to look at the result of their wrestling with the instructions, of our wrestling, and then use the best of both,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, chairman of the agency's forms committee. `` It's a friendly effort,'' he added. `` There's going to be good come out of it.'' <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Creme </PERSON>, director of the taxation center in northeast <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, agreed. `` The 1040EZ and the 1040A should be a lot easier and understandable come next January,'' he said. Students at the center, who help low-income taxpayers facing <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> penalties, were spurred on by a study showing that more than half of Americans can not understand the instructions for the simplest tax form, the 1040EZ. They tackled first the instructions for the 1040EZ and the 1040A, and presented these recommendations Friday. By July 1 they hope to complete their proposed revisions of those two tax forms. Later, they want to rewrite thusands of pages of tax regulations and publications that are used by lawyers and other tax professionals. <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> and leaders of the student effort met for more than an hour Friday. `` It's a terrific experience to work with folks outside our organization and give them an opportunity to stand in our shoes,'' <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said. He acknowledged, however, that `` We still have a long way to go.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> law student, praised the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> for its interest in the effort. `` Many people do n't realize the problems of taking new tax laws and converting them into readable instructions,'' he said. `` We're interested in getting a real good product for the taxpayers.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student who is serving as design consultant for the project, called it `` the type of work we live for _ to take a document and see what it really means, what the people really need to know.'' The bulk of the suggestions for cleaning up the tax instructions dealt with format and layout. One of the key suggestions was that a final checklist be included in the instructions, since the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> acknowledges that most penalties are imposed because of mathematical errors. Another urged that the instructions be written alongside the tax forms; another called for fewer words and more white space on each page. The students also urged that the tone of the instructions be made more friendly, by generous use of the word `` please.'' They called for elimination of most of the multisyllable words and of double and triple negatives. As an example of how the wording can be cleaned up, the students pointed to a sentence in the instructions aimed at taxpayers who do n't get home-delivered mail. The instructions now read: `` If your post office does not deliver mail to your street address and you have a post office box, enter your post office box number on the line for your personal home address instead of your street address.'' The students' suggestion: `` If your mail is not delivered to your home, and you have a post office box number, put that number in the place of your street address.''

 A 29-year-old man in the southern <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> was executed for stealing 113 bicycles over more than two years, an official newspaper reported today. The Legal Daily said the intermediate people's court of <LOCATION> Shantou </LOCATION> had sentenced to death <PERSON> Xiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Guoqi </PERSON>, who was executed Friday, for infringing on the legitimate property of citizens and jeopardizing social order. It said <PERSON> Xiao </PERSON> stole $ 7,000 worth of bikes between March 1984 and May 1986. An accomplice, <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Kundi </PERSON>, was sentenced to 13 -LCB- years in prison. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> releases no figures on capital punishment, but is believed to have executed more than 10,000 convicted criminals since initiating an anti-crime drive in 1983. Murder, rape and multiple thefts are among the most common crimes leading to execution, normally a bullet to the back of the head.

 The lawyer for a woman convicted of poisoning two people with cyanide said he wants a mistrial after a juror admitted settling an unrelated product contamination lawsuit shortly before the trial began. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> questioned jurors Friday about whether they were improperly influenced during deliberations in the nation's first death-by-product-tampering trial. Most of the questioning was directed at juror <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>, who has acknowledged being the lone holdout for <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s acquittal before switching her vote to guilty on Monday, the fifth day of deliberation Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, was convicted of five counts of contaminating over-the-counter medicine capsules with cyanide. They included two counts of spiking the Excedrin capsules that killed her husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 52, and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, in June 1986. She faces possible life imprisonment at a June 17 sentencing. Prosecutors said she killed her husband to collect $ 176,000 in life insurance. Before a verdict was reached, Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> told <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> she had received an anonymous phone call the previous Friday telling her Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had failed an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> lie detector test. That information was inadmissible at trial. After the verdict, it was revealed Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> had filed a lawsuit of her own last year in a contaminated product incident, but had not mentioned that fact during jury selection. Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> after she bit into a Goldfish cracker in July 1986 that she said contained an aspirin-substitute pill. The matter was settled out of court for $ 500, less than two months prior to Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>'s selection for Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s jury. Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> told <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> she dismissed the anonymous call from her mind and judged the case on the facts. She also said she did not mention her own lawsuit during jury selection because she did not think it was relevant. Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> also said Friday that during the trial, she had talked with friends about writing an article about her jury experiences, but did not discuss facts of the case. After the unusual session Friday, defense lawyer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> said he would file a mistrial motion within a week. `` The testimony of juror <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON> raised very serious and troubling questions on her ability to sit on this jury,'' <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>'s failure to reveal her own suit kept lawyers from questioning her about that fact, <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> said. Further, he said there was no way to verify her statements that the phone call had no effect on her decision. Federal prosecutor <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> declined to comment.

 Soldiers were called out Friday to help dig for people missing in the rubble of a building collapse that killed at least 13 the day before. Red Cross and state government officials confirmed the number known dead and said 53 people were injured. <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, radio officer at police headquarters, said about 60 soldiers from the army garrison joined firefighters, police and volunteers in the rescue effort. Bulldozers and cranes were brought from as far away as <LOCATION> Salamanca </LOCATION>, 78 miles to the southwest. <LOCATION> Aguascalientes </LOCATION>, a city of about 500,000 people 320 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is the capital of <LOCATION> Aguascalientes </LOCATION> state. By late Friday, two or three people were believed still trapped in the rubble, <PERSON> Celia </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Torre </PERSON>, a state government spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, head of special services for the local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said hundreds of people came to help in the rescue. At least 116 workers were in the building when the four upper stories collapsed, said <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, reached by telephone from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Relatives of the victims practically attacked the ambulances, trying to identify'' the victims, he said. The building, still under construction, consisted of three basements, a main floor and three upper stories. As workers were about to pour the last concrete late Thursday afternoon, it collapsed onto a furniture factory that occupied the ground floor and part of the basement area. Lower floors of buildings in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> often are occupied while the upper stories are constructed. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Aguascalientes </LOCATION> state government spokesman, said the state attorney general's office was investigating the collapse of the building, which was three blocks from the main plaza and the state capitol. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Aguascalientes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said a committee of engineers and architects also would investigate. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, a police duty officer, said by telephone: `` They were apparently pouring fresh concrete when it caved in. Apparently the building did not resist the weight.'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, a survivor who was buried for five hours, was quoted by the Excelsior news agency as saying: `` I had finished working and was about to leave when ... all of a sudden everyone started yelling hysterically that there was an earthquake. I dashed under a table and all of a sudden everything went dark, and there was this terrific noise and there was dust everywhere.'' He said a slab of concrete fell on the table and `` that is what protected me from the rest of the debris.'' <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said he was quiet at first, but `` the fear and the anguish of being buried ... impelled me to yell very loud, and the rescue squads dug me out.'' Earlier Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> had reported 18 killed and 96 injured. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> duty officer at <LOCATION> Aguascalientes </LOCATION>, said there had been confusion about reports from the scene. He did not elaborate.

<HEAD>Senate Votes To Use Military Against Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has joined the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in ordering the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to jump into the war on drugs even though lawmakers say the plan wo n't solve <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s illicit drug problems. `` I think we all know the drug epidemic in this country is far past the stage where interdiction can stop it,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., agreed, noting that ordering the military to help `` shows that we're serious about drugs ... -LRB- but -RRB- I do n't think anybody's certain how much impact this will have. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> were among the supporters Friday night as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 83-6 to order the military to join the anti-drug war, including having <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers arrest suspected drug traffickers who are stopped by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in international waters. The plan was tacked on as an amendment to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill, which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is likely to approve early next week. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage will send the measure to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee to be reconciled with the different <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill passed Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. That measure includes an even stronger anti-drug package, ordering President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to have the military seal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders against drug traffickers. Senators trying to fashion an anti-drug plan for the military had spent three days working out the details, with the arrest provisions being the chief stumbling block. The military is prohibited from enforcing civilian laws by tradition and by the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act. But that law is in force only within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its territorial waters and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> arrest powers would be outside that jurisdiction. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, voted against the plan and criticized his colleagues for voting `` in a great hysteria.'' `` We're posturing on this,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. `` We all get up, posture, make our little statements and it is n't going to make any difference. ... This is not the mission for the military.'' Military officials have generally opposed the plan, arguing that military personnel are trained differently than civilian law enforcement officials, and noting that traditionally there has been a firm line drawn between civilian and military law enforcement. But <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> worked on the plan with the senators, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved it before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and other senators noted. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., said he had originally opposed using the military to fight drugs, but changed his mind because `` the drug flow has reached flood tide ... we can not ignore.

<HEAD>Trade Bill Likely To Survive Veto, Business Leaders Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Business leaders and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials are betting that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have worked too hard to fashion trade legislation to scuttle it after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s expected veto. `` Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have put a great deal of work in this legislation and my judgment is that these persons will not wish to see the bill disappear,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Friday. `` They have a great deal of time, effort, energy and creativity invested in this piece of legislation.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he expected the president to deliver his veto message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next week, but he said he was optimistic about it not meaning the end of the three-year effort to write the trade bill. Although not specifically mentioning <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, by name, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> noted that a provision repealing the windfall oil profits tax is dear to the hearts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> legislators. `` I suspect it will be particularly difficult for them to explain to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> constituents that they were willing to drop a piece of legislation so important to the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> spoke with reporters after addressing a private session of the Business Council. Composed of 61 chief executives of the nation's largest corporations, the council meets twice a year at the Homestead, a posh resort in the mountains of southwestern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is vetoing the massive trade bill because of a provision that would require companies to give 60 days' notice of plant closings and major layoffs. The administration supports much of the 1,000-page bill, but objects to the plant-closing provision, which <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> called `` onerous.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the technical language of the provision would provide `` a field day for lawyers and a nightmare for American businessmen'' by providing a legal basis for challenging virtually every plant closing or layoff. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, one of the executives attending the retreat ending today, acknowledged that a veto of the trade bill risked losing `` very constructive'' legislation, but he said, `` The business community is prepared to take that risk. `` It's been called simple plant-closing legislation, well it's 10 sections and 56 subsections and inconsistent language,'' he said The business executives, in an economic report issued at the start of their conference, predicted that last year's record trade deficit of $ 171.2 billion would drop below $ 150 billion this year. But, the forecast, which reflects a consensus of the member companies' chief economists, said the reduction would not be enough to stem the fall of the dollar. It said the dollar, which has lost about half of its value against the Japanese yen in two years, would fall from its present level of 125 yen to about 115 yen by the end of 1989. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest bank holding company, said a substantial improvement in the trade deficit was iminent because of the devalued dollar. A weaker dollar improves <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export prospects by lower the cost of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods overseas. `` There is a price at which the trade balance will turn around, and most of us think we're pretty close to it,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. Generally, the executives' forecast painted a rosy picture of moderate economic growth, manageable inflation and low unemployment. It said growth, as measured by the gross national product, would be 2.4 percent this year, down from 3.8 percent last year. Inflation of consumer prices was expected to be 3.9 percent this year, down from 4.4 percent in 1987. Unemployment, now at 5.4 percent, should remain under 6 percent through 1989, the executives said.

<TEXT>
 A big question for farmers is whether the general recovery in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture will continue long enough for them to pull out of the financial mire that has gripped many since the early 1980s. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is n't making flat predictions about that, but one of its economists says general economic conditions `` are not expected to make or break the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural sector'' during the next 18 months. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Monaco </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the next year and a half will be one of those periods when `` macroeconomic factors'' are n't likely to set the course for the nation's farmers. By contrast, the financial crunch on farmers in the early'80s sprang largely from events over which they had no control: a worldwide recession, a rise in the value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar against foreign currencies, and high interest rates. For the last couple of years, however, the farm outlook has improved dramatically, overall, and in 1987 <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> says the net cash income of farmers was at a record level of $ 57 billion. This year's forecast is down, perhaps in the range of $ 50 billion to $ 55 billion, because of higher production costs and a reduction in federal payments But <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION>, whose assessment was reported in this month's Farmline magazine, says he is optimistic about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy in general and that he expects a replay of 1987 conditions For the next year and a half, <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION> thinks, the real growth of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy will be about 3 percent a year, inflation will not accelerate significantly -LRB- remaining at 3.5 percent to 4 percent annually -RRB-, interest rates will be relatively stable, and unemployment will continue its slow decline. Some other <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION>'s observations: _ Both the federal budget deficit and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit should continue to improve The budget deficit dropped to $ 150 billion in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30 from $ 221 billion in 1986. The trade deficit improved in real terms by $ 10 billion last year, the first substantial gain since 1980. _ Exports of both agricultural and non-agricultural products are likely to continue gaining in 1988 A key factor has been the decline in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies, which makes it cheaper to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products. _ The improved exports and business investment should continue to drive the current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic expansion, now in its sixth straight year In the 1983-86 period, however, the economy was led by consumer and government spending. _ Real growth, as measured by the nation's gross national product, or GNP, has done well since 1982, the last recession year, averaging a gain of 3.1 percent a year `` In general, positive signs seem to prevail over recent concerns about deficits and stock market volatility,'' <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION> said. But he added: `` Prospects for the rest of the world are less favorable than for this country. Low export earnings and high debts are still a serious problem for many developing countries. And economic growth remains uneven around the world.''

 Farmers are hiring more workers this spring, and they are paying more for them, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> survey. The department said Friday that its survey last month indicated 958,000 hired workers were employed by farmers, compared with 885,000 in the comparable period of April 1987. Those did not include 224,000 `` agricultural service'' workers provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. Those were up from 188,000 a year earlier, the report said. Field work was hampered in some parts of the country by rain and wet ground when the survey was taken during the week of April 10-16, the report said. But corn planting was getting under way in most major production states and was about 6 percent completed by the end of the week. Planting of cotton, spring wheat and other crops also took place during the week surveyed. `` Lettuce harvest was just beginning in <LOCATION> Salinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and was very active in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` Harvest of cantaloups, watermelons and honeydew melons progressed well in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s valencia orange harvest continued, and grapefruit movement was strong.'' The report said the national figures for hired workers had a sampling error of 4.5 percent. Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $ 5 per hour, up from $ 4.90 a year earlier, the report said. For those workers provided by contractors, there was no national wage rate available. However, workers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> averaged $ 5.68 per hour, down from $ 6.15 a year ago, while those in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> received an average of $ 6.15 per hour in April, up from $ 5.85 a year ago, the report said.

 Composers from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> will meet in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in August in the first large-scale conference supported by professional arts organizations from the two rival governments, organizers say. In a release received in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> today, the Center for <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said 10 composers each from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> will take part in the Aug. 6-14 conference on `` Tradition and the Future of Chinese Music.'' Center Director <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> Wen-chung </PERSON> said the 1987 relaxation of restrictions on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> residents visiting mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> contributed to a growing interest in cultural and educational exchanges. `` Because the center is in touch with artists in both places, we were aware that this moment offered an extraordinary opportunity,'' he said. <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> said he hoped the conference would lead to greater cultural cooperation and contact in the arts between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. The Nationalist government on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has rejected all proposals by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for direct trade and cultural contacts. However, <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>'s decision last year to let residents visit the mainland led to a sharp increase in contacts between people on both sides of the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>. The release said consultants who will help choose the conference participants include <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsang-houei </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuqiang </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> and Arts Circles.

<HEAD>Trade Bill Would Hold Import Dealer Hostage, Trade Group Says</HEAD>

 Trade legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could cost the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> thousands of jobs in the nation's nearly 10,000 imported-auto dealerships, their trade association says. `` The massive <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> imported automobile market is going to be held hostage,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McElwaine </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, at a news conference Friday. The $ 40 billion-a-year imported automobile industry is a likely target if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> move to restrict imports in a trade dispute, <PERSON> McElwaine </PERSON> said. `` We are the first target for retaliation,'' he said. `` We are such a huge target. Not only is there a large volume of product, it is such an expensive product, and there is a large amount of money involved.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has vowed to veto the trade bill because of a provision requiring advance notice of plant closings. Should <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto the bill, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be in a better position next year to write less damaging trade legislation, <PERSON> McElwaine </PERSON> said. `` By next year, according to our calculations, the trade deficit will have been drastically reduced, the export wave will be at full flood, -LRB- and -RRB- <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s prosperous economy will be so export-dependent that few would be willing to risk derailing the economy with an ill-advised trade bill,'' <PERSON> McElwaine </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McElwaine </PERSON> said the danger to his industry comes from provisions designed to encourage the executive branch to retaliate against nations restricting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to their markets. `` I think it would cause us damage,'' <PERSON> McElwaine </PERSON> said. Restrictions on imports of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> cars alone could potentially cost 15,000 jobs at dealerships, <PERSON> McElwaine </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>State to Drop Controls Over Art Troupes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is lifting controls on most art troupes and will let individuals organize their own performing groups, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The daily quoted Culture Minister <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Meng </PERSON> as saying state-run art troupes will be replaced with a system that will permit free and open competition among troupes. Performers will be allowed to set their own box office prices and decide their own programs as long as they are licensed and do not violate state laws and regulations. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said the reforms are designed to stimulate the professional enthusiam of the 200,000 people working in the nation's 3,094 art troupes. He said many state-run troupes, where lifetime employment prevails, are overstaffed, especially with those who are old and in poor health. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said the state will continue to run a small number of the country's best troupes or those needing special state support. Among those are new experimental groups and groups in ethnic minority areas. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said state-run troupes will also adopt a new salary system with outstanding performers receiving better pay than those with mediocre skills or past their prime. The state's decision to give up its monopoly over the arts has drawn some criticism in the official press, with artists being quoted as saying many traditional Chinese and minority musical, dance and opera troupes are doomed by the `` survival of the fittest'' policy. Concern has also been raised that troupes forced to pay their own way will turn to sex, violence and superstition to draw audiences.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders appear satisfied enough with verification measures worked out in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to open debate next week on the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty. But Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he will not formally schedule that debate until three <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees hold hearings and approve the `` I want to hear what the chairmen and ranking Republican members of these committees have to say following these hearings,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` They are the experts in this field.'' Some senators said there is now at least a chance the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will consent to the ratification of the treaty by the time President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> convene their <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit on May 29. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is set to testify before the Foreign Relations Committee on Monday afternoon on the agreement he reached this week in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. The Armed Services and Intelligence committees announced they will hold a joint private meeting late Monday afternoon. Following a 90-minute luncheon briefing Friday by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said he and other <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders were told the agreement removes a roadblock and is a forward step. Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> quoted <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s decision last week to postpone <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action on the treaty `` did make a difference'' in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Negotiators addressed concerns in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that the Soviets were backing away from effective implementation of the on-site inspection provisions of the treaty. Other senators who attended the briefing also said the results of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks seem constructive. `` I'm optimistic we can move ahead,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think at this moment there is more optimism for the passage of this treaty than at at any other time during this long process,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., the ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviets changed their position to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objections on every issue that was raised. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, providing for the total elimination of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet mid-range missiles, at their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December.

<HEAD>Bald Eagle Deaths Worrisome to Environmental Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The deaths of 10 bald eagles that apparently ate illegally poisoned animal carcasses threaten the comeback of the endangered birds in the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, federal officials said. `` While our national symbol is making a recovery, it can not sustain this rate of loss month after month nor will we tolerate it,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Five dead eagles, one adult and four immature bald eagles, were found May 3 in a field near the carcasses of three raccoons, a deer and a vulture. Five others were found elsewhere in <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> between March 12 and May 1, including the <ORGANIZATION> Blackwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>. `` The birds are not in danger of becoming extinct'' because of illegal poisoning of animals, but `` the deaths resulting will have some impact on their recovery because the deaths are occurring in an area where we have a large amount of bald eagles,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Therres </PERSON>, the non-game and endangered species program manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, Park and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. State and federal officials said they are particularly concerned because the county has the greatest concentration of bald eagles in the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. The eagle population, devastated by the use of the pesticide DDT in the 1950s and 1960s, had been restored to its highest levels on the East Coast. Officials are testing tissue from the dead eagles and the carcasses for chemicals. Results are expected in several weeks, but because the eagles had been dead at least a month before they were found, such analyses can be difficult, said <PERSON> Inez </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Corner </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` The fact there has been a carcass near all of the eagles we have found leads us to think that they died as a result of eating poisoned animals,'' Ms. <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> said. Criminal charges could be brought against anyone found to be poisoning animals. Bald eagles are protected under federal law.

<HEAD>Walsh Says Justice Department Has Final Word On Document
Declassification</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has the final word on whether certain classified material can be used in the Iran-Contra trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three co-defendants. That concession could enable the department to scuttle the prosecution of the fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. In a legal memorandum filed in the case, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said he `` must be deferential to the executive's determination as to whether national security concerns prevent public disclosure of validly classified information.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has amassed 50,000 classified government documents that may be relevant to the prosecution of charges that <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> conspired to illegally divert to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels the profits from sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Another 250,000 secret documents may contain information relevant to the defense of the case. By <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s description, the most sensitive 5 percent to 10 percent of the documents contain secrets about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence and military operations and sensitive foreign policy initiatives. Under the Classified Information Procedures Act -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, the attorney general must certify to the court that disclosure of certain documents as evidence in court would endanger national security. The law provides for substitution of summaries of the documents or statements of what the evidence would prove if revealed in open court. The court has the power to dismiss criminal cases if too much evidence is withheld. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has warned that he would dismiss charges if relevant secret documents are not declassified for use at the trial as evidence. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> also has expressed an unwillingness to spend a lot of time rewriting classified documents so that they could be presented as evidence in a public trial. He has given <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> until June 10 to submit a list of documents the independent counsel wants to use as prosecution evidence that wo n't be declassified. The legal memorandum from <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> was filed in response to a question about the issue that the judge posed during a May 6 hearing. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said: `` It is an inherent function of the executive branch to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive national security information to the extent necessary to permit the government to conduct its foreign affairs and national defense activities effectively. `` Neither the independent counsel statute nor the regulation purports to confer upon independent counsel any general power of declassification.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who has been questioned repeatedly by the Iran-Contra grand jury about his November 1986 investigation of the arms-for-hostages deals, has recused himself from the case, or any others involving independent counsels. Any decision about classified information in the Iran-Contra case would have to be made by an acting attorney general. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said that under a 1982 executive order on classified documents, he has no authority to declassify government secrets and must therefore defer to the authority of the attorney general. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said he agreed to comply with the 1982 executive order when he obtained the 300,000 pages of classified documents in the course of his investigation.

 The pilots who safely landed an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner April 28 after the cabin blew open at 24,000 feet said Friday they look forward to returning to the air in a few days. `` I've ridden in a couple airplanes since the incident,'' the pilot, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON>, said at a news conference. `` I'm really more comfortable at the controls of an airplane than I am in this setting here. Schornstheimer and co-pilot <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> landed the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 on the island of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> after a third of the cabin peeled away on a Hilo-to-Honolulu flight. A flight attendant was swept to her death and 61 passengers were injured. A check of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> records Friday showed 14 cracks or instances of corrosion were found in several routine maintenance checks on the plane before the accident, but none of the defects was found in the area of the damage. According to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records, each of the cracks or corroded areas was repaired by replacing sections of the plane's metal skin. A federal investigation has focused on metal fatigue as a possible cause of the accident. Neither pilot would discuss the cause. However, they related the 15 harrowing minutes while they guided the crippled plane to an emergency landing. `` It was a split-second thing. There was a loud noise and the cockpit door was gone and there was blue sky,'' Schornstheimer said. He added: `` Normally, you do n't expect to lose that much of an airplane and still be able to fly it.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records, the defects uncovered during routine maintenance by <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON> were on the rear-bottom portions or wings of the plane during routine <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> inspections. The top of the cabin peeled away in the accident. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wantiez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON> director of engineering, said the number of defects was `` not untypical of some airplanes, but probably better than most.'' `` Generally, it was in quite good shape from a corrosion standpoint,'' <PERSON> Wantiez </PERSON> said. `` The basic airplane looked quite clean.''

<HEAD>Week-Old Soviet Opposition Party Outlines Bold Platform</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new opposition group challenging the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s political monopoly has outlined a platform that calls for free trade unions and end to Soviet domination of the Baltic states and of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The week-old <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, whose members have been harassed by authorities as `` anti-social,'' said in unveiling the progam Friday that it plans to try to register with the state but expects to be rebuffed. At least a dozen uniformed policemen milled around outside as party organizers gathered in a crowded eighth-floor apartment in northwest <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to discuss plans for political action. Police made no attempt to stop those entering or leaving. The group's declaration of goals and principles followed a week of meetings in which organizers said more than 150 Soviets from 27 cities took part. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Denisov </PERSON>, one of the party's 15 Central Coordinating Council members, told journalists it would try to comply with laws requiring groups to register their activity, `` but of course we expect problems with that and we do not expect to succeed.'' Another coordinating council member, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukashev </PERSON>, outlined broad party policies. He said the group aims to present an `` opposition'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s monopoly on power and political thought. The group opposes the `` Soviet occupation'' of the Baltic states of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, and Soviet actions in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that have helped keep Communist government in power there, he said. The party has called for independent trade unions, and on Friday issued a statement denouncing Polish officials' actions to halt industrial strikes over the past month in the Soviet-allied country. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> comes out in opposition to totalitarianism of political parties,'' the group's statement of principles declares as its first objective. The party program sets out methods for calling elections and filling leadership positions, and says funds raised by the group will be used for `` informational activity, agitation, printing costs and organizational needs.'' Party activists complained that their first week was marred by `` repressive'' and `` unconstitutional'' actions of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, local police forces and the state-run press. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency denounced the party on Wednesday, accusing the activists of `` slanderous, anti-social activity.'' Dozens of participants were detained by police after meetings last weekend, with sentences of five to seven days in jail handed down summarily to four of them, including dissident magazine editor <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, who edits the unofficial magazine `` Glasnost,'' remained jailed Friday night and no one had been permitted to see him, the activists said. <PERSON> Denisov </PERSON> said the party planned a political conference in the fall, but that details of that gathering had not been worked out yet.

 The battle to keep a landmark art deco hotel from being turned into a parking lot heated up as preservationists and the city struggled to save it and the owner began pulling plumbing from the building. `` People are distressed and distraught that we would be losing a building,'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebman </PERSON>, legislative liaison for the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday as a work crew carted plumbing and scrap metal from the beachfront Senator Hotel. `` While it's still here, it's worth a continuous battle,'' she said. The three-story, green-and-white hotel was built in 1939, and is on the National Register of Historic Places, Ms. <PERSON> Liebman </PERSON> said. It is one of 800 art deco buildings in the mile-square area that comprises the only official art deco district in the world, she said. The closed hotel's owner, the <ORGANIZATION> Royale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, must raze the Senator for parking spaces as a condition for obtaining bank loans to renovate other art deco buildings it owns, <ORGANIZATION> Royale </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said. `` It's not we're anti-preservation, but we have to be practical, too,'' <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said. A date for demolishing the building has not been set. Mayor <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> said he hopes last-ditch negotiations scheduled next week with the <ORGANIZATION> Royale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s owners will keep the wrecking ball away. `` We're doing everything within our power to preserve it,'' said <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, whose staff is checking legal avenues, possible land swaps and the feasibility of buying the hotel. Preservationists will keep an eye on the building, Ms. <PERSON> Liebman </PERSON> said. `` It's hard to see where this urgent crush for parking is,'' she said. `` The Senator has every single deco feature. It's a perfect example, an important masterpiece.'' The art deco district's buildings are painted pastel colors and sport geometric designs, its sidewalks are painted pink and it's often featured on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Miami Vice'' television show The city is pushing for the renovation of the district's buildings in its effort to bring back the glory days of tourism The 70-room Senator is a crucial part of the district, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Capitman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Senator ... has probably the most famous etched glass in the district,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Capitman </PERSON> said. `` It is a particularly seductive building.'' Ms. <PERSON> Liebman </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Capitman </PERSON> accuse the <ORGANIZATION> Royale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of ignoring pleas from them and city officials to save the hotel, which was closed after the group bought it in 1984. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> countered that in the nine months it took his clients to obtain a demolition permit, no one offered a viable alternative. He said none is expected now. `` Our people are more active in preserving than any others on the beach,'' <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said. Preservationists `` have blinders on, they're not in the real world.'' <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> said he remained optimistic, but understood the <ORGANIZATION> Royale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s problems. `` They first started to restore it, purchased new doors and fixtures, but what happened was they had to provide this parking,'' <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> said. `` It's almost a Catch-22: you've got a developer renovating the area, doing a great job, and he's the same individual who's knocking down one of our architectural treasures to make room for parking.

 A proposed purchase of the regional <ORGANIZATION> Missouri-Kansas-Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been tentatively approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, sources say. The regulatory agency has scheduled an official announcement on Monday of its decision. Agency and congressional sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, said the commission had voted 4-0 on Friday to permit the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> and MKT merger. The Union Pacific, a 21,500-mile network, proposed in November 1986 to acquire the 3,100-mile MKT system, known as the Katy line, for $ 110 million and to assume its outstanding debts. As proposed, the merger would eliminate about 1,100 <PERSON> Katy </PERSON> jobs because of closing of rail yards and repair shops. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> also proposed the abandonment of 405 miles of track, mostly operated by <PERSON> Katy </PERSON>. The Union Pacific, the nation's third largest railroad system in terms of track mileage, serves about 20 states with routes from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in the West to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The company was formed in 1982 with the merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> railroads. The Katy serves six states, with mostly north-south routes running from <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he had no information on how commissioners had voted in the case, and could not confirm or deny that the merger had been approved. The sources said retiring commissioner <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterrett </PERSON>, who did not seek reappointment to a new term on the agency, did not vote. The agency made its decision by a voting system that does not require a public meeting. The railroads say consolidating their operations would provide shippers with better service at lower costs, and offer direct single-line routes in some areas. Without the merger, the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> has been told, the financially troubled <PERSON> Katy </PERSON> will have difficulty surviving against bigger competitors.

 A house fire started by burning candles killed a 9-year-old girl and injured her brother hours after the power company cut off electricity for non-payment of a $ 34.86 bill, officials said. <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiggs </PERSON> was pronounced dead at <ORGANIZATION> Centinela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Inglewood </LOCATION> early Friday after she was pulled from her burning home, sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> said. Her brother, <PERSON> Antwon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiggs </PERSON>, 12, was in critical condition at <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hawthorne </LOCATION>, a nursing supervisor said. Their sister, <PERSON> Vernicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolts </PERSON>, 17, who was caring for the younger children while their parents attended a church meeting, was treated and released. Several deputies, firefighters and paramedics were overcome by smoke or cut by glass, but all were treated and released at area hospitals. The fire was reported at 11:41 p.m. Thursday. Miss Bolts had blown out most of the candles being used to light the house before everyone went to bed, but apparently at least one kept burning and ignited the blaze, county fire Inspector <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Sotro </PERSON> said. Earlier Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> disconnected service to the house because the family's $ 34.86 bill was overdue, said <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, an area manager for the utility. `` There had been a credit problem over a long period of time,'' <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> said. `` They had been given proper notice. We hand delivered a final notice on May 3. There was no response. The final notice expired on May 11. On May 12, service was disconnected.'' The deadline for payment had been extended several times for the family and the account had been overdue for at least a year, <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> said. Firefighters estimated damage caused by the fire at $ 205,000.

 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> says Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s tour of <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> will proceed as planned after the country's authoritarian government backed off on its bid to block a papal meeting with opposition The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> had said earlier that it was `` astonished'' that the government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> would try to alter the schedule for the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, the last stop on his four-nation, 12-day South American tour. In <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, meanwhile, today's stop on the papal tour, a column of 60 marching leftist rebels firebombed a hotel where the papal press center is headquartered. In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, a center for this nation's notorious cocaine trade, the pope on Friday issued his harshest condemnation of drug trafficking since he began the trip May 7 in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>. At the city's municipal airport _ which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agents say is used intensively by cocaine runners _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> told about 220,000 people at a Mass that the drug trade `` leads to the most terrible form of slavery and sows your soil with corruption and death. `` There is an urgent need not only to protect youth from drug consumption but to combat trafficking itself, which is a totally infamous activity,'' the pontiff said. He challenged his audience to tackle a long list of ills that plague <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poorest country. Also Friday, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said in a communique released in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> that `` The holy father's pastoral visit to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> will proceed just as planned.'' Earlier this week, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s government canceled <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s scheduled Tuesday meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s capital About 350 intellectuals, businessmen and politicians belong to the group, which is sponsored by the church and includes representatives of unauthorized opposition parties. <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> had said the ban was for `` security reasons.'' According to Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> statement, the lifting of the ban was arranged at a meeting between <LOCATION> Paraguayan </LOCATION> government representatives and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> ambassador and local bishops. Cancellation of the meeting would have marked the first time a government altered <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s official itinerary on the 37 overseas trips he has made since becoming pope nearly 10 years ago. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, a general and the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s longest-reigning leader, has run <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> since 1954 In <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, marching rebels, many wearing hoods and chanting revolutionary slogans, tossed a fire bomb, threw rocks and smashed three large front windows as they paraded in front of the Hotel Crillon. The violence came amid a wave of guerrilla activity Friday and followed a week-long series of rebel attacks. <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Cuba </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas on Thursday briefly disrupted a mass at the the <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toribio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION>, where the pope is to speak this weekend, and urged those attending to join their leftist insurgency, church officials have said. The same day, Maoist rebels bombed a police bus on a busy downtown street and wounded 14 policemen in one of the bloodiest attacks ever in the capital. The hotel bomb, described as a Molotov cocktail by employees, broke a window and set an inside curtain ablaze, witnesses said. There were no injuries and the blaze was rapidly doused, police said. The press center for the papal visit is headquartered on the main floor of the plush hotel. Also Friday, leftist guerrillas bombed a bank and strafed a military installation with machine-gun fire from a passing car, police said. There were no injuries in either attack.

<TEXT>
 Dr. <PERSON> Donal </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> will leave the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> next week free and clear of charges that he killed three patients through surgical negligence. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> decided Friday against appealing a military review court's decision to overturn <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s conviction on involuntary-manslaughter charges. The charges stemmed from <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s tour as chief heart surgeon at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s flagship <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> also has approved a request from <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>, a commander in rank, to be released from active duty, said Lt. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullin </PERSON>, a spokesman for the service. `` He will be released without pension sometime next week,'' <PERSON> Cullin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cullin </PERSON> said the decision against an appeal was made by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s judge advocate general, Rear Adm. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>, 57, was convicted in early 1986 on charges of involuntary manslaughter and negligence in the deaths of three patients. He was sentenced on March 3, 1986, to four years in prison and last summer was rebuffed in his first bid for parole from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s case attracted extensive public attention, in part because of the sensational nature of some of the charges It also prompted congressional reviews of military health care in general and several large monetary settlements between the government and relatives of <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s patients. Prosecutors described <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> as an egocentric man, nearly blind in one eye, who hid his visual handicap and continued performing complex heart operations despite numerous warnings that he was killing patients. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy-Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> concluded April 13, however, the prosecution never showed that <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s surgical technique and conduct in the operating room were so out of line as to constitute criminal conduct The spokesman said 36 legal claims totaling $ 153.6 million were ultimately filed against the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in connection with cases handled by <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>. To date, 12 have been settled for a combined $ 2.2 million, eight denied and 16 are pending, <PERSON> Cullin </PERSON> said. `` After reviewing the opinion ..., the judge advocate general has determined there is no viable, legal basis for further review,'' <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said in a statement.

 A bomb exploded inside a truck early Saturday near reviewing stands being prepared for farewell ceremonies marking the Soviet withdrawal. Police said eight people were killed and 20 injured. The blast occurred at 5:45 a.m. -LRB- 9:15 p.m. EDT -RRB- in a housing area on the banks of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Witnesses said they saw four bodies being removed from a house that was destroyed. The blast demolished embankment walls on both sides of the river that threads through the Afghan capital. Blood was visible on the gates of a nearby factory and personal belongings, including carpet slippers, were scattered in the street. Witnesses said flames were visible when they arrived shortly after the blast. The bomb had been planted in a large truck that lay badly mangled at the scene. Last month, six people were killed and 49 wounded in another bomb blast along the river banks on the 10th anniversary of the April 1978 revolution that brought a Marxist government to power in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and triggered widespread insurrection. Soviet soldiers entered the war in December 1979 to help the allied government fight off the anti-Communist rebels. About 115,000 remain here to back forces loyal to President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. But under an accord signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on April 14, the Soviet troops begin pulling out Sunday and are to complete the withdrawal within nine months. Information for this account was based on a news agency pool report from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>.

 Clouds of smoke rose over the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bluffs as competitors fired up their cookers for <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>' annual barbecue contest, a weekend party of pork and beer billed as the largest shindig of its kind `` If you do him right, it'll take 24 hours,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said Friday as he opened the side of his black iron cooker to proudly display a 135-pound pig being turned into a tender treat. `` We'll serve him with a spoon, not a knife,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> added. The cook-off, part of the city's annual Memphis In May Festival, drew 175 cooking teams from around the country to compete in three categories: whole hog, ribs and pork shoulder. Judging was set for this afternoon, and the winners were to be announced tonight. Many of the teams, varying from three or four members to dozens, also took part in a showmanship contest Friday. They staged skits in costume outside their cooking booths, which ranged from simple tents to elaborate two-story affairs and fully equipped kitchens mounted on trailers. Barbecue cookers included plain iron drums and fancy customized rigs. One team prepared its pork in a large metal cooker shaped like a rabbit. Another relied on a bright red compact car gutted and lined with iron to fashion a cooker. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who owns a marine engine business in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, cooked his team's barbecue in what was once a 900-horsepower diesel engine. Mounted on a 20-foot-long trailer with a built-in kitchen, the shiny steel-and-iron rig cost about $ 20,000, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. `` We're ecologically sound. We catch our own waste and we're totally self-contained,'' he said `` When we get there, we're there We've got water. We've got electricity. Just add pork and stir.'' The contest is for pork cookers only, and <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Bollheimer </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the 11-year-old event, said organizers were trying for a world record for the amount of pork barbecue served in a single day. The cook-off is billed as a `` world championship,'' but organizers were trying for the first time to take a formal accounting of the amount of meat cooked by the competitors. They predicted the total would be in the tons. `` We've heard rumors that other contests are trying to claim title as the largest, but we do n't think they have a chance,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bollheimer </PERSON> said. `` We will bask in the glory of knowing we're the world's largest barbecue contest.'' The Memphis In May Festival focuses on a different country each year, and this year's guest was <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, leading to numerous Union Jacks and other British decorations at barbecue booths. One team, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kilted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kookers </ORGANIZATION>, included several members from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, even though their background as barbecue cookers was limited. <PERSON> Tam </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> said it was his first brush with American barbecue. `` I tasted the ribs for the first time last night,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` I found some meat on the bones and it was great. The only ribs I'd had before were from a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant.''

 Rescuers cleared crumbled concrete on the fading hope that someone might still be alive under the rubble of an unfinished four-story building 1 -LCB- days after it collapsed, killing at least 13 people. Officials said Friday that at least 53 people were injured when the structure came crashing down as workers were about to pour the last concrete at a furniture factory that occupied the ground floor and part of the basement. Some of the injured were buried for hours. `` I had finished working and was about to leave when ... all of a sudden everyone started yelling hysterically that there was an earthquake,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, who was buried for five hours. `` I dashed under a table and all of a sudden everything went dark, and there was this terrific noise and there was dust everywhere,'' he told the Excelsior news agency. He said a slab of concrete that fell on the table protected him from the rest of the debris. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said he was quiet at first, but `` the fear and the anguish of being buried ... impelled me to yell very loud, and the rescue squads dug me out.'' The <LOCATION> Aguascalientes </LOCATION> state government said 13 people died, including a 16-year-old boy riding past the building on a bicycle when it collapsed Thursday. But a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official said at least 14 people were known dead. All day Friday, officials gave conflicting estimates of the number of people believed trapped under the rubble. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> attendant on duty late Friday in this city 320 miles northwest of the capital, said crews were painstakingly working their way down through the massive rubble. Rescuers swung sledgehammers at chunks of rubble and passed concrete blocks down a line as they cleared the debris piece by piece. `` Below, we think there is no longer anyone alive because there would n't be enough air,'' <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON> said. He said a large amount of dirt had fallen in with the building, which had three basement levels, a main floor and three upper stories. `` We have the building plans and we are making tunnels where we think there may be people and when we determine there are not, we will begin to use machines,'' he said. He said workers planned to search through the night. <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, the radio officer at police headquarters in this city of half a million residents, said about 60 soldiers from the army garrison joined firefighters, police and volunteers in the rescue effort. Bulldozers and cranes were brought from as far away as <LOCATION> Salamanca </LOCATION>, 78 miles to the southwest. <PERSON> Celia </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Torre </PERSON>, a state government spokeswoman, said late Friday the number of dead stood at 13. <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON> said 14 were known dead. He said 12 bodies had been recovered and two others remained in the rubble. Two people were missing, he said. Mrs. de la <PERSON> Torre </PERSON> said authorities believed two or three may still be trapped. Mrs. de la <PERSON> Torre </PERSON> said original estimates that several dozen people were trapped may have been high and many may have escaped uninjured. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, head of special services for the local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said at least 116 workers were in the building when it collapsed. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, a state government spokesman, said the state Attorney General's Office had begun an investigation to determine who was responsible for the collapse of the building three blocks from the main plaza and the state capitol.

Construction is banned on weekends, but the tennis ball machines would not be. Since March, when the noise complaint issue arose, many residents have urged the committee to ban the machines' use on weekends. `` On an absolutely still summer evening, with no trains, no airplanes and no boats going by, the tennis machines could conceivably be very annoying because of their rhythmic thump, thump, thump,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilyinsky </PERSON>. The city council will take up the issue at its June 14 meeting.

 Furniture, paintings and other items that belonged to the late <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> will be sold at auction next weekend, says an estate broker hired by the author's sons. The furniture is nicked and scratched, knobs are missing from a china cabinet and the frame is pulling away from an oil painting. Some pieces seem vintage garage sale. `` We're not talking a great deal of monetary value on these pieces,'' said <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Link </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> estate broker and antiques dealer who will conduct the sale at <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brokerage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Friday through Sunday. <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>, author of `` The Grapes of Wrath'' and the 1962 Nobel Prize winner, died in 1968. The sale has been commissioned by his sons, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 41, and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 43, who live in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> from 1979 to 1987, and his father's belongings remain stored there. The collection accounts for much of the author's estate, with the exception of some silver sold earlier and items kept by the family, according to <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>. The furniture and art is an eclectic mix, much of it American and Oriental. Acquired by the man whose works, such as `` Cannery Row'' and `` Of Mice and Men,'' were sympathetic to the common man, the items reflect <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s apparent casual attitude toward material possessions. A Chippendale corner cupboard normally would sell for about $ 3,000. Because it belonged to <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>, it probably will sell for about $ 5,500, <PERSON> Link </PERSON> said.

 The makers of the only drug approved for treatment of AIDS say that for nearly two years the medication has continued adding to the life spans of patients who have used, according to a published report. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> told an <ORGANIZATION> advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that even in long-term treatment the beneficial effects of azidothymidine, known as AZT or zidovudine, continue without an increase in negative side effects, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. An unidentified <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> official said the treatment `` adds at least six months'' but no study has yet documented how much time the drug adds to the life of AIDS patients. One study of 229 people with AIDS and severe AIDS-related complex found that 58 percent of those who received long-term treatment with the drug were alive after 21 months, while 50 percent of those who never received the treatment were dead after nine months, the company said. Another study of 4,800 people with AIDS and AIDS-related complex who received the drug between October 1986 and September 1987 found that 73 percent were alive 11 months after starting treatment. `` This is significantly better than what might be expected for such patients had they not been treated,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, vice president of research at <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has given writers, painters and other artists a reprieve on an partial exemption they had lost in the 1986 revision of the federal tax law. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> ruling on Friday will allow the group to deduct some of the expense of creating their works, even before the artwork or written work like a book begins to produce income. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said artists will be allowed to write off operating expenses over three years, with a 50 percent deduction permitted in the first year and 25 percent in each of the next two. The rule will apply, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said, only `` where the personal efforts of the individual are mainly responsible for the creation of a work of art.'' `` It certainly alleviates the complexity concern these people have had,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a tax counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` I guess 50 percent is better than nothing,'' said best-selling biographer <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, a leader in the fight to overturn the 1986 provision.

 A group of advocates for refugees in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should take the lead in stemming the `` drift into dissolution'' of people seeking asylum from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees, with strong support from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, also should call an international conference to highlight the issue said the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for Refugees. Unless the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government gives the problem new priority, it will be to blame for `` permitting a vital, humanitarian initiative to drift into dissolution,'' the group said. `` <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> lit the fuse in January, when it began to push back Vietnamese boats from its eastern and southern coastlines,'' committee director <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> added in a statement. `` What we are seeing now is the predictable chain reaction to bar asylum throughout the region,'' he said, citing increased resistance to temporary asylum on the part of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.

 A man who admits sneaking a cigarette in an airplane bathroom faces up to $ 4,000 in fines after becoming the first person accused of violating the new ban on smoking aboard short flights, officials said. `` He's not the first one to smoke on an airplane when they were n't supposed to, but he's the first person to be accused of breaking this new law,'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Elly </PERSON> <PERSON> Brekke </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Seigel </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> says he absent-mindedly began smoking inside the lavatory during a 100-minute Seattle-to-Reno flight on Thursday. `` It was an honest mistake,'' he said. A flight attendant spotted smoke coming from the lavatory after <PERSON> Seigel </PERSON> left it about 20 minutes into the flight, said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON>, spokesman for Reno Cannon Intenational Airport. The attendant asked <PERSON> Seigel </PERSON> if he knew about the federal law against smoking on domestic flights of two hours or less, and then told him he would be arrested when they landed. The flight attendant had explained the new law to passengers before the plane took off. Airport security detained <PERSON> Seigel </PERSON> for two hours for questioning at the request of the flight crew, <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON> said. Statements were taken Friday from the flight and maintenance crews aboard the <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> plane <PERSON> Seigel </PERSON> was flying in, <PERSON> Brekke </PERSON> said. The investigation should be completed within 60 days. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> faces three possible charges: Smoking when a no smoking sign is on, which carries a $ 1,000 fine; smoking in the lavatory, which also carries a $ 1,000 fine; and tampering with a lavatory smoke detector, which carries a $ 2,000 fine. The federal smoking ban on short flights went into effect April 23.

 About 35,000 suburban homes and businesses were without telephone service today because of a fire at a switching center, but about half probably will have intermittent dial tones by Sunday, officials said. It will take until at least June before all the customers in western suburbs will have full service, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Eibel </PERSON> said Friday. `` We could have as many as 21,000 lines up in <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> by the end of this week, but it's not going to be the standard of service that <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> wants to provide,'' <PERSON> Eibel </PERSON> said. `` That's my most optimistic view if everything absolutely goes right _ and, frankly, it will not,'' <PERSON> Eibel </PERSON> added. Technicians originally thought the digital switching device damaged by smoke and water in the fire Sunday could be repaired, but <PERSON> Eibel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> has decided to purchase a new one from AT & amp; T. There were no injuries in the fire. A telephone systems analyst told the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that such a switch could cost as much as $ 16 million. Meanwhile, State Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stange </PERSON> introduced a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution Friday calling for an investigation of the fire by a special legislative committee. `` It has devastated hundreds of businesses, many of which place catalog orders such as Spiegel and those which operate 800 numbers like Holiday Inn,'' <PERSON> Stange </PERSON> said. `` Our whole economy has been temporarily staggered. Gas stations, airports, hospitals, restaurants, delivery services, brokerage houses _ you name it _ all have suffered,'' <PERSON> Stange </PERSON> said.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> vowed not to give in to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that he step down as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military leader after claiming negotiations with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had fallen apart. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday, the White House said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials still were talking with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> about his resignation. But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s spokesman said the general would refuse any deal that includes a deadline for such a departure. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney prosecuting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug charges, meanwhile, sharply criticized the reported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer to throw out the charges in exchange for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation as <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief and at least temporary exile. Asked Friday about the talks, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said: `` Everything fell apart.'' Later, he said: `` The dignity of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is not negotiable while there are foreign troops on our territory, humiliating our soil, while there is economic aggression, as long as there are threats, as long as there is psychological war ... as long as -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> does not get out.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> spoke with reporters Friday at ceremonies in this rural town, 90 miles from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, on the anniversary of the death of a revolutionary hero, and during a meeting with local officials in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>, 60 miles southwest of the capital. Asked in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s comments, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` He says that all the time. He said ` fall apart' or something similar before. ... We are still talking. We are still negotiating.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been trying through economic sanctions to pressure <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> into stepping down since February, when he was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges. As military chief, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the country's de facto ruler. The general said Friday that <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but added: `` I have not talked with Mr. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>.'' Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s spokesman, said there was little variety in what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been offering. `` The thing is <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> comes each time with the same plan, the original plan a little more elastic,'' he said. `` The plan has a deadline for -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- resigning his post, a deadline for leaving the country ... With those conditions and that pressure neither the general nor any other Panamanian nor any Latin American will cede.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials acknowledged discussing with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> the possibility of dropping the drug charges in exchange for his departure from power. But Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on Friday argued against dismissing the drug charges, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, who obtained one of the indictments. <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said dropping the drug charges `` would send the wrong message'' to Americans. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, whose agency's investigation contributed to the drug indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, also said Friday that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should be prosecuted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s lawyers plan to appear in court to request dismissal of the drug charges in about a month. They contend the charges are politically motivated. In <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Negrita </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> did not address the crowd, but listened to three speeches by local authorities denouncing `` Yankee aggression.'' When a reporter asked if he could run for president in elections scheduled for next May, he smiled broadly. `` Legally, yes,'' he answered, surrounded by supporters. Asked if he was actively considering running for president, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> merely laughed. A `` dignity battalion'' of about 100 men attended the ceremony. They had vintage rifles and were dressed in blue jeans, T-shirts printed with `` not one step backward,'' and red-and-white baseball caps saying `` I do n't sell out my country.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, now in hiding, as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate president. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had him dismissed on Feb. 26, the day after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire the general.

<TEXT>
 Summer heat waves are deadlier for Northerners and Midwesterners than for Southerners, where almost no one dies when the mercury soars, a researcher says. The top six cities for weather-related deaths are <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. During an average summer, 183 people die in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> because of weather alone, <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it's 139 and in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, 118. The cities with the lowest weather-related death rates are southern areas: <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` In those three cities in an average summer season, almost no one dies'' from heat-related problems, <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON> said. When the temperature in a city exceeds a certain threshold, such as 92 degrees in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the number of people who die can increase by up to 50 percent, <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON> determined the threshold temperatures using a weather stress index in work funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. In a $ 225,000 study funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON> is looking at other aspects of weather's impact on human health, such as pollution and the effect of world temperatures that are expected to continue rising into the year 2060 The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has given <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON> scenarios for determining what will happen as temperatures go up. <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON> said, however, that the future heat-related death rate is uncertain because it's unknown whether people will acclimatize, or adjust to increasingly warm weather. `` We wonder if <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkers </LOCATION> will react like they do today or like people in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON> said. Assuming people do not adjust, if the temperature warms by 7 degrees, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would see an estimated 1,294 deaths instead of the current 139, said <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON>, who arrived at the figures by combining weather and death-rate data. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> would face 1,664 deaths instead of 183. In general, people adjust, so there is `` no real reason to believe they wo n't acclimatize in the future. But we're concerned that conditions might get so much warmer that it might be too much for humans to tolerate,'' <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON> said. As the Earth warms, <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON> said, there are other factors to consider, such as housing. `` <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> is the best example. Most inner-city people live in red brick houses with black roofs. Even if people acclimatize, those houses will be uninhabitable for humans'' because they will be too hot, he explained. People over age 65 were more stressed in hot weather than others, <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON> said. He determined that the elderly are generally more affected by hot, dry days, while younger people are more affected by hot, humid weather. The duration of hot weather appeared to have more effect on death rates than the intensity of the heat, <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON> said. `` In the summer, the kind of day that killed most people was not necessarily a day when it got very, very hot, but it got pretty hot and remained warm all day and all night,'' he said. The research also showed that heat waves in the beginning of the season had more impact on mortality than late-summer heat waves. `` By the time August comes around, -LRB- people -RRB- are used to heat,'' <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON> explained.

<TEXT>
 Teachers have a crucial role to play in fighting AIDS and can not only shape the lives of young people but `` actually save those lives,'' says the president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Children trust their teachers and they will go to their teachers for information. We must have factual information and know how to respond to young people,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, attending a three-day AIDS education conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> and the Centers for Disease Control. Educators at the conference are discussing patterns of AIDS infection among young people, problems teachers face in AIDS education, legal issues and other topics. `` Some will say ... ` Here you go again, getting involved in social issues,' but educators and students will not be immune'' from AIDS, Ms. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said in an interview Friday. Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> deputy director for AIDS, said the conference is aimed at helping teachers educate their students about the deadly disease. `` No one should die of ignorance,'' <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said. `` No child should reach the age of sexual maturity or experimentation with IV -LRB- intravenous -RRB- drugs without knowing about -LRB- AIDS virus -RRB- transmission. Teachers have a most unique opportunity to bring the facts out.'' The conference was addressed Friday by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an AIDS patient who is retired superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Brighton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We can put a stop to this plague. You have important roles in this task,'' <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>, 48, was diagnosed last spring with AIDS and publicly disclosed his illness in January. He then embarked on a series of appearances and speeches to educate high school and college students and teachers about the disease. <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> said he does not think he is being unfairly exploited as a gay man willing to talk openly about his illness. `` Exploit me,'' he said. `` My time is limited. I want to be exploited by whoever can use me to put windows on what is now happening with AIDS and what is likely to happen. `` My years in public school work have groomed me ... I'm not embarrassed by the questions.'' Other scheduled participants in the conference, which concludes Sunday, include officials and researchers of the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. Discussion will include ways to incorporate AIDS education into the existing school curriculum, to help young people avoid the virus which causes the disease. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s parent agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, created in 1987 to serve as a resource in the AIDS education effort. Last fall, the network distributed 1.9 million copies of a handbook for teachers, `` Facts About AIDS.'' Acquired immune deficiency syndrome has struck 973 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children under age 13; of those, 566 have died, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. In all, AIDS has struck more than 61,000 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, killing more than 34,000 of them so far.

<HEAD>After 27 Years, Zoo Atlanta's Famous Gorilla Walks Outside</HEAD>

 He was skeptical at first, a little suspicious, not sure what to make of grass, or trees, or sunshine. After all, he had n't seen those things in 27 years, since he was 3 years old. But <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON>, Zoo <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s star attraction, quickly grew on Friday to like his new home _ a $ 4.5 million outdoor `` rain forest'' where, finally, he will live like the Western lowland gorilla he is. As several dozen reporters, photographers and zoo staffers watched from behind trees and bushes and across protective moats, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> played his part perfectly at what was a coming-out _ both for him and for the once-beleaguered zoo where he lives. Just four years ago the zoo was declared one of the worst in the nation by the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Friday morning, as only a few zoo employees quietly watched, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> stepped out of his bad-weather shelter, walked around, felt rain, and ran back in. `` A very intelligent thing to do,'' pronounced a proud Zoo Atlanta Director <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Maple </PERSON>. Later, the door again was thrown open, and the great ape hopped out to meet his public. A minute later, he climbed back in. Another minute later, out again. Six minutes after that, a car horn sounded _ and he scampered back inside. All the while, his eyes darted back and forth, alert to the slightest movement or sound. But after 40 minutes, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> boldly climbed a small hill outside his door and picked up a few pieces of fruit thrown by his keeper. He heard peacocks, zoo construction trucks, an airplane, and car horns. And for the first time in 27 years, he felt the sunshine on his back. Within an hour, he was jumping in the air, trying to de-limb his first tree. The zoo director beamed. `` This is a very special moment,'' Maple said. `` I will always treasure this time. ... I'm delighted with the way he responded to the whole thing. It just could n't have been better.'' <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON>, named for former long-time <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartsfield </PERSON>, last month was moved from his tile-walled, steel-barred cage _ his home since he arrived at the zoo in May 1961 _ into the new indoor quarters he will use for sleep and shelter. After five weeks to grow accustomed to the enclosure, with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, his keeper of 14 years, often sleeping nearby to keep him company, zoo officials decided he was ready. Soon, he will live near _ but separated from _ 13 gorillas on loan from <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Zoo officials hope that within a year, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> can go on a date. `` We'll get a young, reproductive-proven female, hopefully one who could be seductive and friendly,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. `` A <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> of gorillas, to show him what to do.''

<HEAD>Hijackers Were Air Force Veterans, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Chinese men who hijacked a jetliner from the mainland to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> were air force veterans who had worked as radar operators, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said today. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> said it was weighing charges against the men. The report indicated that the hijackers' knowledge of air routes foiled an attempt by the pilot to fly the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> rather than land in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, seat of the rival Nationalist government. In <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, the country's chief security agency recommended today that the two hijackers be prosecuted. The <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> Garrison Command said the two violated <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s civil aviation code. If charged with hijacking, the men could face the death penalty. The air pirates, <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qingguo </PERSON>, 27, a worker at an arsenal in <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province, and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guiyin </LOCATION>, 26, a steelworker from <LOCATION> Guizhou </LOCATION> province, have been granted political asylum in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. They comandeered the plane Thursday about an hour after it left the southeast coastal city of <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> on a domestic flight. The plane, escorted by Taiwanese jet fighters, landed at <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s Qingquangan Air Force Base. It was refueled and flew back to <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION>, 136 miles across the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION>, to end the nine-hour ordeal for the 105 passengers and 11 crew members aboard. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> and Long first overpowered the plane's security guard with a dagger and what appeared to be a gun. They wrapped the chief flight attendant, who tried to set off an alarm, and another attendant in a cotton curtain and threatened to blow up the plane with explosives. After entering the cockpit, they covered the heads of the radio operator and co-pilot with plastic bags, it said. An earlier report by the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the hijackers covered the head of the pilot, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongling </PERSON>, and told him they had guns and knives. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> later told a television interviewer in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> that he had a toy pistol and fake explosives. As the plane entered <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> air space, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> tried to trick the hijackers and land there, but the two realized his ploy and forced him to continue toward <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily said. In <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, officials said the director of the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> Garrison Command's court martial division had recommended that the hijackers be prosecuted for endangering flight safety, a charge that carries a maximum penalty of 7 years in jail. Command officials refused to say whether the mroe severe charge of hijacking might also apply. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-yi </PERSON>, presiding judge at the <ORGANIZATION> Taipei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters the court would consider the charge with compassion because of the hijackers' motives. The garrison command delivered to the court a statement by the two hijackers, saying they hijacked the plane because they detested the `` brutal rule of the Chinese communists'' and wanted to seek freedom in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. It was the second time a commercial Chinese airliner was hijacked to outside the mainland. Six Chinese commandeered a Trident owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in May 1983. They were imprisoned in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for a little more than a year, then released and allowed to go to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>.

 The dispute over a 10-year-old Bible-quoting schoolyard preacher, who was suspended a fourth time after he refused to stop proselytizing and go to class, will wind up in court, his mother says. `` It's gone too far now,'' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said Friday after her son, <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON>, received his fourth suspension from <ORGANIZATION> Eastfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in this tiny town in the <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> of western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, surrounded by dozens of reporters, stood in the school parking lot Friday morning, ignoring requests from Assistant Principal <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> that he stop preaching and come in out of the rain. He accused onlookers of various sins. `` Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain!'' <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> shouted. `` Thou shalt not commit adultery! You're guilty! Even your eyes are filled with adultery! Men ca n't keep their eyes off women and women ca n't keep their eyes off men. Adulterers shall be put to death and their blood shall be upon them!'' After several minutes, Mrs. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> left <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> standing on the sidewalk and went into the school. After talking to his mother, he entered the building to hand in some homework. Five minutes later, the boy emerged, carrying a letter of suspension. The letter did not mention preaching, but said <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> was suspended for 10 days for being insubordinate, refusing to abide by school policies, refusing to accompany Mrs. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> into the school and disruptive behavior. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> appeared unrepentent. `` I'd rather get gold and silver up in heaven than an education down here,'' he said. `` This thing's going to court,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said. She said she has contacted an attorney through the <ORGANIZATION> Rutherford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which she described as a non-profit Christian legal foundation based in <LOCATION> Manassass </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, 5, and sister, Pepper, 6, also were suspended for defying school officials earlier this month Mrs. <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said they probably will be suspended again when they return to school Thursday. `` I told them if they want to go back and preach, that's fine,'' she said in an interview at the family's home. Mrs. Strode blames the family's problems on school officials. `` They are the ones who are keeping my children from getting an education,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said the Strode children could return to school Monday if they would agree to stop shouting Bible verses on school grounds. She said expulsion was unlikely since the school year was almost over. But Mrs. <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> said she could n't guarantee <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> would quit preaching. `` I just leave that up to him, and if he wants to preach, I'll back him 100 percent,'' she said `` And if he does n't, that's fine, too.'' Earlier, when asked if he felt pressured by parents, <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> had said, `` No. They ai n't. I want to do it.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> has underscored his efforts to make Islam the state religion by ordering members of the armed forces to offer five prayers a day. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said Friday that the prayers are now compulsory for <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s 150,000 servicemen because they had `` taken the pledge to defend the sovereignty and independence of the country by putting their hands on the holy Koran,'' the Moslem equivalent of the Bible. About 90 percent of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s 105 million people are Moslems. Hindus, Christians and Buddhists serving in the armed forces are exempted from the mandatory prayers, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The five daily prayers, which are recited while facing Mecca, are one of the five main duties of the Islamic faith. The government on Wednesday introduced legislation to make Islam the state religion. Since <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> holds 251 of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s 300 seats, the bill is expected to be approved. Opposition politicians, women's groups and professional associations have denounced the legislation, saying it could cause friction among religions and curtail women's rights. Major opposition parties are not represented in Parliament. They boycotted the March 3 elections, because they refuse to participate in a government headed by <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>. The opposition has been campaigning since Nov. 10 for the ouster of the former army general, who seized power in 1982. He later was elected president in a vote that was marked by charges of flagrant misconduct.

 Six army officers have been arrested and eight civilians implicated in a failed attempt to topple the civilian government of President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>, the army said. Three other officers were suspended or ordered to retire for their involvement in Wednesday's attempted coup, the army said in a comminque Friday. Troops loyal to the government stopped columns of soldiers who were moving toward the capital Wednesday from bases at <LOCATION> Jutiapa </LOCATION>, 75 miles southeast of the capital, and <LOCATION> Retalhuleu </LOCATION>, 115 miles southeast of here. No shots were fired and the insurgents returned to their bases, officials said. No details were given on the size of the rebel force. The communique said the arrests and forced retirements `` are the first actions of an administrative and legal nature applied to re-establish army discipline'' after Wednesday's uprising. The army communique did not identify the civilians implicated in the uprising, but said they included three former officers. `` The ex-officials are in retirement for having been expelled earlier from the institution due to lack of morality and discipline,'' the communique said. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday said only that the civilians did not include leaders of the country's 14 legally registered political parties. He said his government would take legal action against them, but did not identify those allegedly involved. The communique listed those under arrest as Cols. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cifuentes </PERSON> <PERSON> Dardoon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Neftali </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Garavito </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>; Maj. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martiinez </PERSON>; and reserve Lt. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cifuentes </PERSON> <PERSON> Dardon </PERSON> was a deputy commander of the Jutiapa base and <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> was a deputy commander of the Retalhuleu base. Suspended without pay were aviation Lt.

He declined to comment further on what other actions the department might be considering. The death prompted several mental-health advocacy groups to accuse the department of chronic underfunding and understaffing of its facilities. But <PERSON> Devane </PERSON> said hospital staff members checked the 34-year-old woman before she had given birth, about 15 minutes before the infant was found in the toilet. Staff members found the child after they saw blood on the mother's leg, he said. An autopsy showed the newborn had drowned.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> has purchased full-page newspaper ads apologizing for a student's painting of the late Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> in frilly women's underwear. The painting, titled `` Mirth and Girth,'' was seized by a group of black aldermen last week who stormed the school's halls and was later confiscated by police. While the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> prepared its apology, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> threatened a lawsuit on artist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s behalf, and discord over the black aldermen's seizure of the painting led to angry words exchanged in the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and its school _ where the painting was shown briefly in a private, juried student show _ plan to run full-page advertisements in three daily Chicago-area newspapers offering an apology for the caricature of the city's first black mayor, who died of a heart attack in November. `` It contains an apology for the distress and concern that the painting caused to the community,'' <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Harakal </PERSON> said of the ad, which will run in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION>, and in Monday editions of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defender </ORGANIZATION>, which has a primarily black readership. `` We would like to see calm in the community,'' she said Friday. `` We never intended for there to be any unrest in the first place and want to put the entire incident behind us and move on.'' Ms. <PERSON> Harakal </PERSON> refused to release the text of the ad before publication. The <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and its school came under fire Wednesday, when aldermen began receiving telephone complaints about the work by <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution cutting off city funds for a school program unless the painting was removed and demanded an apology. The black aldermen then stormed the school and removed the painting. The painting was returned to <LOCATION> Nelson </LOCATION> Thursday, defaced with a 5-inch gash on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s left shoulder, after the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> intervened with the city corporation counsel, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director. The organization is considering a lawsuit seeking monetary damages from police for violating the artist's civil rights, he said. Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, who succeeded <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he was disgusted by the work. `` It should never have been hung. In fact, it should never have been painted.'' Several white aldermen complained Friday that black colleagues had overreacted. `` The whole thing could have been resolved with a phone call,'' said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>. `` Now, by going to the council floor and grandstanding on the issue, millions of people will have seen this sad, insensitive, disgusting picture, as opposed to a few dozen.'' But at a meeting of black ministers Friday, the Rev. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>, executive director of Operation PUSH, the civil rights group founded by Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, described the painting as `` the latest in a series of escalating attacks and insults against the black community.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, received dozens of calls Friday from people supporting an artist's right to show his work, Ms. <PERSON> Harakal </PERSON> said. Students said they had consulted attorneys about filing a civil rights lawsuit against the aldermen and police for impounding the painting.

<TEXT>
 Government forces fired at the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> today after seizing surrounding buildings and tightening their grip on the shrine, where militant Sikh separatists were holed up for a sixth day. Sikh extremists and government commandos traded intermittent fire through the night inside the sprawling temple complex, home of the Sikh faith's holiest sanctuary. At least 27 people, mostly Sikh militants, have been killed during the siege that began Monday. About 20 women and children, thought to be relatives of the militants, remain in the temple, <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> Police Chief K.P.S. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said. Government forces on Friday seized about one-third of the complex, including adjacent temple offices and a hostel. That left the militants with the equivalent of 3 -LCB- city blocks, including the temple. The extremists inside the temple complex are thought to number fewer than 100. Police sharpshooters killed at least six militants Friday, including one who tried to shoot his way out of the complex. Police said no government troops have been killed since the siege began. About 2,800 troops are posted outside the temple. Most of the militants are believed to be entrenched at the western side of the complex, officers said. But they said any government assault would more likely come from the west, officers said. `` The eastern side is difficult to enter because terrorists are still holding two 80-foot towers overlooking that entrance,'' said a paramilitary officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. Authorities escorted journalists to a sandbagged position atop a buildimg overlooking the towers today. In a two-hour period, government troops regularly fired machine gun bursts into the temple compound, but only sporadic shots were returned. S.D.S. Aswal, deputy superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said the Sikhs did not fire from the tower in daylight because that would give away their position: `` They start firing from portholes cut into the tower after late evening.'' The bunker had a commanding view of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> and the sacred pool that surrounds it. One body was seen lying near a marble walkway. In the square facing the compound's main entrance, cane-wielding police charged at a group of Sikhs who attempted to march into the temple. At least eight marchers were arrested, said witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity. The siege is the biggest massing of forces outside the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> since June 1984, when the army stormed the 400-year-old shrine to dislodge the Sikh militants. More than 1,200 people were killed, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who ordered the raid, was assassinated five months later by her Sikh bodyguards. Sikh militants have waged a campaign of violence, often gunning down whole family of Hindus and moderate Sikhs, in their battle to establish a Sikh homeland in northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, which includes <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. Although Sikhs form only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s total population, they are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The Sikhs say they are discriminated against by <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON>, who comprise 82 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people.

<HEAD>UAW: Contracts Stand As-is Despite Skilled Trades Rejection</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>' contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will stand despite a narrow rejection by skilled trades workers of a pact ratified by a majority of 66,000 union members, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> leaders say. `` The International Executive Board after reviewing all the issues ... has determined that this contract stands properly ratified,'' the union said Friday in a statement attributed to <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>. The contract was ratified by 54 percent of the vote Wednesday. Skilled trades workers, who have an additional, separate contract but cast a single vote for or against both pacts, narrowly rejected it. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> says it has about 10,500 active skilled trades workers. Delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s 140-member national <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> council who represent skilled trades workers met in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Friday with <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> and other union leaders to determine whether negotiations should resume. The union and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> could have returned to the bargaining table to discuss skilled trades issues if those had been behind the rejection. However, if the rejection was on issues in the main contract, such as economics, then the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> would take no further action. The union's decision indicated that the rejection concerned the main contract. Union officials had said before the meeting that they believed the rejection was economic, and blamed it on a $ 1,000 signing bonus. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers received a $ 2,120 bonus in 1985 for signing a three-year contract. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> executive board, which includes <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>, other <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> vice presidents and regional directors, decided to ratify the contract after receiving a report on the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> meeting. The contracts, reached May 5 after 2 -LCB- weeks of early negotiations, cover 66,000 hourly and salaried <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers in 15 states.

 A man was convicted of murder in an attack on a 65-year-old woman who was raped and robbed before being tied to a bed and burned to death. A Superior Court jury deliberated less than two days before pronouncing <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Alhambra </LOCATION>, guilty Friday of one count each of murder, rape, arson and robbery in the Feb. 7, 1986, assault on <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Litovitch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> faces either a life sentence in prison without parole or the death penalty, Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Weis </PERSON> said. A separate hearing will be held to determine the jury's sentencing recommendation. <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> also was convicted of nine other felonies, including robbery, burglaries and kidnappings that occurred from Feb. 5 to Feb. 7, <PERSON> Weis </PERSON> said. Evidence presented by the prosecutor showed that <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> broke into <PERSON> Litovich </PERSON>'s home during the afternoon and sexually assaulted her. After tying her to the posts of a bed, he attempted to strangle her, breaking her neck, then poured a flammable liquid over the bed and set it ablaze.

<TEXT>
 A bomb exploded inside a truck today near reviewing stands being prepared for farewell ceremonies to mark the retreat of Soviet soldiers. Eleven Afghans were killed and 12 reported wounded. The blast occurred in the heart of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> at 5:45 a.m. -LRB- 9:15 p.m. EDT Friday -RRB- in a housing area on the banks of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. A Western photographer on the scene told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that a baby and 11-year-old girl were among those killed and all the casualties were Afghan civilians. Most appeared to have been occupants of nearby homes destroyed by the impact of the explosion, he said. `` When the bomb exploded some of the houses nearby just collapsed.'' Witnesses said they saw four bodies being removed from one house. The blast was so great that it shattered the windows of a bus depot across the river, 300 yards away and left a crater 20 feet wide and 10 feet deep. Soviet troops arrived afterward, the photographer said by telephone. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevruk </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s propaganda department, also provided casualty figures to foreign reporters covering the pullout, which is to begin Sunday. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that the blast killed 11 people and wounded 13 and blamed `` Afghan anti-government formations.'' The explosion demolished embankment walls on both sides of the river, which threads through this ancient capital city, whose streets are now filled with Soviet troops, tanks and armored personnel carriers. Blood was visible on the gates of a nearby factory and personal belongings, including carpet slippers, were scattered in the street. Witnesses said flames were visible when they arrived shortly after the blast. The bomb had been planted in a large truck that was badly mangled. Last month, six people were killed and 49 wounded in another bomb blast along the river banks on the 10th anniversary of the April 1978 revolution that brought a Marxist government to power and triggered widespread insurrection. Anti-Communist guerrillas also were blamed for a May 4 attack on a Soviet convoy north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that killed a photographer for the Soviet newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> and an undisclosed number of soldiers. It also wounded <PERSON> Sevruk </PERSON>'s son, who also works for <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the Soviet-allied government put down the insurrection. About 115,000 Soviets have been assisting <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s troops, but they will begin leaving the country on Sunday in observance of a peace agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on April 14. Half of the Soviets must be out by Aug. 15, and the rest are expected to follow quickly, although the accord gives them nine months to complete the pullout. At a new conference today, the head of the Soviet military contingent in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said the guerrilas were taking their toll on Soviet and Afghan troops, but that rebel attacks would not deter the withdrawal. `` The opposition may have some effect on us, but not much, and certainly they will not be able to frustrate the timetable,'' Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> told reporters. Troops manning the Soviet armor in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have been setting out gasoline pumps and supplies along the route of retreat. For security reasons, Soviet officials have been tight-lipped about the exact number of troops who will begin the move north on Sunday. The Soviet national news program Vremya reported Friday night that soldiers were ready for the withdrawal, but gave no figures. Vremya reported that 167 Soviet encampments would be left behind for the Afghans to use, but that some of the facilities would be put to civilian use as hospitals and schools. Information for this account was based in part on a news agency pool report from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> and on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> monitoring of Soviet news broadcasts. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> was not allowed to go on the trip to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> because of questions it asked <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> in the capital last month.

 The army reopened the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today after a 29-hour closing imposed to prevent Palestinians from reaching <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> for prayers marking the last Sabbath of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, the Moslem holy month. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> strip's Shati refugee camp, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers opened fire to disperse stone-throwing demonstrators, wounding a 16-year-old Palestinian in the leg, said doctors at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> Three Arabs suffered beating injuries. The army said it was checking the report. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders orchestrating the Arab protests in the occupied lands allowed stores to open for several hours this morning in most areas of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The move allowed residents to stock up for the three-day holiday marking the end of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> next week. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, Palestinian youths burned tires in the main street at noon, a signal to the merchants that it was time to close again, said an Arab reporter who spoke on condition of anonymity. At <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s sacred mosque complex, hundreds of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> worshipers protesting <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation battled riot police after <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> prayers Friday, leaving 20 Arabs and four policemen injured. Nineteen Arabs were arrested. Police firing rubber bullets stormed the complex after protesters threw stones, chanted nationalist slogans and burned <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flags. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag also was set ablaze. About 3,300 police officers have been deployed in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> since Thursday to maintain order during <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> prayers. Authorities said the beefed-up force would remain at least through Sunday, the 40th anniversary of the founding of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and also Jerusalem Day, when Israelis mark the anniversary of the capture of <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in 1967. The army freed 281 Palestinian prisoners Friday in a holiday gesture. Still imprisoned are more than 4,500 Arabs arrested since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the lands <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The army recently released from prison about 100 youths between the ages of 14 and 16, leaving only a few in that age group in custody, army <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> commander Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> Friday. He said no prisoners were younger than 14. About 15,000 Moslem worshipers attended <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> prayers Friday at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>. Last year's attendance was 200,000. The numbers were drastically reduced after the army sealed off <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> Thursday night, barring the coastal strip's 650,000 residents from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Roadblocks also prevented most of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s 850,000 Palestinians from reaching <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. After prayers in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, about 1,000 worshipers marched around the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, chanting `` Jews out'', `` We do n't want to see any Zionists'' and `` No fear, no fear. The stone is better than the Kalashnikov -LRB- rifle -RRB-.'' A few hundred youths hurled stones at the police station facing the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aqsa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosque </ORGANIZATION> there. Seconds later, about 100 helmeted riot police carrying clubs and assault rifles charged the complex, firing rubber bullets into the crowd. Hospital officials said they treated 20 Arabs for rubber bullet injuries, and police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said four police officers were slightly hurt by hurled stones. At least 10 injured Arabs were carried across the complex on stretchers. An elderly <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, blood streaming down his face, shouted ` God is great' and flashed a victory sign. Four or five women were also carried out on stretchers. During the two-hour clash, many worshipers remained inside the mosque, afraid to leave. The Moslem prayer leader appealed to police through loudspeakers to withdraw. Residents in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and neighboring refugee camps remained confined to their homes for a second day today. The army imposed the curfew after receiving `` warnings that people in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> planned disturbances,'' <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> city of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, soldiers fired rubber bullets at a car that crashed through an army roadblock Friday, and an Arab passenger was struck in the eye, the army said. Army officials have said more than 1,400 Arabs have been injured in the uprising, along with 298 soldiers and 172 Israeli settlers. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> lists 187 Arabs and two Israelis killed since Dec. 8.

 Pro-Iranian fundamentalists today attacked the last stronghold of their Syrian-backed rivals in the city's southern slums, where the two factions have waged a bloody duel for control since May 6. Police said six people were killed and 13 wounded in today's inter-Shiite Moslem fighting, lifting the nine-day toll to 204 killed and 574 wounded In other fighting today in the southern neighborhoods, <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s loyalist guerrillas and Syrian-backed adversaries traded mortar and artillery fire at the <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> el-Barajneh refugee camp. Police said three people were killed and 11 wounded in the fighting between <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and rebels led by Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>. There was no word on what started the fighting at the refugee camp, where billows of smoke rose from the gunfire. The intense battles in the area, where the pro-Syrian Amal and the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> were also fighting, kept reporters out. A police spokesman said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> launched a pre-dawn assault on the <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION> district, seeking to dislodge Amal of its last stronghold in the area. The thuds of exploding shells echoed across west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as the two factions battled with heavy artillery, mortar and tank fire. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that its fighters were advancing into <PERSON> Shiyah </PERSON>. Amal spokesmen said the assault was repulsed and that a counter-attack was launched to retake positions captured by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Police said they were unable to verify the claims. The two groups were fighting in a 16-square-mile enclave where most of the 18 foreign hostages were believed held by kidnappers affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. The Beirut-based weekly magazine <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> said Friday the hostages had been moved from an exposed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> barracks to the home of <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Amin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman, in a less vulnerable neighborhood. <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> was first to report in November 1986 on the secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> made in an effort to free the hostages, who include nine Americans. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, meanwhile, escalated its war of words with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. A ranking Syrian official said, `` <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has become an aberration on the Lebanese scene. `` This phenomenon is destabilizing tranquility and warrants immediate and drastic treatment,'' the official told the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> radio without elaborating. The broadcast did not identify the official. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, maintains 25,000 troops in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> and in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Though <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has been alarmed by <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s attempt through <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> to dominate <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites Police estimate <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has 3,000 combatants fighting <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, which has thrown some 6,500 militiamen into the battle. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> also said <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s military headquarters on the main <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> highway were overrun during the night. Amal denied the claim. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s snipers killed a Syrian on the airport highway on Friday and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> soldiers fired back, killing five <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters. It was the first time that the Syrians directly intervened in the fighting, which falls outside their jurisdiction.

 Ex-president <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> today pledged support for President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and told his followers not to stage a new coup. About 5,000 people rallied to demand the ousted leader's return. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> also asked Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to allow him to return to bury his 95-year-old mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, who died May 4. On Friday, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> claimed he was negotiating with <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to return for the funeral and he expected the talks to be finalized in a few days. There was no immediate comment from the government to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' latest statement, broadcast by <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> radio stations Earlier today, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s spokesman said the imminent return of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was `` impossible.'' `` I ... reiterate that I oppose violence, that I have no intention of mounting a coup d'etat or causing a civil war,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said in a statement read by telephone from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> by his spokesman Gemmo <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>. `` Instead let us join forces with <PERSON> Madame </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> so that the communists and some rebel bands would not venture to commit acts of adventurism to challenge the stability of the current government.'' In another statement issued Friday by his followers, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said he hoped an agreement on his return could be reached `` in a day or two.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON>, branded the statement meaningless. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> told reporters that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials `` just have n't been involved at all'' in negotiations regarding <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return. Meanwhile, a bomb exploded near sundown today at military headquarters, killing one soldier, officials said. The building has been vacant since being set ablaze during an August coup attempt. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Anselmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabingan </PERSON>, a military spokesman, said the victim was believed to be a member of a roving guard force and may have picked up an explosive device left after the coup plot failed. `` It's an accident,'' <PERSON> Cabingan </PERSON> said. `` It ` s not connected with anything political or whatever. It's just a simple accident as we see it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, citing national security, has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return for his mother's funeral. <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> said the decision was unanimously endorsed by the Cabinet. `` There is nothing that should cause worry, excitement or nervousness on our people about reports that ex-president <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> will return,'' <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> said. `` There is no truth to that.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters gathered today under a blistering sun in a downtown square and marched to the <LOCATION> Mendiola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> about 300 yards from the presidential palace. March leader <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Panelo </PERSON> said they would remain there until Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> reversed her decision or <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> appeared before them. Police agreed to allow the estimated 5,000 protesters to remain there as long as the protest was peaceful. About 200 riot police, backed by four water cannon and four firetrucks, guarded the approach to the palace. Protesters waved banners reading `` Give Us <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> or Give Us Death,'' while others claimed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was the only one who could stop the Communist insurgency, which erupted and spread nationwide during <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 20-year rule. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters have been linked to several attempts to topple the Aquino government. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in February 1986 after a popular uprising. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in an interview Friday that he would support the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> government if he were allowed to return. `` My mother is dead and I'd like to go home,'' he said in slow, somewhat slurred speech from his home in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` I will support the Aquino government to prevent any adventurism or prevent any attempt at the takeover by the communists.'' `` There is nothing that Madame Aquino should fear from me,'' he said. `` I mean well. And if I should be any obstacle, we will be able to work it out.'' The body of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' mother has been lying in state at a suburban church since her death. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters say she will be buried in northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> but have given no firm date for the funeral or for the body to be taken north. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> barred <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from leaving <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> without permission after the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> government claimed he had chartered a plane in January 1987 to return home if a coup attempt succeeded.

<TEXT>
 Student protesters today hurled rocks and firebombs as police set off barrages of tear gas to break up a march advocating reunification talks with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries. The march broke off from a rally of about 10,000 students from universities around the country who gathered at <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Some prominent dissident leaders, including the Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON>, attended the rally. Relatives of hundreds of jailed dissidents also participated. The students, many wearing headbands reading `` unification,'' also asked the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo to make concessions to persuade <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to join the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympic Games in the fall. In a separate statement, the demonstrators proposed that student leaders of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> meet on June 10 to discuss national unification and the Olympic co-hosting. Unification of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> has emerged as a major campus issue as radical students shifted their anti-government strategy after legislative elections last month, when the opposition made a strong showing. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it would boycott the Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> unless it is allowed to co-host the Games. After the campus rally, about 5,000 students walked out of the school to begin what they called `` a grand peace march'' to headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. When the marchers went 1,000 yards, about 2,000 riot police intervened, pushing the students to both sides of the street. Some students responded by throwing rocks. Many protesters were forced back to the school, where they began throwing hundreds of firebombs and rocks over the fence. Police retaliated with tear gas.

 American trumpeter <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a jazz virtuoso who found fame in the 1950s but whose career was haunted by heroin addiction, died in a fall from the second floor of his hotel. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who was 59, took heroin just before he fell from the hotel window shortly after 3:10 a.m. Friday, police spokesman <PERSON> Klaas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilting </PERSON> said today. Authorities found <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> dead in the street. Wilting said suicide was possible. But <ORGANIZATION> Ria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wigt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wigt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s worldwide agent, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> `` was n't the type of man'' who would commit suicide. Born <PERSON> Chesney </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Yale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, in 1929, the musician set the standard for what jazz buffs knew as the `` cool school.'' In 1952, he was working with <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> when he joined the piano-less quartet of British saxophonist <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>. With his good looks and youth and fragile, introverted tone, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> soon became a cult figure. In 1953, he topped the Metronome trumpet poll and started his own quartet. His work became more assured and outgoing. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> looked something like actor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> and sounded something like famed jazz trumpeter <PERSON> Bix </PERSON> <PERSON> Beiderbecke </PERSON>. As a player, <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was his main inspiration. In 1955, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> took a group to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that showed high promise. Then his career started to suffer. An Italian court sentenced him to a 16-month prison term in 1960 for drug possession. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in 1968, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he was beaten up by hoodlums and suffered severe injuries that included the loss of his teeth, a trumpet player's nightmare. For two years <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> did n't play, but he said recently he had quit drugs. He began recording again and made an album with pop star <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>. In 1974, critic <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> wrote in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had developed `` more range and assertiveness within the wistfully ruminative style with which he has also been associated.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had scheduled several appearances in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> as part of a tour that also included <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. He had been staying at the <PERSON> Prins </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrik </PERSON> hotel close to <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s drug district, said Wilting. `` The way it looks, he had just been using'' heroin, Wilting told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Traces of heroin use were found in <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s hotel room, he added. `` Maybe he started acting funny,'' said Wilting. `` He was alone and shoved the window open himself and either fell or jumped out _ I do n't suppose we'll ever find out which.'' A receptionist at the hotel, where <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> checked in Thursday, said the musician `` was a little nervous'' when he arrived. He did not elaborate. The receptionist, who refused to give his name, said the window of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s room slides open vertically, leaving a 10-inch gap at most. `` How he got through there I do n't know,'' the receptionist said. `` He must have been dead straight away,'' he said. The hotel official said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> showed no signs of drug abuse.

 <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes today attacked and set ablaze five ships, including two of the world's largest supertankers, at an offshore oil-loading terminal that belongs to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, shipping executives reported. One ship was reported sinking and 20 crew members were reported missing. An Iranian jet fighter was overheard by radio monitors as it warned an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warship to stay away from the area, said the executives, who spoke on condition they not be identified. A large number of Iranian salvage tugboats were reported battling fierce flames aboard the Liberian-flag, 564,739-ton Seawise Giant, the world's biggest ship, from which oil was leaking. The executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they received the information from ships in the vicinity. Thirty-six members of the Seawise Giant's 50-member crew were evacuated while the crew of the four other vessels had abandoned ship, the sources said. It appeared the other 14 from the Seawise Giant were missing. The 457,841-ton <ORGANIZATION> Burmah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endeavour </ORGANIZATION>, a British-flag vessel that also ranks among the world's five largest vessels, was the least damaged. But radio communication indicated two crew members were missing, sources said. Both the Seawise Giant and the Burmah Endeavour are used as `` motherships'' or oil storage depots. The sources said the Spanish-flag 235,000-ton <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>, which was taking on cargo from the Seawise Giant, was sinking as a result of the attack. Four Spanish crewmen were missing and 26 were rescued, said the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> national news agency <ORGANIZATION> EFE </ORGANIZATION>, quoting London-based <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>. The other two stricken vessels were the 231,712-ton Iranian tanker <PERSON> Khark </PERSON> and the 152,004-ton Cypriot ship <ORGANIZATION> Argosy </ORGANIZATION>, both shuttle tankers used by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to carry oil down the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Larak </PERSON>. The sources said these were still aflame, but damage was not severe. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said `` large numbers'' of jets took part in the rare long-range raid and all returned safely to base. An air raid siren sounded at <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> around 1:05 p.m. -LRB- 5:05 a.m. EDT -RRB- as <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes made one of their rare long-range raids on Larak, at the northern end of the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the gulf's gateway The Seawise Giant also was hit in Iraqi raids last year, once in October and again in December. The huge vessel is chartered by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s government-owned oil company as a floating storage depot for oil at the Larak terminal. It was not known whether the Burmah Endeavour was serving as a similiar role or picking up an oil cargo. Most of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil customers pick up shipments from <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION>. The Iranians use a special fleet of chartered tankers to shuttle crude to <PERSON> Larak </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> terminal in the northeastern gulf. <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION>, 350 miles from <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION>, is in the Iraqi-declared exclusion zone, where ships entering are susceptible to attack. Shipping sources said the Iranians apparently warned off a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship when it tried to move closer to <PERSON> Larak </PERSON> to check out the situation. The unidentified American ship was not heard to reply, and radios afterward were silent, the sources said. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had monitored a radio message from an Iranian F-4 Phantom jet `` requesting permission to attack a ship.'' There was no American vessel in the area at the time, and there was no indication of what ship was referred to, the source said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships are now permitted to intervene on request in attacks on neutral shipping as well as to provide `` humanitarian aid'' to non-U.S. flag vessels, but only in international waters. Today's attack occurred inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s territorial waters. The Iraqis have recently intensifed air raids on tankers plying Iranian waters as part of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s bid to throttle the vital oil exports that help <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> finance the 7 -LCB- - year-old war The <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> High Command has claimed nine air raids on `` large maritime targets,'' meaning ships, off <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s coast in the past two weeks. Three have been confirmed by <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>. Iraqi attacks mainly are directed at tankers in Iranian waters closer to <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION>, and sometimes off <LOCATION> Lavan </LOCATION> island, a terminal in the central gulf. Iraqi air forays against <PERSON> Larak </PERSON>, which would necessitate midair refueling of the jets, are rare.

 Praise for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and a talk on party unity from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> helped calm troubled waters between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Democratic presidential front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> continued to withhold his endorsement of either man. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, campaigned at a defense plant in <LOCATION> Fullerton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where he called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' views on defense `` naive at best'' and warned they `` would be dangerous.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent much of Friday fending off attacks from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, suggesting his Democratic rival's call for a big spending increase for education `` does n't make any sense'' in the face of federal budget deficits. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> emerged Friday from a 1 -LCB- - hour private meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> needed him `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> needs <PERSON> Reverand </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for his personal input, for his personal capacity, for his ability to deal with the issues intelligently _ not just to articulate them, which he does with eloquence and effectiveness, but understanding the issues, especially questions of foreign policy,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said at a fund-raiser for a local congressional candidate. But <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who eliminated himself as a possible presidential contender last month during his state's sometimes rancorous primary, also praised <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` a man of great intelligence, great sensitivity and great practicality.'' The balancing act helped <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> keep an earlier promise not to endorse any candidate until after the June 7 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary, where 336 delegates to the national convention are at stake. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> immediately praised <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s stand on an endorsement, saying that `` waiting until after June 7 is the appropriate thing to do. That was the governor's commitment, and he has remained true to his position.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> put in an appearance earlier Friday at a drug treatment center in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has made fighting drugs a primary theme of his campaign, criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for not putting forth `` a comprehensive plan.'' And in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> compared <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying: `` Like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> almost brags about putting forth no plans. Like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says I have not said anything concrete to anybody about anything.'' `` We fundamentally are on the same side of history,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> later, muting his criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> following his meeting with <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain Republican nominee, told the crowd of defense plant workers: `` The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> doctrine is the doctrine of wishful thinking. And it is bad thinking.'' `` The Soviets ... respect only strength. To think that they would agree to cuts in their strategic and conventional arsenals in the face of unilateral <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> abandonment of major weapons programs is the height of folly.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also went on the offensive on the environmental issue. `` I want to make the environment a Republican issue,'' he told a cheering crowd of about 800 Republicans at a rally in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. `` I would like to be remembered the same way as <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> _ next to the national security, it's the condition of the Earth that you will leave to generations to come. We can do better.'' Meanwhile, a pollster for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Friday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faces an uphill battle against likely <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in November because of growing national pessimism about the country's future <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON>, in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said a national survey he completed last month for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> found that polls showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are accurate. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is behind at this point,'' <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON> said. `` I do n't believe he is in a hole that he ca n't get out of, but he has a major task ahead. <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON>, who has advised <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for eight years, worked for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s early political season rival, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to visit a tree nursery near <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, today; take a raft trip Sunday and visit a tree research lab in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s accusation that he is too vague, pointing to his record as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. `` It will come as a surprise to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if my views on the world and my style of political leadership has any similarity to his. One of the things I have is a record. People do n't have to guess about it,'' he said. Speaking to about 200 students at <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Daly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in a suburb of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> warned against illegal drugs and called for increased public emphasis on education. His wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, told students of her own 26-year dependency on diet pills. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also hit back at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> on education. `` You ca n't go around talking about $ 20 billion more for public education out of the federal budget when you've got a $ 170 billion deficit. That does n't make any sense,'' he said. `` You've got to pick your priorities and pick them carefully.''

 They turn out faithfully to wave banners and chant slogans for their exiled leader's return, but supporters of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> are dwindling, and some of his former champions believe the ousted president is history. The death May 4 of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, revived the spirits of his die-hard followers. They have transformed her wake into an ongoing rally to demand that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 70, be allowed to return from exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> for the funeral. `` Give Us <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> or Give Us Death,'' read the banners in downtown <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on Saturday as thousands rallied to demand the ousted leader's return. Nearly 10,000 <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters turned out Wednesday for a noisy rally and vowed to camp near President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s residence until she changed her mind and allowed their leader to come home. But most of the crowd drifted away in the hot summer night, even before the 4 a.m. deadline imposed by the military for them to disperse. More than two years after a popular uprising drove <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from power, thousands of Filipinos still long for the return of the `` Apo,'' or the `` grand old man,'' who dominated Philippine politics for two decades. But most Filipinos do n't expect, let alone want, him to return to power. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> refused to let <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> come home for his mother's funeral, citing his continued threat to national security in the wake of several attempts to topple her `` Another fact that the loyalists would have to accept is that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is already part of history and that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is president of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, for better or worse, until 1992,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Capino </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, which has been critical of her leadership. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> loyalists are loosely organized into several political groups, including the `` I Am a Filipino Movement,'' and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. Those groups routinely muster crowds of several hundred, who turn out for pro-Marcos rallies at public squares and in front of the American embassy. The crowds are a curious mix of middle-aged men and women, aging movie queens, former Marcos-era officials and northerners studying in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Reliable figures on the number of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters are unavailable. His lawyer, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Recto </PERSON>, insists that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> still enjoys broad albeit discreet support. `` After all, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was elected and proclaimed by the people while <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> was just put in the chair by two men _ <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Recto </PERSON> told the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> BusinessWorld </ORGANIZATION>. He was referring to the role of Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, a former defense minister, and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, the former military chief, in the February 1986 uprising that toppled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. But results of congressional elections in May 1987 and of regional balloting last January show the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> with little support except in <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' native north and in scattered areas of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island. Loyalty to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remains strongest in his home province, <ORGANIZATION> Ilocos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION>, and other areas of northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> where the Ilocano language is spoken. Ilocanos make up about 10 percent of the 58 million Filipinos and have a reputation here for clannishness. `` The trouble with us <LOCATION> Ilocanos </LOCATION> is we feel prouder of the honor of having a president from among us rather than the benefits it brings,'' said <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazo </PERSON>, an Ilocano member of a pro-Aquino party, in a recent interview. Elsewhere, there are numerous signs that most Filipinos no longer believe <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has a role to play in Philippine politics. A survey of about 2,000 <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> residents, conducted in March and released Thursday by the respected <ORGANIZATION> Ateneo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, found that the percentage of those who opposed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return declined from 68 percent in October to 39 percent in March. But it appeared the decline was due more to a feeling that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was no longer a danger than to any new support for him. Even some military dissidents who have tried to topple the government seem reluctant to link themselves to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Right-wing sources say former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, leader of the Aug. 28 coup attempt, has refused to join with two other renegades _ former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON> and former Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumel </PERSON> _ because of their identification with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, who escaped from a prison ship last month, played a key role in the February 1986 military revolt that triggered the mass uprising against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Durano </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a congressman from <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> island and son of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' longtime friend and political ally <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Durano </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, said recently that despite personal ties to the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family, political reality has forced him to cooperate with the Aquino administration. `` If I do n't cooperate with the administration, my bills wo n't get passed and I ca n't work for my constituents,'' he said

<HEAD>Study Foresees Massive Change in U.S. Industry in Next Two Decades</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After a four-year study on new technologies, the government has concluded that the next two decades will be a time of massive change in which virtually every <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> product, service and job will be reshaped. The study, done by the <ORGANIZATION> congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> and released on Saturday, said that Americans in the 21st century should enjoy longer, more productive lives than any preceding generation. The study said that emerging technologies should offer the opportunity to expand educational opportunities, extend life and reduce sickness and make work more rewarding by using machines for tedious, repetitive jobs. But the study warned that rapid change also threatens to `` shake the foundations of the most secure American businesses.'' `` With each opportunity for progress, there are opportunities for serious misstep,'' the study said. `` Change can create an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in graceless decline, its living standards falling behind those of other world powers.'' The report is titled `` Technology and the American Economic Transition.'' Eight congressional committees ordered researchers to take an in-depth look at the forces now at work on society and what the implications were for policy-makers. `` We know that we are moving away from an economy heavily dependent on raw materials, where most businesses were isolated from international trade,'' said project director <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. As one example of how change has already reshaped the country, the study said that the number of lawyers, bankers, scientists and accountants needed to supply Americans with food was now roughly equal to the number of farmers. In fact, only four out of every 100 jobs in food production is on the farm. More than half of the jobs in food production now are held by sales people, precision craftsmen, managers and data entry clerks. The study said that for the country to take full advantage of emerging technologies, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should consider making fundamental changes in its tax laws and various government regulations. `` Regulations designed to protect consumers ... may have outlived their usefulness in areas ranging from banking to housing to electric utilities,'' the study said. In the tax area, the study urged reducing or abolishing the tax on capital gains and reforming or abolishing the corporate income tax. The report said these taxes reduce needed investment to boost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> productivity. The study also said that the deduction for housing interest should be limited to a fixed amount because it made little sense to encourage investment savings in the form of home purchases but not permit the complete deductibility of educational expenses because this discouraged investment in human capital. Among the report's predictions about the future: _ New technologies for collecting, storing and manipulating information have the potential to revolutionize the economy Businesses are already spending 40 percent of their investment dollar on computers and other `` information'' machines, double the 1978 share. `` The potential productivity gains in this area _ the movement and organization of information _ are at least as great as those produced -LRB- by -RRB- the first Industrial Revolution,'' the study said. _ Increased foreign competition was inevitable with the post-World War II recovery of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the emergence of sophisticated production in places like <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> Undisputed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic leadership may be lost, but the change does not necessarily mean that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> living standards will decline. Living standards in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> rose steadily for a century after it lost its dominant position in the world economy. _ Consolidation of farm ownership is likely to continue so that by the year 2000, the 14 percent of farms with annual sales higher than $ 250,000 will account for between 80 percent and 90 percent of total sales Likewise, grocery stores will continue getting larger. So-called super stores with 200,000 square feet of space offering 20,000 products now account for 28 percent of all grocery store sales. _ The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> housing industry, to combat the decline in home ownership, may follow the trends of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, moving toward prefabricated homes built on assembly lines, sold in showrooms and then put together on the site _ The nation's educational system is on the brink of major technological changes through the use of computers that will make learning more productive and fun while allowing teachers more time to spend with individual students

 Writing about your ex-boss, who also happens to be the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, can be profitable. A sampling of the crop of books on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> by former administration officials shows that some of the authors have done quite well.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has told President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> he shared objections by prosecutors to dismissing drug trafficking charges against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, one of the prosecutors says. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` told me that he also opposed'' any dismissal and `` he would convey my thoughts to the president,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said Friday after meeting with the attorney general in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` He did that today,'' <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, whose office in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> obtained one of two drug indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in February, said from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> if he were ordered to sign an order dismissing charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, `` They would n't have to fire me, I would resign.'' `` I could not myself sign an order of dismissal, but I may not be in a position to stop it,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said Friday in his first public comment about the negotitations reportedly going on to remove the military leader from power. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials have said they were `` plea bargaining'' with the Panamanian military chief and de facto ruler over the possible dropping of drug-smuggling indictments returned in February by grand juries in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> apparently believes that dismissal of the indictments is the only way to induce <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure, but the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sees that concession as too high a price to pay. But <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said dismissing the case would `` send the wrong message to the people of this country.'' `` What it says is that the bigger you are and if you have more threats to give to this country, we'll let you get away with criminality,'' <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said, explaining his objections. `` How do we continue ... going after the little fish when the big fish can walk away?'' he said, referring in particular to the Colombia-based <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. As he has since word of a possible deal with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leaked out Wednesday, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told reporters he would have no comment on the matter. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., today lauded the administration's objective of getting rid of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but said the charges against him must `` Letting him off the hook would send exactly the wrong message at exactly the wrong time to the world's drug king-pins, the peddlers of death and misery,'' said the former presidential candidate in a statement released by his office. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was asked about assertions by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> that negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on his eventual departure from power have collapsed. `` He says that all the time,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` He said ` fall apart' or something similar before. `` We are still talking. We are still negotiating.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, met with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday afternoon. He would not say what the subject of the meeting was or who else, if anyone, attended. The president left for his weekend at Camp David a half-hour later than originally scheduled, but <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> would not say whether the meeting caused the delay. Earlier Friday, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s foreign minister denied that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was negotiating to have the drug charges dropped. Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' said no deal involving <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was imminent and the drug indictment `` is n't really part of the negotiations.'' He did not elaborate on what was being discussed. A top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, has been engaged in secret negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and administration sources said Wednesday the military chieftain was told that if he left <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for a year, perhaps in August, the indictments would be dropped. However, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said Friday night, `` I have not talked with Mr. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>,'' and he called for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to leave the country. `` The dignity of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is not negotiable while there are foreign troops on our territory, humiliating our soil, while there is economic aggression, as long as there are threats, as long as there is psychological war ... as long as Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> does not get out,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said during a meeting in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>, 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said she had no comment on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s statements or whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was considering withdrawing <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has survived widespread public protests and an economic collapse at home as well as sustained <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic and economic pressure.

<HEAD>Rangoon Says Two Killed By Police, 625 Arrested In Student Riots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two students killed during riots in March were shot to death by police, according to the findings of an official inquiry announced Saturday. A government statement on the front pages of newspapers said a three-member government-appointed commission reported that 34 people, including students, policemen and people living in the area of the campuses, were injured in the March 12-17 violence. The commission was headed by <PERSON> U </PERSON> <PERSON> Ba </PERSON> <PERSON> Maw </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justices </ORGANIZATION>, or the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The statement did n't say when the commission reported its findings to the government. The riots at the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> were the worst student disturbances in recent years in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, a tightly controlled nation under one-party rule. The commission said 625 students were arrested. Authorities had n't previously given any figure for arrests and said only that one student died from unspecified causes when police quelled rioting at the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> insitute on March 13. `` The post-mortem revealed that the two students died of bullets from 12-bore guns used by the police to disperse the crowd,'' Saturday's announcement said. `` To minimize casualties, police used 12-bore single barrel guns instead of the M-16 rifles with which they were armed.'' The announcement said that of the students arrested, 484 have been released and the others held for further investigation. It said the violence began March 12 when students at the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and local youths fought over which music cassette they wanted played at a tea shop near the school. Authorities arrested a local youth said to have been involved in the melee but released him for lack of evidence, the announcement said. More clashes with local youths ensued the next day as students angered by the release hurled stones and set fire to several buildings. It said riot police separated the 300 students and 300 local inhabitants, but the students, who had retreated inside the campus, began throwing stones at the police. The police retaliated with water cannons, but the stone-throwing intensified. The police then fired 14 tear gas bombs and six shots from 12-bore guns, the announcement said. It said five students were struck by gunshots. One student, <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Phone </PERSON> <PERSON> Maw </PERSON>, a 23-year-old engineering student, died on the spot while another student, <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Soe </PERSON> <PERSON> Naing </PERSON>, died in the hospital on April 5. The disturbances at the institute continued until March 15 when security personnel took control of the campus and arrested 68 students, it said. It said that over the next two days, students at <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, `` instigated by political elements from the outside,'' joined the unrest. The announcement made no mention of March 18 rioting in downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in which hundreds of students and others, demonstrating in support of the students at the universities, shouted anti-government slogans, smashed cars and set ablaze a government department store. That riot was quelled by security forces. There has been no official mention of arrests or casualties.

<HEAD>Rebels May Face Disintegration, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Nicaraguan Contras, poorly supplied and politically divided, may face disintegration, with impact beyond <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s borders, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. Less than two months after the rebels signed a temporary cease-fire agreement with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government, administration analysts on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> say the Contras' future seems bleak for a variety of reasons: _ Up to 3,000 rebels, denied delivery of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid shipments, have fled across the Nicaraguan border into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in search of food _ Serious rifts have emerged in the Contra ranks An undetermined number of rebels mutinied recently against military commander <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> at a Contra camp in southern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> also faces opposition from at least two members of the rebel political directorate. _ If fighting resumes after the current cease fire ends on June 1, the Contras have enough military supplies to last only one to two months <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s military aid request on Feb. 3 and there is little support at present for a reversal of that decision. _ Soviet military supplies are continuing to flow to the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> at a rate slightly ahead of the 1987 pace According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates, Soviet military deliveries totaled $ 105 million for the first three months of 1988. `` The Contras seem to be in the process of disintegrating,'' said one official, insisting on anonymity. `` The consolidation of Sandinista rule is upon us.'' The official said all of the predictions he and some others in the administration had made in February after the congressional rejection of Contra aid are being borne out. Specifically, he said the aid vote has contributed to increasing right-left political polarization in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, reflected in a failed military coup attempt there last week, and in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, where the rightist ARENA party won impressively in national elections in March, the official said. He added that the prospective demise of the U.S.-backed rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has had the effect of `` emboldening'' leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> who are aligned with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. These views, however, are not universally shared in the administration. Another official, also speaking privately, said the trends in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> are the result of internal developments unrelated to the situation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The prevailing view among more conservative members of the administration is that consolidation of <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> rule would generate nervousness in neighboring countries, forcing them to shift priorities from democratic development to concerns over internal security. If military coups occur, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would retaliate by drastically reducing assistance, creating both economic hardship and increasing sympathy for leftist rebels, according to this scenario. The Contras and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> signed a temporary truce in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, on March 23. They agreed to try to negotiate a permanent cease-fire during a 60-day period starting April 1. With the deadline for reaching agreement on formally ending their six-year war just two weeks away, there has been virtually no progress toward that objective. Disputes between the Sandinistas and the Contras have prevented delivery of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid to the rebels inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, leaving the administration with no option but to try to send them cash via couriers. If no final agreement is reached by the June 1 deadline, the Contras have two obvious alternatives available to them, neither very promising, the officials said. As one official described it, the Contras could resume the war and face defeat against superior Sandinista firepower. Or they could reach agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> on a truce extension, enabling the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to maintain slow-pace negotiations in hopes that total demoralization of the rebels eventually would set in. If the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> decide to resume the war, this would win renewed sympathy for the rebels in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but the Contras also could be confronted with what one official said was the possibility of a quick `` knockout blow.'' In that case, he said, `` if the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decides to approve more aid, there would be no one to give the aid to.''

<HEAD>South Looms As Tough Battleground For Democratic Nominee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The South, once solidly Democratic in presidential races but now reliably Republican, is a tough battleground for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as he tries to put together an electoral coalition to defeat <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and enable the party to recapture the White House. With many states in the politically conservative region viewed as beyond his reach in November, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is being urged to choose a running mate who could help the Democrats carry <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the two largest states south of the Mason-Dixon line. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primaries in both those states on Super Tuesday, a fact that gives Democrats reason for optimism. Supporters of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also are quick to argue that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not have the hold on Southern voters that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could claim. It's possible for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to find the 270-vote <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> majority outside the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, a coalition that would require every big industrial state in the North plus <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and Farm Belt states where economic hard times the past seven years have made the Reagan-Bush administration politically unpopular. But any <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> strategy without the South would require an electoral shift of historic proportions for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory in November. `` They can not let us sweep it -LRB- the South -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON>, a Republican consultant and authority on electoral college strategies. `` If we take <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and the rest of the cotton <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, I do n't think they can win.'' `` What I ca n't figure out is how you get the numbers if you do n't run strong in the South,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, the 1984 Democratic presidential nominee. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, who served President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political director, predicted that the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would `` decide the South is a mirage and that their best hope lies in a sweep of the industrial belt.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, said that if the political trends go in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' direction and he is headed for a big victory he would run well in the South, but `` if it's a close election, I'd say he has very little hope of carrying much outside of perhaps a couple of border states. For generations, 16 Southern and border states gave Democratic presidential candidates a solid electoral base. In 1944, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> took all 167 electoral votes from those states. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> broke the Democratic hold on the region in 1952 and 1956. And in 1964, when Democrat <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> crushed Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, the only bright spot for the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> was the Deep South. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> resisted the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> landslide and backed <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, the only states outside of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to support him. Since then, Southern and border states have voted strongly Republican except in 1976, when <PERSON> Georgian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was the Democratic candidate. In 1980, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took 138 of the region's 169 electoral votes and four years later, the Republican president received all but the 3 electoral votes of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Democratic pollster <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is based in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and she pointed out that in 1984, <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> got 13 percent of the white vote in the state. `` If the white vote tripled and the black vote came out the way it was supposed to, then <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by half a percentage point,'' she said. `` Think about that as a mission. We've got to triple what we did in'84.'' When <PERSON> Claibourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, an Atlanta-based pollster, was asked how <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was playing in the South, he replied, `` He does n't play so hot. He is your classical, party activist, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for president of which we've seen many come and all go.'' There was little agreement on whether <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> would offer the best hope for a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> breakthrough. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> makes his home, where he first became active in politics and where he was elected to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat. A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, who insisted on anonymity, called it `` highly unlikely'' that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could carry the state, `` as unlikely that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would carry <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> in'84.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Quackenbush </PERSON>, who was southern coordinator for the <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> campaign, said he thought <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a better chance of carrying <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> than of winning <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is just a hard state for a Democrat to take,'' he said. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democrats talked optimistically about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' prospects against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in their state. `` The decision on the vice presidency will be fundamental,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Stetson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> activist. If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chooses Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> or Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, `` The ticket will be very saleable in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettigrew </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> or Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> or Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> would be the strongest running mates for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because they would `` assure people'' on foreign and defense policy. <PERSON> Pettigrew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quackenbush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> would be a lot more effective in the South than <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> took the opposite view. He said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> might not get <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> any state other than <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. While the senator could add a couple of points to the ticket in other Southern states, it might not be enough to carry any of them. `` <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> would make much more sense,'' he said, because the senator could bring home <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for the Democrats. Even a partisan like <PERSON> Quackenbush </PERSON> conceded that in the South `` if you're from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, whether it's reality or perception, you're perceived as a liberal.'' But he contended that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can win support in the South by emphasizing the idea that as a governor he has been `` a fiscal conservative.'' A big plus for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the South is the perception that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not have the hold on voters that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hold on Southern voters is not intense,'' said <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>. `` Nobody gets excited about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Fiji's Marks First Anniversary Of Coup, Police Detain 18 People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police on Saturday detained 18 people demonstrating against the government of <PERSON> Sitiveni </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> marked the first anniversary of a military takeover that catapulted <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> celebrated his first year in power by attending an army parade where he exhorted soldiers to be considerate in preserving order this weekend. Troops remained on full alert as a precaution against possible violence, but no major trouble was reported. Police broke up a `` demonstration for democracy'' in downtown <LOCATION> Suva </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> attended the parade at the Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Barracks </PERSON> army headquarters. He told his troops to be mindful that some sections of the community had suffered as a result of the coup. The celebrations should not `` make things worse for people who might fear for their safety and their property,'' said <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>, in an apparent reference to Indians, who outnumber ethnic Fijians in the 715,000 population. On May 14, 1987, <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>, then a lieutenant colonel and third in the army's chain of command, led 10 masked soldiers into <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and arrested the elected Indian-majority coalition government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Timoci </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> said he staged the coup to protect the interests of ethnic Fijians, who comprise 47 percent of the population. <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON> had been in office only a month after defeating Prime Minister Ratu Sir <PERSON> Kamisese </PERSON> <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> in April elections. After the coup, an interim government was set up, but when it did n't please <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>, he staged a second takeover on Sept. 25. Since then a nervous calm has settled over <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>. The country's tourist-based economy is in shambles Gross domestic product is down 11 percent, sugar production _ the country's major cash crop _ is down 20.3 percent, tourism has plummeted 26.9 percent and the <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> dollar has been devalued by 33 percent. At his home in <LOCATION> Viseisei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON> issued a statement vowing to continue to push for racial equality in <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, a group of 300 islands east of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. At the parade, <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> presented good conduct and meritorious service medals to six high-ranking army officers, several of whom were involved in the May 14, 1987 takeover. He told supporters that the recipients of the medals were `` shining examples'' to follow. Among the demonstrators were members of the <ORGANIZATION> Fiji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest. The women, wearing black as a sign of mourning, carried placards denouncing the coup. Banners reading `` Only One Race _ The Human Race'' and `` Democracy Lives'' were torn down by police, who told the crowd to leave before it got out of control. When they refused to move, police herded some people into vans and took them away. Officials said the demonstrators were not charged and would be released later. Other demonstrators went to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andrew </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Presbysterian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> where, watched from outside by police and soldiers, they held a religious service. On Saturday, the gates at the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building remained locked. <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> has had no Parliament since the coup and is now governed by an interim administration led by <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> while a new constitution is being written to guarantee power for ethnic Fijians. No other incidents were reported and the army was not much in evidence around the country except for guards at key points, such as power installations.

 The city's fire chief says he will seek a criminal investigation into an alleged delay by security guards in reporting a fire that ravaged the state's tallest skyscraper. Fire Chief <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said Friday he intends to pursue legal action `` to the extent possible'' in the wake of the May 4 inferno that devastated four floors of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> tower and left one man dead. Security personnel allegedly `` failed to notify the Fire Department of the fire in a timely manner, which is a violation of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Municipal Code,'' said Battalion Chief Dean <PERSON> Cathey </PERSON>. City officials said security guards reset fire alarms that went off on the 12th floor because they believed them to be false. They say guards delayed notifying authorities for seven minutes, allowing the blaze to spread through the 12th floor of the 62-floor office building. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Clauson </PERSON>, an official with <ORGANIZATION> Pedus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has disputed fire officials' version of events. <PERSON> Clauson </PERSON> said Pedus guards called the fire department about a minute after the alarms went off. Fire officials said that when fire alarms sounded a third time on the 12th floor, security officers sent a building engineer to the 12th floor to investigate. The worker, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Handy </PERSON>, 24, died in the blaze. Manning spoke Friday during state senate hearings currently being conducted in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on proposed fire-sprinkler legislation. A bill would require the installation of fire sprinklers in all high-rise buildings in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clauson </PERSON> did not return telephone seeking comment about the investigation ordered by <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Bennett Holds Out Prospect of Future Run for Presidency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Outgoing Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> says that if he runs for any political office in the future, it will be the presidency. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that such an effort may be years away, `` but after watching some of the people in the stakes for the presidency, I could do that well.'' `` I wo n't mention anybody in particular,'' the outspoken educator said, but he added that he was referring to both Republican and Democratic hopefuls. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who announced last Monday he is quitting the Cabinet in mid-September to write and lecture, brought up the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> himself when asked in an interview if he aspired to run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he has had overtures about possible <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races from his native state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, his adopted state of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, where he now lives. But he said neither the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, nor the possibility of a college presidency, holds any interest for him. `` Right now, if I were going to run for anything in the future, I'd want to run for president,'' he volunteered. Asked about the vice presidency, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` I'm not sure I'd make a very good No. 2 man. I like to run things.'' Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has already locked up the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, says he wants to be `` the education president.'' His campaign has kept its distance from the controversial <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who has warred with teacher unions and pilloried college presidents. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> did not mention <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by name, but said, `` We'll probably have a good <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president in'88 who'll be there for a couple of terms. If I do this, this could be way in the future.'' A lifelong Democrat, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> switched to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> in May 1986, 15 months after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> put him in the Cabinet. He has proven a big draw at Republican functions across the country. Asked if he was now wedded to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, the 44-year-old <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> replied, `` Probably.'' Only probably? `` Well, sure. Look, I was a Democrat. I shifted to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because the Democrats left the ranch and deserted their principles. I do n't see that happening in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But I put country above party, always have,'' he said. `` This will no doubt shock by sheer chutzpah some of my critics, but we were not political. We were principled and a lot of our principles ... went to the heart of what <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stands for and what a lot of liberal Democrats stand against,'' he said. `` I know that I'm popular with audiences out there in the country, and it does n't seem to make much difference whether they're Democrats or Republicans,'' he said. He said his relations with the education establishment may be at their worst, but `` I would bet my relations with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are at an all-time high.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> expressed no regrets about his penchant for controversies. He said he `` probably drove some people crazy'' by speaking out at Cabinet meetings on issues other than education. He said he decided from the start that `` I may never have a job like this again, so I'm going to do it all the way.'' Sometimes, `` people rolled their eyes and said, ` There he goes again,''' he related. `` I talked about drugs a lot, use of the military, and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ginsburg </ORGANIZATION>, AIDS and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but I decided I was n't going to leave this job and say, ` Darn it! I should have said this! Boy if I had it to do all over again!''' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> took it upon himself to call <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> last Nov. 6 to urge him to withdraw as a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee after <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>'s admission that he smoked marijuana while a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> law professor. <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> withdrew his name from consideration the next day. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he has not considered making such a call to his mentor, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the embattled attorney general. `` No I have not. It's an entirely different situation. ... What you have in the case of Ed -LRB- is -RRB- lots of allegations, no evidence,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. Asked if he were comfortable with an attorney general under constant investigation, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> replied: `` It would be nicer, it would be better if business were smoother. But no one feels more uncomfortable than Ed about getting all this. But that's not a situation I'm going to enter into.'' Asked about the setbacks <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has suffered of late, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said there have been `` a lot of fly bites, people nipping at him.'' But `` with time, the little things will slip away and the large impact will be clear. ... `` he said. `` This is a very great man and a good and important presidency.''

 Famed Kenyan flyer <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> possessed the grace of the African animals she grew up with, and, her admirers admit, at times was as cunning and ruthless. `` <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>: A Shadow on the Sun,'' CBS' four-hour miniseries starring <PERSON> Stefanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> as the famed aviator and author of `` West With the Night,'' a stirring account of life in colonial <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, airs Sunday and Tuesday. `` She was as much the <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as she was a well-liked African Queen of the bushland,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON>, author of `` Straight On Till Morning,'' the 1987 biography of <LOCATION> Markham </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, tall, slender, self-possessed, fascinated people drawn to her fearless, Garboesque nature throughout her life. Her solo flight across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in 1936 _ the first from east to west _ made her an international heroine. The miniseries, which is actually based on a Vanity Fair article by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, traces <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>'s life from childhood in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where she hunted wild pig with <PERSON> Nandi </PERSON> tribesmen. She became the continent's first female <PERSON> bush </PERSON> pilot and a renowned thoroughbred horse trainer. According to her biographer, <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> angered and even frightened people with an imperious and pedantic nature. `` People either utterly loved or loathed her,'' said <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON>, in a recent interview from her home in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. As if to make that point, the movie details <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>'s often disastrous personal life, including three failed marriages and love affairs with flyer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> and <PERSON> Denys </PERSON> <PERSON> Finch-Hatton </PERSON>, the English elephant hunter played by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> in `` Out of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' In her critically acclaimed memoirs, `` West With the Night,'' first published in 1942, <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> was praised as having a `` poet's feeling for her land. But preoccupied with the advent of World War II, the American public virtually ignored the book. Following its rediscovery by <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, restaurateur <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutekunst </PERSON>, the book was republished in 1983. By May 7 it had sold 500,000 copies; it was listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> best-seller list for 79 weeks. In some areas, fascination with <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> approaches cult status, according to <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> publicist for CBS. `` I ca n't believe that this was a woman who did what she did more than 50 years ago,'' said <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> in the 1920s and 1930s was a haven for titled Europeans, and <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> lived among the upper class, which earned the nickname `` The Happy Valley Set'' in British newspapers because of their relatively loose morals. Those who knew <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> described her as possessing an enchanting beauty. Critic <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> writes that `` to the common imagination she was a sort of Circe,'' referring to the Greek mythological enchantress who turned men into beasts. <PERSON> Gutekunst </PERSON> said he was taken aback when he met <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> for the first time. Ever the flirt, she took to calling him `` Georgie-Porgie,'' borrowing from the nursery rhyme in which the boy `` kissed the girls and made them cry.'' `` I called her the <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, not just because she really was beautiful at her age, even when I first met her at 82, but because of her carriage, her long swan-like neck, the mystery, the confidence,'' said <PERSON> Gutekunst </PERSON>. <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> soared west across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in 1936, becoming the first person to fly solo from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where she crash-landed in a bog in <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>. She then fell into obscurity. But not before tumultuous years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where she worked as a consultant for <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producers, married a heavy drinker, published her biography and worked intermittently as a short-story writer. <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Melton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mowbray </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leicestershire </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and was brought to a farm in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> by her divorced father, retired <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clutterbuck </PERSON>. She had less than four years of formal education, but said her father made her read widely. Later she was given a crash course in literature and music by <PERSON> Finch-Hatton </PERSON>, the Oxford-educated aristocrat and lover of Danish <PERSON> Baroness </PERSON> <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Blixen </PERSON>, who wrote as <PERSON> Isak </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinesen </PERSON>. By 1936, several planes had crossed the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> westward from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but all had at least two people aboard. <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, in a single-engine <LOCATION> Percival </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gull </LOCATION> monoplane, departed <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Abingdon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> aerodrome on Sept. 4. Despite crash-landing because of low fuel, she was given a ticker-tape parade in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, her original goal. <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> in 1986 at the age of 83.

<HEAD>Mysterious Coincidence Between Quakes and Air Pressure Pattern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Abnormal atmospheric pressure patterns over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the summer and fall may trigger earthquakes in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, including deadly jolts in July 1986 and last October, a scientist says. `` I've found tantalizing but not completely conclusive evidence of a relationship between sea-level pressure patterns and their associated winds and moderate and larger earthquakes,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Namias </PERSON>. <PERSON> Namias </PERSON> spent 30 years as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s extended forecast division in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and is now affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION> His work in long-range weather forecasting is widely respected. The statistical correlation between earthquakes and air pressure is weak, difficult to explain in scientifically respectable terms and `` definitely a far-out idea,'' said <PERSON> Namias </PERSON> in a recent telephone interview. But he speculated that if atmospheric pressure patterns are related to quakes, it may be because winds associated with the patterns raise offshore sea levels slightly, putting more pressure on the earth. `` We know so little about why earthquakes occur when they do that we've got to keep an open mind, even on what seems like a far-out kind of idea,'' said geologist <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said that while he guesses the correlation will turn out to be coincidental, `` it's too early to rule out these kinds of things. And <PERSON> Namias </PERSON> is certainly a very respected scientist.'' Forces from unsual air pressure patterns and higher sea levels are smaller than the moon's tidal influence on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and its oceans, and seismologists still debate whether lunar gravity triggers quakes, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON>, scientist in charge of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey's <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> office. `` If we ca n't prove that tides do it, it seems a longshot that -LRB- any pattern of -RRB- atmospheric pressure does it,'' <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Namias </PERSON> said he studied <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION>'s list of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quakes measuring 4.5 or more in the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale since 1947. He found the quakes tended to occur more often a month to six weeks after the onset of an abnormally strong gradient between very high, sea-level atmospheric pressure over the eastern half of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and very low, surface-level pressure over the interior portion of the western third of the nation. The unusual pattern existed prior to the 5.9-magnitude <ORGANIZATION> Whittier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narrows </ORGANIZATION> quake and its aftershocks, which rocked <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> last October, killing eight people, injuring more than 200 and causing $ 358 million in damage, <PERSON> Namias </PERSON> said. He said the same pattern preceded three hefty jolts in July 1986: the 5.9-magnitude July 8 <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> quake, which caused $ 5.3 million in damage; the 5.3-magnitude July 13 <ORGANIZATION> Oceanside </ORGANIZATION> quake, which killed one person, injured 28 others and caused $ 720,000 in damage, and the 6-magnitude July 21 <LOCATION> Chalfant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> quake near Bishop, which caused $ 436,500 in damage. The abnormal pattern involved barometer readings of roughly 30.1 inches of mercury offshore and roughly 29.75 over the interior, <PERSON> Namias </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Namias </PERSON> said the unusual large-scale pattern is unrelated to local weather or to what some people contend is `` earthquake weather,'' unseasonably hot, dry, windy conditions such as those last October. <PERSON> Namias </PERSON> said he first noticed the quake-air pressure pattern correlation years ago, but even after the 1986 quakes he decided `` I'd keep my mouth shut on the topic'' because he knew seismologists would be dubious. He changed his mind after last October's shocks, writing a paper published last month in the journal <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letters </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Namias </PERSON> said he noted the quake-air pressure correlation only during summer and fall months, and that winter and spring circulation patterns apparently discourage the phenomenon. In addition to speculating that winds related to the pressure pattern might raise sea levels, <PERSON> Namias </PERSON> said large-scale winds might affect the ground directly. He said <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s rotation, and thus the length of a day, changes slightly over decades because of wind drag on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s surface. Other scientists have suggested a link between volcanic activity in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and atmospheric pressure, wind and sea levels, <PERSON> Namias </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Pentagon View: Drug War and Real War Not The Same</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The decision by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to order the military into the war on drugs came despite warnings from <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> leaders that soldiers are n't trained for civilian law enforcement and fears it may blur the line between military and civilian authority. `` Our people are not trained to read Miranda rights. They are trained to shoot to kill,'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week. Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said, `` The military is uncomfortable with this, that's true, and I think there are very tricky questions here, but they have to realize that the American public wants them to help.'' `` There's a war going on against our people, a war of drugs, and we need the military's help in fighting that war,'' said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. Two weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 385-23 to order President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to have the military seal off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders against drug trafficking. Last Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 83-6 to order an expanded military role, including arrest powers for <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers aboard warships that stop drug boats in international waters. Both votes approved amendments to the separate <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bills passed by each chamber. The bills now go to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference to reconcile differences, including the military-drug provisions. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials have outlined two major fears about expanding the military's role in the drug fight. One is practical and the other legal. The practical objection is that having the military fight drugs takes away from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s main task of defending the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against military threats. The legal objection arises from the nation's traditional separation between military and civilian authority. That separation is most clearly spelled out by the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law which bans the military from enforcing civilian laws. `` The military are not trained for the law enforcement mission,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said last week. `` To suddenly tell them you're in law enforcement, you have to shift the entire focus, the training There's a major difference between military and police work.'' Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> noted that devoting military resources to drug enforcement means those resources will have to be taken from somewhere else and `` that can affect the readiness of this country to defend itself.'' The two fears are legitimate, noted <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and other supporters of an expanded military role. `` I do n't think we're really blurring the line too much,'' he said. `` Any arrests the military would make would be on the high seas, in international waters, where a member of the military has the same arrest power that any citizen does.'' As for the effect on the military's readiness to fight, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> noted, `` I believe that's something that we're going to have to closely watch, and if there is an effect on readiness, then we'll have to deal with that But they have to be ready to help this country fight a war that's already going on, a war against drugs.'' Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I think it's very troubling to be using the military this way, and one must be very careful because you run into all sorts of potential legal problems about the separation of the civilian and the military. `` There are also potential problems with readiness,'' said <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>. `` The military is trained for specific roles and missions and to the extent you take them from those missions, you detract from readiness.'' But `` there is tremendous pressure to act,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> noted. `` People want something done and the pressure is growing.'' Sens. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., said they understood the military's objections, particularly on legal But both are from states with long international borders and severe trafficking problems, and they said those facts override the fears. `` We have to stop the drugs before they get into the country,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` We need to stop them on the seas or in the air. Local law enforcement is being overwhelmed by a flood of drugs. Once it gets into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it is immeasurably more difficult to control.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said, `` this nation faces a terribly, terribly serious drug problem. I think that there is a narrow, specific role for arrests by the military in international waters. They have the resources to do this.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said, `` We spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year on the military so we can be safe. But this nation is already at war, a war we're losing. And we need our best troops in that war.'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, speaking of Pentagon complaints that drug fighting will hurt military readiness, said, `` This is a national security issue. Our military is supposed to help protect our national security. Drugs as bad an enemy as any other enemy we would face.'' The loudest critic was Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> pilot, who chastised his colleagues Friday for speaking `` rhetoric for press release purposes.'' `` We all get up, posture, make our little statements, and it is n't going to make any difference'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>. He said the nation lacks an effective, coordinated anti-drug plan. `` This is not the mission for the military,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Week Promising Roses for Republican Candidate Bush Turns Thorny</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It was a week that should have come up all roses for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with endorsements arriving from both the president and his only remaining Republican rival. But instead, thorns littered the way. In recent days, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his lieutenants have been forced to take the defensive on a host of issues, ranging from alleged drug trafficking by <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to a lackluster endorsement from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Some of the troubles were minor irritants; others loomed as potential major problems as the vice president sought to translate his lock on the Republican presidential nomination into a fall general election strategy. Some of the recent problems besetting the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign: _ He unintentionally handed <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a new issue with his characterization of the Democrat as `` the hustler from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'' in a speech to a GOP audience in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> seized upon the remark, saying it was offensive and showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` started to panic.'' _ Despite enjoying a mathematical lock on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination since the April 26 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won only 71 percent of the vote in last Tuesday's <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> primary Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., who had withdrawn from the race but whose name appeared on the ballot, captured 24 percent while <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> _ who endorsed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the following day to effectively end his own candidacy _ polled 5 percent _ Questions intensified about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s prior knowledge of alleged drug trafficking by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, fueled by news accounts suggesting that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might have known more about the situation than he has professed The political problems for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> grew even larger with mid-week reports suggesting the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was considering dropping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug charges against the Panamanian general in exchange for his leaving power. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who stresses a resume laden with foreign policy experience and vows a strong anti-drug effort, again found himself in the position of having to plead ignorance on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. _ Fallout from the legal difficulties surrounding Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> continued to swirl about the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, heightened by on-the-record assertions by two top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advisers that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had become a campaign liability <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the statements unauthorized. Analysts said the <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> affair could hurt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with voters. _ And finally, after weeks of jockeying between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides and the White House over the timing of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s formal endorsment of his vice president, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> finally delivered _ but with a terse statement that neither praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor touched on why Americans should vote for him Furthermore, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mispronounced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s name at one point, calling him, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosh </PERSON>.'' By week's end, the president's mystifyingly brief endorsement appeared to be the least of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's worries. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared he `` could n't be more pleased'' with the chief executive's manner of support and presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was `` mortified'' to think that his words had been received as anything less than enthusiastic The campaign showed greater concern over the results of the <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> primary, which showed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could not win solid GOP support in the state even while running virtually unopposed. Political analysts suggested the weak showing underscores a problem <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is likely to have in November throughout the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where the farm economy, despite some recent signs of improvement, is still troubled. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s track record in the region has not been good. Although he later went on to win commanding victories in other states, he came in a disappointing third in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses last February. He also lost to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s primary, garnering only 19 percent to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s 55 percent. And, in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't even bother to mount a major effort A straw poll there in February showed only 11 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, compared to 43 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and 28 percent for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign strategists argued that the vice president's poor showings in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> reflect Kansan <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s popularity more than their candidate's vulnerability. `` <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is still very popular -LRB- in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> -RRB-, and there was a very low turnout,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> deputy campaign manager <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. `` And we'll take 71 percent of the vote any day of the week.'' Equally troubling to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s general-election prospects, according to analysts, was new survey evidence suggesting that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s popularity across party lines was unlikley to be transferred to his vice president. `` No president's popularity is,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` What's important is we're going to have the president as a great resource The president packs a lot of wallop out on the stump and everybody knows it.'' But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, a former consultant to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, said `` there are problems for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he's going to have to deal with'' and a lack of ready-made support among blue-collar Democrats is one of them. `` It's a problem he's going to to have to address through scheduling, speeches and through issues,'' <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said. To date, said the consultant, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has had a problem in articulating a message. He's been slow to do it. But people want a horse race and there are more Democrats than Republicans in the country. So it is nautral that the race is going to start out at least close, or maybe with -LRB- Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ahead.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in a surprise move, has settled a lawsuit brought by two environmental groups by agreeing to sharply curtail research into a high-power electrical phenomenon known as electromagnetic pulse. The settlement, approved by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> late Friday, derails at least temporarily a program the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had previously described as crucial to national security. Among other purposes, the research involved ways to `` harden'' crucial commnications and weapons guidance equipment against electrical surges triggered by nuclear explosions. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> must now determine whether its experiments, involving simulations powered by non-nuclear means, pose a danger to humans or wildlife. <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trends </ORGANIZATION>, one of the environmental groups which filed the lawsuit, hailed the agreement as `` the first court victory of this magnitude recognizing the threat posed by electronic or electrical pollution.'' `` We're extremely pleased,'' <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> added. `` This is the first recognition by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and really the first on a national level at all, of a whole new environmental hazard facing all of us.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> declined to discuss the matter or its reasons for settling the case. The suit, filed in March 1987 by the Washington-based foundation and the <ORGANIZATION> Potomac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, `` sought essentially exactly what we got _ an end to high-power testing until an assessment is performed of the threat to the environment and human and animal health,'' <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said. The settlement will shut down or sharply curtail the operations of a handful of <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> generators and, potentially, one <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> facility. Electromagnetic pulse, or <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION>, is a powerful wave, or surge, of electrical energy that is released by a nuclear explosion and which can travel long distances through the atmosphere or water. <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> became a matter of concern to the military in the early 1960s when the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> discovered a nuclear bomb detonated at high altitudes could generate a pulse so strong it could disable the electronic components used in computers, communications and guidance equipment. As a result of that discovery, military laboratories have studied the phenomenon for 25 years in the course of developing methods for enabling electronic weapons components to withstand <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION>. In recent years, <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> work also has been performed with an eye toward harnessing the energy pulses for offensive weapons, or `` zap guns.'' Under the terms of the settlement, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> must now shut down <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> generators located at <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Redstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and White Sands Missile Range, N.M. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will be required to shut down its so-called Empress 1 generator at the <ORGANIZATION> Patuxent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, Md.; to refrain from starting construction of an Empress 2 system, and to significantly reduce the operating power of two other Patuxent generators. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, meantime, will be allowed to continue operating <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> simulators at <ORGANIZATION> Kirtland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, but only if it can provide documentation within 14 days demonstrating there is no discernible environmental risk from that operation. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, public affairs director for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weapons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Kirtland </LOCATION>, said `` We would be prepared'' to furnish the documentation. One of the five <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> simulators at <LOCATION> Kirtland </LOCATION> is one dubbed Trestle, a $ 58 million structure which enables scientists to imitate <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> effects upon aircraft electrical equipment. The other <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> facilities, which are located in closer proximity to populated areas, must remain shut down or operating only at low power levels until an environmental assessment of their operation is conducted, <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said. The assessment probably will take five to six months, at which point all the generators may be returned to service but only at reduced power levels that ensure no electrical surge moves beyond the boundaries of the bases. The Pentagon must then satisfactorily complete a full-fledged environmental impact study _ a process that could take two years _ before the <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> generators can be used at their current power levels, <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said. While the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> declined comment, <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said he thought the government agreed to settle the case because the foundation's attorneys learned that two Army employees had warned the service against conducting <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> experiments at <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION> until an environmental assessment was completed When the foundation filed a motion to question the two workers, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers suddenly indicated a willingness to negotiate, <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> continued. `` They did n't want these guys to talk about the hazards,'' he said. `` We had them over a barrel.'' The foundation's lawsuit asserted that <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> experiments `` can affect human health directly, and through the disruption of electronic circuits in nuclear power plants, automobiles, computers, airplanes, phone lines and navigational systems, can cause potential catastrophies under many possible circumstances.''

<TEXT>
 The National Gallery of Art is mounting the first big show in 20 years of works by <PERSON> Fitz </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, known for his paintings of the first winner of the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cup and of the first Cunard Line ship to cross the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. `` No other painter of the 19th century matched him in capturing the character of maritime <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, in portraying the reflective sheen of calm water or the agitated surface of windblown waves, the clarity of light-filled still air or the moist atmosphere of cloudy humid days,'' gallery director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says in a tribute appearing in the catalogue of the exhibit. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilmerding </PERSON>, the museum's deputy director and a specialist on <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, classes him just below the painter <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON> <PERSON> Homer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> painted the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cup race at least twice _ once in an unusual work that contains three views of the same yacht. That one is in the <LOCATION> Peabody </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The other painting, lent to this show, shows the finale of the first race in 1851, with Britons waving their hats from a smaller boat while the Americans look the other way. A British side-wheeler packed with spectators is nearby. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> painted the Britannia, the first <ORGANIZATION> Cunard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> ship, entering <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> harbor in 1848, eight years after its first transatlantic voyage. Nearly all the 61 paintings in the show are of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> scenes. All are related to ships and the sea. There is a kind of glowing silence about them that critics say typifies the American movement now called `` luminism.'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> died in 1865, long before the term was invented. The exhibit opens Sunday in the gallery's West Building and will be there until Sept. 5. It then will move to the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> from Oct. 5 to Dec. 31. The exhibit has been financed by a grant from the <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>CAMP DAVID, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address, as delivered Saturday from his official retreat at Camp David: Yesterday, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decided to send me a trade bill that threatens to destroy jobs and would begin to reverse the policies of the last seven years After three years of hard work by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the executive, it is unfortunate that I have no choice but to send this back to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. While there are many positive aspects of this legislation, some of its provisions would move us a step further toward protectionism. Others would create new bureaucracies. But my main objection to the trade bill involves the mandatory requirements it sets down for business to give advance notice of lay-offs or plant closings. Now let me state very clearly that I believe businesses should give workers and communities just as much warning as they can when it looks as though lay-offs or plant closings are going to become unavoidable. Advance notice gives the community and the workers themselves some time to begin adjusting. It's the humane thing to do. But when big government gets in the middle of something like this, dictating all its rules and regulations, well, the humane way has a way of becoming inhumane, and what's intended to help everyday working men and women can actually end up hurting them. When you study the plant-closing provisions of the trade bill, you see that there are circumstances in which they would actually force a business to shut down. Once a struggling business issued a notice that it is likely to close or substantially reduce its workforce, then creditors, suppliers and customers would disappear, eliminating any chance of survival the business might have had. Under these conditions, temporary lay-offs are sometimes necessary to manage costs and production. And while the bill does contain a so-called `` struggling company exemption,'' this exemption is too vague and unclear to be workable. Then too, businesses will be very reluctant to add workers when it would put them over the arbitrary thresholds in this bill and subject them to yet another regime of federal regulation. Make no mistake, these concerns are very real. One independent study showed that if these provisions had been in effect between 1982 and 1986, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today would have almost half a million fewer jobs. Yes, as I've said, our country should support advance notification of lay-offs and plant closings, but this should be decided by bargaining between labor and management _ not by some arbitrary rules laid down by politicians and enforced by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureaucrats. And if I feel especially strong about this, I guess it's because I was a union president for years myself. There were times when the union, The Screen Actors Guild, took a hard line in negotiating with management. But yes, there were also times when the motion picture industry was having its ups and downs, times when the union decided not to press quite so hard because we wanted to make sure the whole industry remained healthy and profitable. The point is, it was up to us, the unions and management, to run the motion picture industry together. We did n't need <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in on this act. I guess what it all really comes down to is this: just what kind of a government do we want? For these past seven years the administration has limited government, cutting taxes and regulations alike. The result, the longest peacetime expansion in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> history; unemployment at the lowest level in almost 14 years; the creation of 16 million new jobs and, I might add, in the last three years, four times as many businesses have opened as have closed. We could go back to big government and indeed many of those in favor of these plant-closing provisions argue that they're already in effect in many European countries. Well to tell you the truth, I'm sort of proud of being an American, proud that since 1983 the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has created six times as many jobs as has Western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. I do n't want to leave the impression that the trade bill is completely bad. On the contrary, it contains a number of good and important measures including new authority for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> negotiators seeking to open markets abroad. It also included my proposal for helping workers affected by business failings by providing them with training, education and job placement services, the truly humane approach. That's why I want a trade bill and why I so regret the addition of counterproductive measures that outweigh the positive features of this legislation. So I urge <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to schedule prompt action on a second trade bill immediately after it sustains my veto on this one. And now, one final message. At noon tomorrow in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hundreds will gather to pay tribute to police officers and other law enforcement officials who've died in the line of duty. So wherever you are at noon, I hope you'll join me in bowing your head and in resolving to let our law enforcement officials know that we understand what our mothers and fathers taught us _ the policeman is our friend.

The Argosy is under Iranian charter and the <LOCATION> Khark </LOCATION> is government owned. The attacks were part of an intensified effort by <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to cut off the export revenues that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> uses to finance the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, now in its eighth year. `` Penetrating Iranian enemy defenses, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> pilots struck at berthing supertankers off the island, setting them ablaze and gutted in fire. Columns of smoke were seen billowing from the hit targets,'' said the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, quoting a military communique. The raid was the third in the past seven months against <PERSON> Larak </PERSON>, where international tankers pick up oil cargoes brought from <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> by Iranian ships. To reach the Hormuz strait, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> jets must fly more than 750 miles each way, requiring mid-air refueling en route to or from the target. Five tankers also were hit in the last Larak raid, on Dec. 22, among them the Seawise Giant, which was damaged in the first raid last October. Both Seawise Giant and <ORGANIZATION> Burmah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endeavour </ORGANIZATION>, also one of the world's five largest vessels, are under charter to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as `` mother ships,'' or offshore storage tankers, at <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> More than 500 ships have been damaged in the war, most of them since it spilled into the gulf in 1984. Since the start of 1986, about 300 commercial ships have been hit by one side or the other. Estimates by maritime agencies and other sources indicate that more than 300 seamen have been killed and many injured. The Larak raid came hours after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Navy-escorted convoy of three Kuwaiti tankers sailed through the Hormuz into the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> without incident. It was the 31st convoy of the year. One of the escorting warships, the destroyer Stump, later returned to the gulf, passing through the strait where the smoke of <PERSON> Larak </PERSON>'s fires were still visible. Earlier in the day, gulf-based sources quoted radio monitors as saying an Iranian fighter plane had warned a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship to leave an area in the southern gulf, but there was no reply. An American source said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had overheard an Iranian F-4 fighter-bomber `` requesting permission to attack a ship.'' The source, speaking on condition he not be named, said there were no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships in that immediate vicinity at the time. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reported that it would soon begin 10 days of maneuvers in the southern gulf and the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. No specific date was given for the exercises, the first since the Iranians lost six naval craft in clashes with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces on April 18. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted the commander of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>, Rear Adm. <PERSON> Mohammad-Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Malekzadegan </PERSON>, as saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s naval forces had `` increased several times'' since the The April 18 fighting, which began with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reprisal attacks on three Iranian oil platforms, cost <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> two of its best frigates and a fast patrol boat. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed 44 of its men were killed. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter gunship and its two-man crew were lost. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> customarily retaliates for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s raids by attacking commercial ships in the gulf on a one-for-one basis. It has carried out only one attack since the April 18 clashes, and none since the recent wave of Iraqi raids began.

<HEAD>Reagan Poised to Veto Trade Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Saturday that while workers should get as much warning as possible before they're fired or laid off, he can not sign a trade bill requiring such notification because it `` threatens to destroy jobs.'' `` It is unfortunate, but I have no choice but to send this back to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of the 1,000-page trade measure. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the veto would occur in the coming week. In his weekly radio address, delivered from Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> zeroed in on the battle over the plant-closing section of the bill, which is expected to become a campaign issue in the fall elections. While the administration supports much of the bill, it faults the requirement that companies notify workers at least 60 days in advance of layoffs or a plant shutdown. The issue should be decided between labor and management, not government, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> argued. `` Let me state very clearly, I believe businesses should give workers and communities just as much warning as they can when it looks as though layoffs or plant closings are going to become unavoidable,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` It's the humane thing to do.'' `` But when big government gets in the middle of something like this, dictating all its rules and regulations, the humane way has a way of becoming inhumane,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president contended that the requirement would force struggling businesses to shut down at crucial times, and that management needs the flexibility of using temporary layoffs to get a business back on its feet. It would also keep companies from adding workers if it would subject them to the bill's requirements, the president said. Although there are exceptions in the bill for companies that find themselves in serious financial trouble, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> derided them as `` too vague and unclear to be workable.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> argued that `` one independent study'' showed that if the plant-closing provision had been in effect from 1982 to 1986, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> would have almost half a million fewer jobs.'' He did not cite the source of the study. In the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the nation needs the bill to combat the worst trade deficit in history _ $ 171 billion. `` It weakens our country, depresses wages, reduces our standard of living,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> argued. He took issue with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s threat to veto the bill over the plant closing provision. `` This bill simply ... asks the nation's biggest employers to give American workers at least 60 days' notice before they close another plant. That's not too much to ask. Not sufficient cause, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, to abandon the work of three years and scrap this vitally needed legislation,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker contended that `` 86 percent of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people support this plant closing provision.'' `` Top management knows in advance when its service is no longer required and builds golden parachutes worth millions of dollars for its comfort. Ca n't we give the workers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at least 60 days to get their lives in order, to get new training, to cushion the blow?'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> asked. Democrats sent the bill to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week with a parade of razzle-dazzle events and photo sessions, and have threatened to hit Republicans in the fall with the issue if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoes the measure. The bill would overhaul the system for imposing import curbs to retaliate against international trade violations and aid American industries threatened by increased foreign competition. While it cleared the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by a 312-107 margin _ more than the two-thirds needed to override a presidential veto _ it was approved in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by 63-36, three votes shy of the margin sufficient to override.

 Here is the text of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address. It was delivered Saturday by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. Good afternoon. This is <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Let's talk a little bit together about the most important thing to come out of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year. The new trade bill we sent to the president this week can be a big victory for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It can help us get back on track to being No. 1 in the world. Last year, our country suffered the worst trade deficit in our history _ $ 171 billion. We paid that much more for foreign goods than we sold in American-made products. And that can be devastating. It weakens our country, depresses wages, reduces our standard of living. In all, the trade deficit cost the average American family about $ 3,000 last year. Because of this, we're no longer No. 1 in per capita gross national product. Last year we fell to No. 3. Because of these trade deficits, our country, which was the No. 1 creditor nation in the world just five years ago, is the world's largest debtor nation today And foreign ownership of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks, American farms and real estate, and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s marketable securities increases by about 25 percent each year. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can do better than that. We must do better than that. The new trade bill will put us on an upward path. Its contents are summed up in three important words _ rules, tools and schools. New rules to make a level playing field, to give <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> products a chance on foreign markets. We ask other countries to treat our goods just as we treat their goods on our markets _ no better, no worse. New tools to strengthen our industrial base, to modernize our plants, to improve our American productivity. Better schools to prepare <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children for increasing world competition and to hone and sharpen the skills of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s work force <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs this bill. And so we plead with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: Please sign the trade bill. Give <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a chance to excel on world markets again. Let `` Made in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'' become a badge of quality and value throughout the world. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has threatened to veto this bill simply because it asks the nation's biggest employers to give American workers at least 60 days' notice before they close another plant. That's not too much to ask. Not sufficient cause, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, to abandon the work of three years and scrap this vitally needed legislation. Eighty-six percent of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people support this plant closing provision, this notification to workers. They say it's only fair. Top management knows in advance when its service is no longer required and builds golden parachutes worth millions of dollars for its comfort. Ca n't we give the workers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at least 60 days to get their lives in order, to get new training, to cushion the blow? In the name of the 2 million American workers who lost their jobs last year because of plant shutdowns and layoffs _ many of those plants going overseas, two-thirds of them given no notice at all _ Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, we ask you to sign this bill and let it become law. In the name of <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and 117 employees who lost their jobs in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- with only one day notice, please sign the trade bill. In the name of <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrenko </PERSON> and 160 iron workers at a plant in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> -RRB- which closed with only 15 minutes' notice, please sign this bill, Mr. President. In the name of <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> and 397 workers who lost their jobs at a plant in <LOCATION> Eau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, please sign the bill. In the name of these and others in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s work force, good Americans who want to help us revive this country, we call on you, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, to consider the equities and let this vital American initiative begin.

 Anti-communist insurgents Saturday offered limited amnesty to Afghan government soldiers as Soviet troops prepared for the start of their withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gulbadin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, chairman of the seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance, said Afghan security forces who voluntarily surrender within four weeks after Soviet troops have left their districts would not be tried for war crimes. `` Once captured ... they will face Islamic courts,'' <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said at a news conference at the alliance's <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> headquarters. He did not say what punishments they would face if convicted. The insurgents have vowed to continue and intensify their fight until the last of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> falls. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said the rebels had postponed a swap of one Soviet prisoner for 25 captured guerrillas. He said his group will keep Soviet prisoners until it establishes an Islamic government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He did not divulge how many Soviet or Afghan army troops were being held. The leader of the extremist <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-E-Islami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said his party will hold onto Soviet prisoners and try to exchange them for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and other high-ranking members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>. He said the guerrillas want to put <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and his associates on trial for war crimes. Western observers disagree on how long <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> can stay in power once his 100,000-strong security force is left to face the guerrillas alone. The rebels claim to have overrun 50 posts and garrisons, mostly in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, in the last month as <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops have headed toward <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in preparation for their withdrawal, which begins Sunday. `` May 15 means the defeat of Soviet forces militarily in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the start of the puppet regime's collapse,'' said <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>. `` The <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> withdrawal is the first phase of our victory.'' `` May 15 also proves that in wars, modern weapons and number of troops do not matter,'' he said, adding, `` no power, however arrogant, is able to crush a nation committed to its faith.'' <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said the guerrillas would be willing to talk to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> advisers, who will oversee the nine-month Soviet troop withdrawal. The 50-man force, headed by Gen. <PERSON> Rauli </PERSON> <PERSON> Helminen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, is composed of military personnel mainly from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Good Offices Mission for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said that starting Sunday the group will inspect Soviet, <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> and guerrilla military bases in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and refugee camps in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The guerrilla alliance, composed of four Moslem extremist groups and three moderate traditionalist parties, has begun forming its own alternative government. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said the new Islamic-style government will establish itself inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in the near future. He has given no date. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s party seized power in a bloody 1978 coup. Soviet troops intervened in December 1979, replacing one pro-Moscow government with another.

 Bloodied but unbroken, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> begins pulling out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Sunday amid threats of guerrilla harassment and grave doubts about the future of the Marxist government it leaves behind. On the eve of the withdrawal, the Soviet commander in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> denied his men had been defeated in the brutal war that has claimed an estimated 10,000 Soviet lives. But politically, the fruits of the 8 -LCB- - year Soviet armed intervention seem meager Militarily, the Soviet presence has proved far from decisive. On Saturday, in the Afghan capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, a bomb exploded inside a truck near reviewing stands built for a ceremony honoring the departing Soviet troops. Eleven Afghan civilians were reported killed. Later, three rockets hit a village outside <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, killing four people. Since Dec. 27, 1979, when the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> sent tanks and troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Soviet soldiers have been fighting to prop up the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, but they have failed to break the back of a nationwide anti-Marxist insurgency. Acknowledging the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s unwillingness to keep bearing the military and diplomatic costs of the intervention, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> signed U.N.-brokered accords in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on April 14 that commit the Soviets to a nine-month pullout, beginning Sunday. As the first of an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops prepare to come home, one major question is how _ or if _ the Moscow-aligned regime of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, which claims just 40,000 regular soldiers of its own, can survive. The first Soviets to leave will be from a motor-rifle division garrisoned at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, a dusty provincial town 30 miles from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border, military officials and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media have said. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, Soviet commander in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said Saturday more than 1,000 soldiers would leave <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> on Sunday and that a quarter of the entire Soviet contingent would be home by the time President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on May 29-June 2. In recent days, Soviet media have issued alarming reports about increasing guerrilla activity, perhaps to ready public opinion for losses during the withdrawal, or to stress that the pullout will heighten the likelihood of bloodshed among the Afghan factions locked in a 10-year-old civil war. Soviet television took its viewers Thursday to the <LOCATION> Kabul-Kandahar-Herat </LOCATION> road, a 650-mile crescent-shaped track that links three of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s major cities, for a taped interview with a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officer assigned to screen the pullout. `` The activity of armed opposition bands has been sharply increasing,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> N.V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, who spoke as a truck convoy crawled along the hilly road in back of him. `` The road will apparently become an objective for which they will fight till the bitter end.'' Guerrilla commanders, who refused to be party to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements, have vowed to give the Soviets no respite during the pullout. <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, head of the seven-party rebel alliance, offered a limited amnesty to Afghan forces who surrender within four weeks after Soviet troops leave their districts. He said Saturday in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that those who surrendered in time would not be tried for war crimes. But he said those who do n't surrender and are captured will face Islamic courts <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, who spoke at a news conference in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, said the rebels had recently received antitank weapons, but warned: `` If any group tries to use any weapons, retribution will be quick and severe.'' Asked if the pullout was a defeat, the 44-year-old commander said: `` The Soviet Army will return home after fulfilling its internationalist duty ... During the war, not a single unit retreated in the face of the enemy, so we can not speak of a military defeat.'' <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>'s remarks were made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a pool report from the British news agency <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> was excluded from the pool because of questions it asked <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> in the Afghan capital last month. Most of the Soviets will be traveling by land, rather than by airlift. For some convoys, the trek to Soviet border cities like <LOCATION> Termez </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kushka </LOCATION> is expected to take three days or more, often through rugged, mountainous terrain where the rebels have been active in the past. Air cover for the retreating columns may be a crucial problem, as the insurgents have U.S.-made Stinger missiles, deadly against low-flying helicopters and planes. Fearing the heat-seating Stinger, the Soviets and Afghans in 1986 virtually ceased using their aircraft for ground support missions. As they withdraw, the Soviets will hand over more than 170 military bases with equipment worth $ 1 billion to their <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> allies, <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, 41, a burly, mustachioed Marxist who is a former head of the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> secret police, has scoffed when asked whether the departure of his Soviet allies will bring about the downfall of his government. However, many of the dozens of posts handed over to his army in recent weeks reportedly have been overrun by well-armed guerrillas. Soviet media reports have said Soviet soldiers believe they have honorably performed their duty in coming to the support of a beleagured government, but the media have made no secret of the men's desire to return home. In the television interview, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, whose detachment will protect other units as they withdraw, pointed to his men and said: `` They say we will certainly envy the first columns that go home.''

<HEAD>GOP Senate Leaders See Good Chance for Shrinking Budget Deficit</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Republican leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reassured the nation's top business executives Saturday that the outlook is good for shrinking the federal budget deficit. The Business Council, composed of 61 chief executives of the nation's largest corporations, heard from Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., as the group wrapped up a two-day conference The sessions of the elite council are private, but <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> told reporters before speaking to the executives, `` I'm not one of those who is going to go before this business group and predict gloom and fear.'' <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> is ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a member of a national bipartisan commission that began meeting last week to devise ways to lower the deficit. The business executives, as they opened their twice-a-year conference at The Homestead, a plush resort in the mountains of southwestern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, issued a generally upbeat assessment of the nation's economic prospects this year, but warned that the budget deficit remains `` disturbingly high'' during such a period of good times. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a health care corporation, said many business leaders enjoying the moderate economic growth have a sense of `` living on borrowed time'' because of government red ink. `` I think most of us still regard the budget deficit as the No. 1 problem facing us,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilpatrick </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> CIGNA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an insurance company. The executives, in a forecast representing a consensus of member corporation's chief economists, said that the budget deficit would rise from $ 150.2 billion last year to $ 154 billion both this year and in 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates the deficit will be $ 157 billion in 1988. But <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> said `` we've made significant strides'' and predicted the government would `` very easily'' meet the $ 136 billion, 1989 target of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. He said he did not want to prematurely divulge the positions he will be taking in the deliberations of the national commission. But, he said, `` I do n't think it's as simple, as some are saying, that we ought to just look out there for some big tax, just so it's not income or corporate income tax.'' `` We better be guarded about taxes with the American economy doing as well as it is,'' he said. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, who is deputy Republican leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, spoke to the executives Friday night. He told reporters Saturday that the government must limit the growth of federal entitlement programs to achieve any meaningful reduction in the deficit. `` When we deal honestly with <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, Social Security, veteran's benefits, then we'll get something done. All else is dancing in the night,' he said. He said he believed the national commission would propose a sensible package because the co-chairmen, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, `` are pretty gutsy guys.'' On another matter, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said he was optimistic that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, despite a tight schedule, will pass a second and better trade bill after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoes the bill sent to him last week. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said two key Democratic leaders, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, were unlikely to let the legislation die because of strong support in their home state for repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil, which is included in the massive trade bill. The president is expected to reject the legislation because of a provision that would require companies to give 60 days notice of plant closings and major layoffs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who went before the business group on Friday, said the plant closing provision was `` onerous'' because it would provide a legal basis for challenging virtually every closing or layoff.

 <ORGANIZATION> BURJ </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> India-Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ As night falls on the rugged frontier, the rattle of guns of Indian border guards serves as a warning to potential Sikh infiltrators and arms merchants who try to cross into <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The guards take target practice 500 yards from the frontier to warm up for the nightlong vigil. In the past eight weeks, at least 56 people have died in 47 encounters between Indian <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and would-be infiltrators or arms smugglers. `` The days of the war game are over. We are faced with a situation where we must stop infiltration from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> by any means,'' border force Inspector General <PERSON> Parkash </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said at the <LOCATION> Burj </LOCATION> border post in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> wants to close the border with fences, men and strict vigilance. The urgency to seal the 348-mile section of border in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> stems from escalating violence in the state, where hundreds of people have died in <LOCATION> Sikh </LOCATION> separatist violence this year. Sikh militants have been fighting since 1982 for an independent Sikh homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> stretches 1,836 miles, running through the Indian states of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION>. It is a nervous border. Both nations station military forces in nearby garrisons in memory of the three wars they have fought in the last 41 years. `` It is like firecrackers strewn all over the place. What is needed is just a matchstick to start full-scale confrontation,'' a border official told journalists who were taken to the border on a government tour for foreign news organizations. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The Sikh terrorist campaign has prompted the Indian government to take drastic steps. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of sheltering and arming the Sikhs, charges repeatedly denied by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. An estimated 15,000 Indian border guards are deployed along the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> sector of the frontier. In addition, 40,000 Indian army men are garrisoned in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, subject to call-up on two hours' notice. Reporters saw Indian foot patrols in full combat readiness at <LOCATION> Burj </LOCATION>, 26 miles west of the <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> holy city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. At a nearby 100-foot high observation tower, two guards were looking through binoculars and keeping their foot patrols informed about movement on the Pakistani side. After sundown, the tower guards use night-vision devises. Whenever a potential infiltrator is spotted, the patrols are alerted. They first ask the would-be infiltrators to stop and identify themselves. `` We give them a one-minute response time. If they try to run or fail to respond, we fire,'' said <PERSON> Vijendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirohi </PERSON>, the border force's deputy inspector general for the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> sector. In an effort to stop infiltration, the Indian government has started fencing vulnerable sections with barbed wire. Senior officers in charge of border operations and intelligence say Sikh violence can only be contained if infiltration from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is checked. `` The oxygen for the Sikh terrorists is coming from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. If we can stop the oxygen supply, terrorism will die,'' said <PERSON> Saran </PERSON> <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON>, chief of operations at the border force's headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. `` Before we would have hesitated to name <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, but now it is as clear as daylight _ I mean their help to terrorists,'' <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> said. Reporters were shown arms and ammunition the officers said were captured from infiltrators. The weapons included rocket-propelled grenade launchers, Soviet-designed AK-47 rifles and pistols. `` It is the AK-47 that worries us the most,'' <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has nothing to match the AK-47, whose firepower and light weight make it an ideal weapon for untrained gunmen. Border troops are equipped with single-shot rifles, in addition to light machine guns that must be mounted before firing.

<HEAD>Calls For Death Of Tiger Involved In Fatal Mauling Worry Zoo
Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Zoo officials posted an extra guard and took tigers and other large cats off public display after receiving telephone calls demanding death for a Siberian tiger that killed a zoo keeper. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Zoo officials said Friday that they have no plans to kill or transfer <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON>, the 450-pound Siberian tiger that fatally mauled <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON> on Thursday. No one saw or heard the attack on <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>, but officials said the tiger apparently smashed through a reinforced, wire-and-glass window and dragged <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON> outside before killing him. `` This is a wild animal,'' said parks department director <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. `` It's not a domesticated animal. One of the purposes of a zoo is to preserve species, and tigers are not a domesticated species.'' The tigers and other cats would be kept off display at least until Monday, <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said. `` We're leaving them off display to let things settle down,'' he said. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said he did n't know what was said in the phone calls, but that the calls came from people who wanted the tiger killed. Officials have said that the animal, which is on the endangered species list, poses no danger to the public. While some were calling for <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON>'s death, several zoo visitors vigorously defended the tiger on Friday. `` I'm sorry for the man. But, I do n't think he would have wanted it destroyed,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON>. <PERSON> Suzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, 23, who has a special interest in big cats and goes to the zoo regularly, said: `` I do n't want to be mean, but I think it was more human stupidity. They knew that animal was dangerous. Obviously, I think more caution should have been taken.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Warrendorf </PERSON>, 52, a night keeper-watchman at the zoo, said he heard negative comments from a few visitors walking by the exhibit area where <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON> was killed. `` They were wondering why the cat was n't killed, among other things,'' <PERSON> Warrendorf </PERSON> said. `` That's the number one question I hear: What are they going to do with the cat?''' <PERSON> Warrendorf </PERSON> said many people `` seem to act as if they want revenge.'' `` We do n't know what to expect with the nature of people and the nature of animals,'' he said.

<HEAD>Debate Rages Over Bringing Quebec Back Into the Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The deal between French and <LOCATION> English </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to recognize <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> as a `` distinct society'' and bring it back into the Constitution has bogged down in arguments over minority and women's rights and the future of the nation's political system. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> and other critics want last year's agreement scrapped. <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>, a leader in creating the nation's new Constitution in 1982, says the pact could lead to the breakup of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s federation of provinces. Others want the accord renegotiated. Women's groups, the country's 500,000 Indians and Eskimos, and language minorities in several provinces want their rights enshrined in the Constitution. The <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territories </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Yukon </PERSON> claim the deal makes it virtually impossible for them to become provinces. The accord's importance stems from <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s refusal to sign the 1982 Constitution because it failed specifically to protect the province's French culture. Despite all the critics, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> Premier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> thinks he can persuade the country to ratify the agreement, which was signed by the federal government and the 10 Canadian provinces a year ago at <LOCATION> Meech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. But his chief provincial ally, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> Premier <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, says there's only a 50-50 chance. `` I would n't bet the family farm on it,'' he said recently. However, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> warned that `` the political consequences of not signing this could be very severe. `` It will be an enormous political risk for the country to refuse it. We do n't need it to survive, but we do for political stability,'' he said. The risk of unrest is n't always apparent in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. The mainly French-speaking province has evolved in the past decade from a bastion of French separatism into a prosperous society of 6.6 million people. The turning point was the rejection, by a 6-to-4 margin, of a 1980 referendum to open talks on a limited form of independence. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maule </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consul general in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, describes today's sprawling city of 2.9 million as one of entrepreneurs and yuppies, not political extremists. He said the 81-percent French-speaking majority feels more secure about its fate on an English-speaking continent. First posted here in 1976, <PERSON> Maule </PERSON> said: `` In those days, if you went into a store and said `` hello'' to someone, they'd glare at you. Now, if they greet you first in French, they apologize and say ` hello' right back.'' Yet it does n't take much to revive the old <LOCATION> Anglo-French </LOCATION> antagonisms. About 25,000 French Quebecers marched through the streets last month to proclaim the inviolability of the province's French-only language law. The protesters reacted after <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> wavered over an election promise to permit bilingual business signs and after two Western provinces diluted French minority rights. Today's French-speaking Quebecers, who number about 5 million, descend from settlers who followed on the heels of 16th and 17th century French explorers. Once called <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> came under British control after a defeat of French soldiers on the bank of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in 1759. All parties initially hailed Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s skillful negotiation of the <ORGANIZATION> Meech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> accord, and the deal was ratified Oct. 26 by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. The pact has been approved by four of 10 provinces: <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION> and Prince <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON>. But with a June 1990 deadline for unanimous assent, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> Premier <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON> opposes the pact, a minority government in <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> lacks the votes to pass it, and four other provinces have delayed ratification. Meanwhile, the country's main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is sharply divided over <ORGANIZATION> Meech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> and seeks amendments. In addition to the `` distinct society'' clause for <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Meech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> gives provinces new powers in the appointment of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges and senators and the right to opt out of national shared-cost programs. <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> says such a scenario could shatter the Canadian federation. Other critics say the phrase `` distinct society'' is ill-defined and will cause endless litigation over the division of federal and provincial powers. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> says objections can be taken up at later constitutional talks. `` <LOCATION> Meech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> will pass the way it is. This is an undertaking we gave to the people of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the people of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>,'' he said. But <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> did not close the door to changes. `` I'm prepared to look at anything,'' he told reporters. This pledge upset <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>, who argued that unanimous consent for change is now impossible. He said native rights and other matters can be dealt with separately and that a constitutional provision requires consent from only seven provinces or those representing 50 percent of the population. `` In reopening the deal, they will kill the deal and keep <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> outside the Constitution,'' he said.

 In the hours after his car plunged off the bridge at <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> wanted to tell police that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> was alone in the car, according to a new book about the accident. In an account attributed to <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> cousin <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> and a friend, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, the morning after the accident that `` I'm going to say that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> was driving.'' <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> drowned in the accident, which has shadowed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s political career for 19 years The book, by <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Damore </PERSON>, is `` Senatorial Privilege: The Chappaquiddick Coverup,'' and is purportedly based, in part, on the first extensive interviews <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> has ever given for publication. <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> went with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to the bridge shortly after the accident to try to rescue <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> from the submerged car. A statement issued by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said: `` As the record shows, no reputable publisher would touch this book. The charges about senator <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> are false. The book is an irresponsible rehash of all the old rumor and innuendo, and we have no intention of making any further comment.'' <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON>, a lawyer who is now a member of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, did not return repeated telephone calls over the past week. Contacted recently by the <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, he said: `` My God, that was 19 years ago. It's just not worthy of discussing anymore.'' The book is being published by <ORGANIZATION> Regnery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gateway </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative publishing house based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, after being rejected by a number of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> publishers. <PERSON> Damore </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saybrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, is a former <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> resident who has written several books, including a flattering account of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s years on the cape. <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had given <PERSON> Damore </PERSON> a $ 250,000 contract, but canceled it, saying an early version of the book was too unwieldy and that the author failed to provide tape recordings to authenticate the <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> interviews. Penthouse magazine canceled an excerpt plan on ground that <PERSON> Damore </PERSON> could n't verify key parts of the <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> interviews. But <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> campaign aide and now a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview that he was present for nearly all of the <LOCATION> Damore-Gargan </LOCATION> sessions, in 1983. He declined to go over specifics, but vouched for the book's accuracy. <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> also read the book and made corrections prior to publication, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. According to <PERSON> Damore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> told him <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> concocted the proposal that authorities be told <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> was alone in the senator's Oldsmobile when it plunged off tiny Dike Bridge over an inlet on the east side of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> island. The accident occurred the weekend of July 18-19, 1969. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> was one of six women known as the `` boiler room girls'' who had worked on <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s 1968 presidential campaigns and who attended a party <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> had organized. `` <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was having alternative ideas about the situation,'' wrote author <PERSON> Damore </PERSON>. `` Why could n't <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> have been driving the car? Why could n't she have let him off and driven to the ferry herself and made a wrong turn?'' `` <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> asked to be brought back to the cottage to establish the story. After a while he could leave. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> suggested that when he was back -LRB- in <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> could ` discover' the accident and report to police that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> had been alone in the car.'' But <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> purportedly rejected the idea, noting that the trio did not even know if Miss <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> could drive or had a license. The senator testified at an official inquest that he `` had full intention of reporting'' the accident when the trio returned to the <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> ferry landing and the senator swam back to <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> alone. But he said the tide was pulling him out and `` for the second time that evening I knew I was going to drown.'' The next morning <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> arrived at the <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> hotel to find a freshly shaven and neatly dressed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> chatting with several acquaintances about sailing on the hotel balcony. He had not reported the accident. `` I told them about my own thoughts and feelings as I swam across that channel ... that somehow when they arrived in the morning that they were going to say that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> was still alive,'' the senator has said. The book said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not decide to tell police that he was driving until speaking by telephone with aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>. It took about 10 hours for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to report the accident, an action that he later called `` irrational and indefensible and inexcusable and inexplicable.'' The senator pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident. He received a two-month suspended sentence and had his license revoked for a year. A manuscript of the book, which is scheduled to be published June 23, was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Washingtonian magazine said it plans to run excerpts in its June issue. The book quotes <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> as saying to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, in 1982, `` I've given you 30 years of my life and what do I have to show for it I'm a fool in the eyes of my own children because of <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, who did not talk to the author, declined comment. The book, reporting the scene on the night of the accident, said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> watched <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>'s rescue operation and called out: `` Can you see her? Is she in there'?'' The account continued: `` <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> saw the senator stretched out on the bridge on his back. Hands clapsed behind his head, knees drawn up, the senator was looking into the sky, rocking back and forth, repeating, ` Oh my God. What am I going to do'?''

 The first person arrested under new regulations banning smoking on short airline flights says he's willing to plead guilty to smoking but would fight any more serious charge.

Regulations that went into effect three weeks ago ban smoking on domestic airliner flights lasting less than two hours. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Elly </PERSON> <PERSON> Brekke </PERSON> said <PERSON> Seigel </PERSON> is apparently the first passenger to be arrested under the new rules. The lack of an alarm from the lavatory smoke detector caused the flight crew to suspect it was tampered with, <PERSON> Brekke </PERSON> said. It was given to maintenance workers for an inspection. But <PERSON> Seigel </PERSON> said of the smoke detector, `` I touched it, that's all, but I did not do anything other than look at it out of curiousity. <PERSON> Brekke </PERSON> said the investigation should take 60 days, and <PERSON> Seigel </PERSON> faces three possible charges: Smoking when a no smoking sign is on, which carries a $ 1,000 fine; smoking in the lavatory, also a $ 1,000 fine; and tampering with a lavatory smoke detector, a $ 2,000 fine.

He is now dean of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` You ca n't run a democracy when the economy is going to hell,'' he said. Since the early 1980s, money has steadily flowed out of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, depriving the underdeveloped nations of desperately needed capital, says the study, which was released Friday. By the end of 1987, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was staggering under a debt burden of $ 460 billion. The authors say the region is mired in its worst depression since the 1930s. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s elected President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, who has had to put down attempted military coups, frequently warns the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that his region's economic troubles threaten its political stability. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy has ignored the deeper problems, concentrating instead on battling communism in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said. `` There has been almost an obssession with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to the exclusion of everything else,'' <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said. `` In the absolute worst case, we could send troops into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ but we ca n't send them into every country in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The other dominant theme in U.S.-Latin relations has been narcotics trafficking, says <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagley </PERSON>, who specializes in international relations and prepared the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Report II section on drug trafficking. He pointed to the inability of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to either unseat or prosecute <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug charges. `` Our argument is that there are many other problems equally fundamental,'' <PERSON> Bagley </PERSON> said in a separate interview Friday. `` By failing to deal with these problems, the Noriegas of the world can flourish.'' Even in fighting the traffickers, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has failed to come up with concrete anti-drug aid to financially strapped countries, or with programs to cut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand, <PERSON> Bagley </PERSON> said. But cocaine rhetoric and get-tough policies _ instead of deeper economic issues _ dominate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, he said. `` This is a lost decade for democracy and development in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bagley </PERSON> said. The report acknowledges it is timed for the 1988 presidential elections, and calls on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> voters to demand more substance in the candidates' <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy. A section of the report by Msgr. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archdiocese also calls for a more realistic immigration policy, criticizing the government for narrowing its definition of political asylum to thwart Latin and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> immigrants. Miami Report II's main focus is economic, however, and the authors offer what they say are moderate policies to curb the departure of capital from the region. They call for Latin American nations themselves to adopt internal policies that reassure investors. <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, with a foreign debt of $ 53 billion, has `` flight capital'' of $ 39 billion deposited outside the country by Argentines worried about the nation's political and economic health. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy _ or lack of it _ takes a large share of the blame, the report says, and must be changed. One suggestion is for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates on loans made directly to smaller countries. Another is for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to increase funding available for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> through the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>UI Team Helping India Develop Buddhist Sites For Tourism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 University of Illinois landscape architects are working on designs to help the government of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> attract more tourists to key Buddhist religious sites. University officials will go to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> this summer to present plans for redeveloping <PERSON> Sarnath </PERSON>, where <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> delivered his first sermon more than 2,500 years ago. `` It gives our students hands-on experience, and it is an exciting challenge to develop tourism there,'' said <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellafiore </PERSON>, head of the university's Department of Landscape Architecture. `` People can see a totally different religion and culture.'' <PERSON> Sarnath </PERSON>, in the northern part of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, contains landmark structures such as a temple, a museum and architectural ruins. But, there also are mud houses, cycle rickshaws, and streets lined with vendors selling everything from silk to peanuts. One goal for the university team was to create designs that suit both religious and recreational activities at <LOCATION> Sarnath </LOCATION> and would cut down conflicts between the two. `` Some people come for religious devotion,'' said <PERSON> Bellafiore </PERSON>. `` Others picnic on the grass next to the temple with a ghetto-blaster and barbecue meat, and that is very offensive.'' So, the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> students and faculty visited <PERSON> Sarnath </PERSON> and returned with pictures and ideas, then spent months on campus early this year developing plans for improving the site. Graduate student <PERSON> Miki </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuebe </PERSON> concentrated on the zoo, creating more natural settings for animals in place of the small cages now used. For example, one of her drawings depicts an island for the zoo's monkeys. `` We want to tie into <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> concepts like compassion for all living things,'' she said. One alternative in the plan calls for moving the zoo away from the key religious area. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Blume-Weaver </PERSON>, another graduate student, rolled out a drawing of proposed new footpaths intended to keep people from walking on the architectural ruins. Around some <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> structures, the plans show two paths _ one for religious pilgrims who spend much more time there, and another for tourists who want to walk past more quickly. In other areas of <LOCATION> Sarnath </LOCATION>, the plans along a main road include trees more typical of those found during <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>'s time, concepts for tourist-related market spaces and hedges to restrict the movement of farm animals into the site. For overnight tourists, there are concepts for new housing designed to blend in with the architecture of the current village. `` We do n't want a chichi resort in the midst of abject poverty,'' said <PERSON> Bellafiore </PERSON>, who hopes the housing will be decorated with pottery and weavings by village craftsmen to help the local economy. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> agreed on this project. The only cost was transportation and food and lodging in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for the university team, said <PERSON> Bellafiore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bellafiore </PERSON> said he will return to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> with other university officials to deliver the designs that will provide the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> government with alternatives that are `` not enormously expensive.'' `` I think our plans will satisfy <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s goal to increase tourism,'' said <PERSON> Blume-Weaver </PERSON>. `` I'd also like to see the ruins better preserved, and I'd like to see the place respected more as a religious site.'' Similar designs may be developed by the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> team for other <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> sites in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Michelangelo Scholar Says Artist Had Help Painting Sistine Chapel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> was not, contrary to popular belief, an angry loner who spent countless hours lying flat on his back as he painted the ceiling of the <ORGANIZATION> Sistine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapel </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> art historian concludes. In fact, the Italian Renaissance master did his work standing on innovative scaffolding, and he had help from as many as 13 assistants, says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, assistant professor of art history. `` One of the larger myths about him is that he was incapable of working with others,'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said Friday. `` But the fact is that for very large projects it was necessary to work with assistants.'' `` I think of him as something of an entrepreneur ... a fairly efficient businessman,'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. `` It's just another side of an artist who's constantly surprising us.'' Depicting the biblical story of creation on the chapel's ceiling was not without discomfort, however. <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> described his painting position _ on his feet, head tilted back _ to a friend in this way: `` My beard toward Heaven, I feel the back of my brain upon my neck.'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> spent last year in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> on a grant from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION> researching <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> and studying the ceiling, which is undergoing a major renovation. Workers are using a special, mild solvent to remove layers of dirt, candle smoke and even <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> wine, which was once used to brighten the colors. `` It's truly stunning,'' said <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, who climbed the scaffolding four times, as the restorers worked to bring out the work's true colors, for leisurely close-up looks. `` I think the thing that's most important is the coloration,'' he said. `` Although it comes as a surprise to some people, it's really probably exactly as <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> intended it. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> used vibrant colors so they could be seen from the floor, 65 feet below. Now that he's back home, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> is working on a book about <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> and the assistants he used on his major works. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, he spent hours compiling scattered information on the Sistine project, which took from 1508 to 1512, and came up with a list of 13 assistants who helped <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON>. An architect friend helped design the overhead scaffolding and a carpenter named <PERSON> Piero </PERSON> <PERSON> Basso </PERSON> built it, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> also hired assistants to grind colors, mix paints, trim and clean brushes, and take care of other mundane tasks, and he recruited other artists and instructed them in the technique of fresco painting. Some historians have believed <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> had help in the project, but workers cleaning the ceiling in the 1930s were the first to notice the tell-tale details, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. He thinks his book will be the first to provide an overall picture of <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON>'s assistants in the Sistine Chapel. `` Examination of the ceiling from the scaffold clearly reveals the presence of helping hands, especially painting in the architecture, decoration and many of the secondary figures,'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. `` Much of the architecture, for example, was a reptititous task that required competence but no imagination, and the presence of more than one hand is particularly evident when viewed at close range,'' he said. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said the myths about <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> painting alone will probably continue, however, because `` they are fictions that attempt to grasp a superhuman achievement.'' But knowing he had a little help `` does not in any way detract from the greatness of the work of art.'' `` Rather, it is to the credit of his genius that the final product is a unified work of art.''

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was jeered Saturday as he appealed for votes from homosexual political activists, some of whom confronted him for supporting a policy making it difficult for gay couples to be foster parents. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, speaking to several dozen people at a meeting of a gay political action committee, promised, `` You're going to be deeply involved in what we do.'' However, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was confronted over a policy in his state giving low priority to homosexual couples as foster parents. The policy gives higher priority to heterosexual couples with children and relatives of the child needing placement. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, campaigning for gay support in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s June 7 primary, was met with some hisses and occasional shouts of protest as he explained his position on foster care. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also pointed to his record of support for spending money to combat the deadly AIDS disease, whose chief victims have been homosexual men. He also said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> spends more money per AIDS case than any other state. He called AIDS `` the most serious public health problem we've had in our lifetime. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he had vetoed legislation as governor that banned homosexual couples from providing foster care, but said he backed the policy in effect that gives first priority to heterosexual couples with child raising experience, and above that, relatives of the child in need of care. When asked repeatedly why he favored that policy, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` because I think it's best, all things being equal, for a child to grow up in a household with a mother and father and other children.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added that his policy does not prohibit gays from becoming foster parents if they are best for the child, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides acknowledged the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> policy effectively prevents gays from becoming foster parents in most cases. A handful of protesters greeted the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor outside a hotel. Inside, one man shouted, `` bigot,'' and another yelled, `` You're anti-gay. Why do n't you admit it?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was warmly endorsed by <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>, executive director of a group called <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocates </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have in <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a candidate who is instinctively supportive, who has a good record on gay rights, who wants our support and who can win,'' she said. `` Let's stop comparing <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and start comparing him with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would not support an executive order banning discrimination based on sexual orientation, but said he believed such discrimination was already prohibited by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides said they were pleased with the meeting despite the protests. `` I thought it was very good, very open. I thought Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dealt with the community's concerns very honestly,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, the campaign's national political coordinator. At a news conference later in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded to criticism from Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the expected <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee, who has blasted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for opposing weapons systems and said the Democrat's approach to defense amounted to `` wishful thinking.'' `` Anybody who sat there and did nothing while we traded arms to the Ayatollah -LRB- <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> -RRB- had better not be lecturing other people about naivete and wishful thinking,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also faced questions on his opposition to the death penalty as he appeared with <LOCATION> Californa </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>, who endorsed him. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said he opposed the death penalty, `` because I do n't believe in killing people. There are other ways of stopping violent crime.''

 Masked Arab youths battled <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in the occupied territories Saturday after the military lifted a travel ban. An Arab report said four protesters were savagely beaten by soldiers and dumped on a highway. A 16-year-old Palestinian was shot in the leg in the fighting between stone-throwing Palestinians and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. The clashes came after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ended a 29-hour closure of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and eased travel restrictions in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. A top <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official said the civil disobedience campaign against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation had failed. `` We certainly noticed some fatigue,'' said <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goren </PERSON>, policy coordinator for the occupied territories. <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> treated seven Palestinians for beating injuries after Saturday's clashes, doctors there said. An Arab reporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said four of them were dumped by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers along <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s main highway after they were clubbed. The four, ranging in age from 16 to 22, told the reporter they were detained during protests in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, then beaten and thrown out of a truck several miles away. The army said it was checking the reports. Authorities had sealed <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and blocked West Bank Arabs from entering <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on Friday to prevent Moslems from praying at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s main mosques on the last sabbath of the Moslem holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> underground leaders, who have orchestrated strikes by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> merchants, permitted <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> shops to open for several hours Saturday so Moslems could stock up for the three-day holiday marking the end of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Shati refugee camp, soldiers opened fire to disperse stone-throwing demonstrators, wounding a 16-year-old Palestinian in the leg, said doctors at <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The army said it was checking that report. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, about 60 masked <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths erected roadblocks of burning tires and threw stones at soldiers in the main street. Troops dispersed the crowd with tear gas and rubber bullets. <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON> said he was attacked by two soldiers when he photographed them arresting a teen-age Arab demonstrator. <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON> said the soldiers punched him five or six times in the head and kicked him in the thighs. <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON> said he was not seriously hurt. The army said it was investigating. In a radio interview, <PERSON> Goren </PERSON> acknowledged that the majority of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> still backed the uprising, which has entered its sixth month and claimed the lives of 187 Arabs and two Israelis. But he said the main objective of the Palestinian civil disobedience campaign _ breaking the hold of the military government in the occupied territories with tax boycotts, underground schools, and other means _ has failed. `` The main goal of the campaign was to establish alternative systems,'' <PERSON> Goren </PERSON> said. `` This has not happened until today, and we will not allow it to happen.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied the territories since the 1967 Middle East War. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Menahem </PERSON> <PERSON> Raboy </PERSON> announced that schools in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Arab sector would reopen May 22 after being closed since Feb. 4. Military officials have said they were considering reopening schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> after the end of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> but have not set a date. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools have been closed for five months. Schools in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the occupied territories frequently have been the site of anti-Israeli protests.

<TEXT>
 A 70-pound girl whose kite took her on an unscheduled flight returned Saturday to her liftoff site and managed to stay on the ground as she launched a new set of kite safety rules. <PERSON> DeAndra </PERSON> <PERSON> Anrig </PERSON>'s appearance ended a ban on kite flying at Shoreline Park after the 8-year-old's kite string snagged on a passing airplane March 20 and carried her 10 feet off the ground for at least 100 feet. The third-grader from <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> still has deep bruises on her back but was so excited about Saturday's event that she could n't sleep Friday night, according to her mother, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON>. She flew a stunt kite for about a minute before it fell to the grass. `` It feels fun,'' <PERSON> DeAndra </PERSON> said shyly to a crowd of reporters, who outnumbered other spectators. `` It was fun just to get the kite up in the air and flying it.'' She warned other children not to fly kites next to nearby <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, from which planes were taking off and landing over the park. But, she added: `` I want to fly again even though I was hurt.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyles </PERSON>, the city's Shoreline manager, had said it was appropriate to have <PERSON> DeAndra </PERSON> be the first to officially fly a kite after the regulations were revised. Greeting her today with a pat on the head, he said with a laugh, `` You've caused me a lot of work the last month.'' The story of <PERSON> DeAndra </PERSON>'s flight was relayed around the world by the news media, which dubbed her <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Poppins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> the Pooh and the Flying Nun. The plane sustained minor damage in the runin with the kite, but landed safely. The city's new guidelines for kite flying at the park, which is located near both the airport and <LOCATION> Moffett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, include a ban on flying kites higher than 150 feet. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> made no ruling as to who was at fault in March when <PERSON> DeAndra </PERSON> was snagged by the airplane, according to <PERSON> Lyles </PERSON>. The city's report indicates that the kite was between 200 and 250 feet in the air, but the pilot who struck the kite claimed to be at 700 feet, he said.

<TEXT>
 People pushing baby strollers, holding toddlers and carrying union signs gathered Saturday near the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument in support of so-called `` family'' legislation for working parents and the elderly. `` Hurrah, hurrah for the American family,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., 87, the oldest member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a champion of bills to expand job and medical benefits for working parents and senior citizens The rally was sponsored by a coalition of labor organizations, and religious, civil rights and women's groups. About 3,000 people were in attendance, according to Officer <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Park Police. `` Let us rededicate ourselves to the sanctity, to the nobility and the well-being of the American family, the base of our great society, the base and strength of our great <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said Pepper, as rally-goers cheered. The event at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s big outdoor pedestrian mall featured entertainment for the children, such as a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> lion dance and trampolines. Adults marched with union signs or set up picnics on the grass. Bills now pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would require businesses to give unpaid leave to workers with a newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill child and provide home health care for the chronically ill. The parental and medical leave legislation is opposed by many business groups, who object to federally mandated workplace benefits. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration also contends that such matters should be worked out between employers and employees, not ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Government was not created for defense alone,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip `` This administration does not understand this message, for they are out of touch with the needs of everyday working Americans.'' He told the rally that passage of the bills would signal an end to the `` long, national nightmare that has been the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years.'' `` We know that our family and our future do not belong to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the right wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. `` To compete in this economy, our kids need more than a right wing and a prayer.'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, said the rally `` celebrates the family values that are advanced and supported ... by the whole American labor movement, men and women, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters and grandparents alike.'' <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, urged people to sign petitions in support of the legislation and to vote in the fall only for lawmakers who worked for the measures. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last November approved a family and medical leave bill requiring firms with at least 50 employees to offer up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave over a two-year period to workers with a newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill child. Employees with serious medical conditions of their own would be entitled to up to 15 weeks of unpaid leave over a year's time. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership has not yet scheduled floor action on the bill. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., is sponsoring a family leave bill that would require businesses with more than 15 employees to offer up to 18 weeks of unpaid leave upon the birth, adoption or serious illness of a child The bill, which does not include medical leave for employees, is pending in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. Cost estimates by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> range from less than $ 500 million for the Dodd bill to less than $ 200 million for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure, a compromise worked out by Democrats and moderate Republicans. Business groups contend the costs would be higher.

<HEAD>Pope Tells Latin Americans to Show Self-Reliance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TRINIDAD, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 From the heights of the Andes to the tropical lowlands, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has carried a message of self-reliance and prodded Latin Americans to take the initiative in solving their deep social and political problems. From combating drug trafficking and corruption to stemming the `` brain drain,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> has argued that it is up to the people themselves to do battle. Addressing a Mass on Saturday in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> basin city of <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> insisted that `` constant, intense, honest and efficient work by everyone'' was needed to overcome poverty. `` We ca n't expect everything from outside,'' he said. The 12-day tour of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s ninth pilgrimage to a region he calls `` the continent of hope.'' Many people along his route have hoped for his help and blessings. About 20 women occupied a Roman Catholic church Saturday in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, to ask the pope to intercede for leftist rebels held in prison. The group occupied the <ORGANIZATION> Sacred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jesus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, 12 blocks from a seminary where the pope was to speak Sunday. Witnesses told reporters that police took the protesters away in vans. Police confirmed the incident but said they had no information on arrests. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was scheduled to meet there with priests, nuns and seminary students, as well as celebrate an open air Mass and close a conference of Latin American bishops, before moving on Monday to his last stop in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> estimates that half the world's Roman Catholics, who now number 860 million, will be living in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by the turn of the century. The pontiff has been greeted here by wildly enthusiastic crowds. Entire cities have turned out to see him. Schoolboys have run after his popemobile in motorcades, and schoolgirls have screamed as if he were a rock star as he entered a stadium for a youth rally. The pontiff has avoided blaming the <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for their difficulties. At a Mass Friday in tropical <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, for example, he lamented the region's `` excessive economic, technological, political and cultural dependence.'' In a social encyclical issued in March, which he often has cited here, the pope blamed many of the Third World's problems on the East-West superpower rivalry. Meeting with unemployed miners in the high Andean city of <LOCATION> Oruro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, and later addressing a Mass in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> deplored both the excesses of free-market capitalism and Marxism. But he also said in improvised remarks in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> that the key for Latin Americans in resolving East-West, left-right divisions is found `` here, in your human, social and Christian realities.'' Drug trafficking emerged as a major theme as the pope visited eastern <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, where cocaine barons ship narcotics to consumers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, while flying to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, told reporters it was unfair to punish only poor <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries for drug trading. But he challenged his audiences in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> to take on the traffickers, declaring that the rampant corruption was destroying their society. The pope insisted that an answer lay in following ethical, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> values _ not public and private immorality.

 Government troops crushed heavily armed Eritrean rebels who tried to take a strategic northern town for the second time in a week, the <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. The official agency said guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> suffered heavy casualties when they attacked <PERSON> Keren </PERSON> last Wednesday It gave no figures and did not mention government casualties. But the rebels claimed Saturday in a clandestine broadcast that they had put 4,000 soldiers `` out of action'' in a `` heavy offensive'' in the <LOCATION> Keren </LOCATION> area. It was not clear whether they were referring to the same battle. There was no way independently to confirm either of the claims. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s government rarely comments on rebel claims and both sides often exaggerate. The Ethiopian News Agency said government troops captured machine guns, rocket launchers, radio equipment, medicine, documents and large quantities of ammunition. It said a number of houses were destroyed in the battle, but that normal life had returned to the city 56 miles from <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> province. Rebels have been entrenched in hills surrounding Keren since April after a three-month offensive in which they captured several towns. Last Monday, the agency reported soldiers had repulsed another attack on <PERSON> Keren </PERSON>. It indicated the government has begun a counteroffensive promised by President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> on March 31. On that day, <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> acknoweldged the war for the first time and said his troops were involved in a `` grim struggle'' against the Eritrean rebels and the <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tigre </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s northernmost provinces, are the worst hit by a drought that threatens the lives of 7 million people, nearly half of whom are in the war zone.

<TEXT>
 Communist premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> on Saturday survived calls for his resignation from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most Westernized republics when the parliament rejected their plan to topple his government. In a 75-minute speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s national parliament, <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> denounced <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, the two most advanced of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics, for demanding a vote of no confidence in his administration The parliament then held separate closed debates in its two chambers, the Federal Chamber and the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republics </ORGANIZATION> and Provinces. Each chamber voted against even calling a vote on the Slovenian and Croatian proposals for a no-confidence motion, the <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. If <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> had been voted out of office, it would have been the first such vote against a Communist government anywhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Yugoslav television said the Federal Chamber voted 125 to 64 in a show of hands against a no-confidence motion. The vote in the other chamber was 64 to 23, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. The Federal Chamber has a total of 220 delegates, and the other chamber 88 deputies. Some deputies were apparently absent from Saturday's session, while five Federal Chamber members abstained. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has been grappling with a prolonged economic and social crisis that has recently prompted calls for a multi-party system to replace the Communists' current monopoly on power. In his speech, <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> suggested alternative political systems could eventually be debated, noting that `` our situation is so serious that we have no right to put off a debate on the true reasons which caused it and on its eradication.'' For the moment, however, he said there is `` no political alternative to Socialist self-management,'' the system of worker management bequeathed by <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> and now widely blamed for some of the nation's economic woes. Sixteen percent of the workforce is unemployed and the foreign debt exceeds $ 20 billion. Inflation touched almost 200 percent before the government slapped a six-month freeze on wages and prices last November. The freeze was to be lifted Sunday night, but the government announced Wednesday it would stay in force at least 10 more days while <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> tries to raise an emergency $ 300 million loan. That money is needed to stave off virtual bankruptcy before a new agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> takes effect. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> has worked with <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> officials for more than six months to devise a package of market-oriented reforms aimed at reducing inflation to 90 percent while rescheduling payments on $ 2 billion of debt and extending $ 1.4 billion in new loans. By backing <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>, parliament signaled that it supports the reforms. <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> said the new measures would be harsh but warned that `` even greater stagflation'' and drastic reductions in real wages lay ahead if inflation exceeds the target of 90 percent. The premier blamed `` the antiquity, lack of flexibility and inefficiency'' of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s current economic system for the crisis. He outlined the new economic reforms in general terms, saying they aimed to curb import restrictions, open up competition with the world market and strengthen the role of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in monetary policy. <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> said he agreed with his critics that <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s situation was grave but he defended his government's two years in office so far, noting that each of its acts had been approved by the national parliament and republican assemblies Several Slovenian and Croatian deputies argued against this in what <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> termed `` an occasionally very sharp and polemical debate.'' <PERSON> Joze </PERSON> <PERSON> Marolt </PERSON>, a Slovene delegate, recalled that in July 1986 <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> submitted what was then called an emergency economic package and warned that <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> stood before an abyss. `` Today, we are not just in front of the abyss, we are in it,'' <PERSON> Marolt </PERSON> said, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> dissolved the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday and announced that parliamentary elections will be held June 5 and June 12. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> made the announcement in a nationwide television address. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said he made the decision after his new premier, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, informed him `` that despite his efforts, he did not believe he could bring together a solid and stable majority that all governments need to carry out their programs well.'' <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> said Friday he had sought support from centrists in the 577-seat Assembly for his government and received a negative response. In his three-minute address, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> deplored the fact that `` the opening -LRB- to the center -RRB- that I sought could not be brought about to the extent that I wished. Therefore, it was my duty to draw the appropriate conclusions. A few seconds ago I signed a decree dissolving the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said the two-round election would be held on the first and second Sundays of June. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was re-elected to a second term May 8 and appointed <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> his premier after conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who had run against <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> for president, resigned. According to an opinion poll to be published Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche, 47 percent of the French favored dissolution of the Assembly, while 28 percent opposed dissolution. The poll indicated that the Socialists, the largest party in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, would get 41 percent of the vote, 24 percent would go to the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic, and 15 percent would go to the center-right Union for French Democracy. The rest of the vote would go to minor parties on the left and the right, the poll indicated. Nearly 20 percent of those polled said they would not vote. Former President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing, a prominent center-right leader, told <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> earlier he should convene the Assembly before deciding on dissolution. <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> said in a letter to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> the action should come `` after a serious discussion on what is possible and what is not.'' He said he opposed dissolution for two reasons. `` The French now will have to vote five times in 15 months'' in various elections, which <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> described as `` great waste of time and energy.'' He also said that the central problem facing the country was how to get the left and the right to work together. `` How can we achieve this if the first decision, before any attempt to work together, is to send the two camps face to face against each other in every electoral district in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> acted six days after winning a second-seven year term with 54 percent of the vote. He also dissolved the Assembly after winning his first term in 1981 and was rewarded with a victory by the Socialists in the legislative elections that followed. The last dissolution before that was pronounced by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> on May 30, 1968 after the student uprising in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>.

 Scientists, educators and other intellectuals Saturday formed communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s first new trade union in 40 years. It was not known whether the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> would be independent of the government-approved union structure, said a participant who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` You certainly can not compare the -LRB- union -RRB- with the Polish trade union Solidarity, because it is a non-political organization,'' he said. Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first independent union federation, was banned in 1981. The participant said about 400 people attended the founding session and elected a 59-member steering committee. The meeting was to take place at the <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budapest </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Eoetvoes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lorand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, but it had to be shifted to the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a cultural club, because the university rector withdrew an earlier permit granted by the dean. The new union includes representatives of natural, social and technical sciences, higher education and research institutes. Other members include laboratory assistants and unemployed researchers. interests were ignored by the official public employees' union. Spokesmen said it would fight to improve members' working conditions, increase funds for research and reduce layoffs. `` They intend to campaign for a science policy that consistently upholds their common interests and for eliminating restrictions hindering science and education,'' government radio said. Participants at the meeting voted to maintain contact with the official <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>. Steering committee member <PERSON> Csaba </PERSON> <PERSON> Oeri </PERSON> said the union `` is part of the existing Hungarian trade union movement.''

In a book titled `` Sea Power of the State,'' <PERSON> Gorshkov </PERSON> said the Soviet navy's development of a fleet of submarines and missile-launching warships had frustrated `` illusory hopes of imperialist aggressors that in the sphere of armed conflict at sea they would have no strong opponent.'' He also argued that nuclear modernization was as important as the initial acquisition of nuclear weapons to end the `` unreachability of the American continent.''

 The government said Saturday it has threatened to pull out of peace talks with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> unless the Angolans' <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> allies halt a military advance in the war zone. South African officials also said <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> should close training camps of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla group fighting white-minority rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. South African and Angolan officials met Friday in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, and discussed how to resolve <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s 13-year civil war and end South African rule over <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Both sides said the talks produced progress and would lead to further meetings soon involving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. All four countries participated in the initial round of talks May 3-4 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which adheres closely to government positions, said that before the talks can resume, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> `` will have to give assurances that the present southward advance of the Cuban forces in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> will be halted.'' It said Angolan negotiators were told that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` was fully informed about the Cuban advance, which apparently was under the direct command of President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>.'' An estimated 40,000 Cuban troops are in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> supporting the Marxist government against the pro-Western Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and its South African allies. Most of the fighting is in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The South African Press Association quoted South African officials as saying the South African delegates `` feared a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> ploy to have a last hard strike in order to make their subsequent withdrawal diplomatically more palatable.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Pik </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who led the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> delegation, `` apparently stressed that if this was the intention ... <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> would pay a heavy price and the Cubans would be severely punished,'' the press association reported.

 A bomb Saturday ripped through a truck parked near reviewing stands to be used for ceremonies marking the withdrawal of Soviet troops. Eleven Afghans, including a baby, were killed. Residents said three rockets later hit a village on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, killing four people and wounding four others. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> put the death toll at three. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, blamed both attacks on Afghan guerrillas and said one of those responsible for the 5:45 a.m. truck attack was arrested. <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevruk </PERSON> reported that 11 people were killed and 12 injured in the explosion. The blast killed a baby and an 11-year-old girl, and all the casualties were Afghan civilians, according to a Western photographer on the scene. Most appeared to have been occupants of nearby homes destroyed by the impact of the explosion, he said. `` When the bomb exploded some of the houses nearby just collapsed,'' said the photographer. The blast was so great that it shattered the windows of a bus depot across the river, 300 yards away and left a crater 20 feet wide and 10 feet deep. Soviet troops arrived afterward, the photographer said by telephone. The blast demolished embankment walls on both sides of the river that threads through this ancient capital. Blood was visible on the gates of a nearby factory and personal belongings, including carpet slippers, were scattered in the street. The bomb had been planted in a large truck that lay badly mangled at the scene. Last month, six people were killed and 49 wounded in another bomb blast along the river on the 10th anniversary of the April 1978 revolution that brought a Marxist government to power in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and triggered widespread insurrection. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the rockets Saturday hit the village of <LOCATION> Chamane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baraqi </LOCATION>, killing an old man and two children. Residents said one rocket hit a hut, killing two children inside and that an elderly man and another child were killed by debris. The village is located about a half-mile from the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. At a news conference for foreign journalists who gathered for the beginning of the Soviet withdrawal, <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said his government will survive because it offers peace. He added that he will address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Special Session on Disarmament in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next month and planned trips to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` We can state confidently that we will last because we strive and struggle for peace,'' he said. `` Our opponents offer the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> people war, and the people hate this.'' Also at a news conference Saturday, the head of the Soviet military contingent in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said the anti-Communist rebels were taking their toll on the Soviet and Afghan troops but that rebel attacks will not deter the withdrawal, which begins Sunday. `` The opposition may have some effect on us, but not much, and certainly they will not be able to frustrate the timetable,'' Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> told reporters. `` We have the means at our disposal to fulfill the timetable.'' The comments by <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and the report of the rocket attack were carried in a <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency pool report from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The Associated Press was excluded from the pool because of questions it asked Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> last month. Under an accord signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on April 14, the Soviets will complete their withdrawal within nine months. Half of the Soviets must be out by Aug. 15, according to the peace agreement. Soviet soldiers entered the war in December 1979 to help the allied government fight off the insurgents, and about 115,000 remain here to back forces loyal to President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>.

 The government said Saturday it has threatened to pull out of peace talks with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> unless the Angolans' <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> allies halt a military advance in the war zone. South African officials also said <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> should close training camps of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla group fighting white-minority rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. South African and Angolan officials met Friday in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, and discussed how to resolve <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s 13-year civil war and end South African rule over <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Both sides said the talks produced progress and would lead to further meetings soon involving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. All four countries participated in the initial round of talks May 3-4 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which adheres closely to government positions, said that before the talks can resume, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> `` will have to give assurances that the present southward advance of the Cuban forces in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> will be halted.'' It said Angolan negotiators were told that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` was fully informed about the Cuban advance, which apparently was under the direct command of President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>.'' An estimated 40,000 Cuban troops are in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> supporting the Marxist government against the pro-Western Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and its South African allies. Most of the fighting is in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The South African Press Association quoted South African officials as saying the South African delegates `` feared a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> ploy to have a last hard strike in order to make their subsequent withdrawal diplomatically more palatable.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Pik </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who led the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> delegation, `` apparently stressed that if this was the intention ... <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> would pay a heavy price and the Cubans would be severely punished,'' the press association reported. In <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, the independent weekly Expresso Saturday quoted unidentified sources as saying 8,600 Cuban soldiers landed in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by plane and ship in a two-week period at the end of April and the beginning of May. The report said the reinforcements included 2,000 elite Cuban soldiers known as rangers, a force that previously has not sent troops to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and 200 helicopter pilots. Expresso said the Cubans landed in the Angolan capital, <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, and five other towns without the knowledge or approval of Angolan authorities, including President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Sharansky Recalls Joke On KGB In New Book</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet dissident <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> recalls in a new book how he forced <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents out of his building and into the cold in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1974 by threatening to call the police. It is one of the lighter moments in <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s book, `` Fear No Evil,'' excerpted in the May 23 issue of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> News & amp; World Report. In the years before his arrest in 1977 on suspicion of passing secrets to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was a prominent dissident who had been repeatedly refused permission to emigrate from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He was often followed by the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> and says he sometimes found them a source of amusement. He says `` the most fun'' he had at the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>'s expense was on Nov. 7, 1974, a Soviet holiday, when <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> had been assigned to work at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> and Gas to take care of emergencies. `` Three tails followed me to work, but because no outsiders were allowed in our building, they had to remain in the car. A little later, the security guard called from downstairs to report that a group of men had come into the lobby to warm up,'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> said. He called the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, identified himself and said he was in charge of the building that day. `` Downstairs in the lobby are three <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> men who are following citizen <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> ... did you give them permission to enter?'' There was a long pause, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> said, and the voice asked his identity. `` <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>,'' he replied. `` You're making fun of us. It's only noon and you're already drunk!'' the voice said, and hung up. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> said he called the building security guard and ordered him to tell the three men he had spoken to their boss who did n't approve of their being in the building `` If they do n't leave ... I'll notify the police,'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> said. He said he walked to the window later and saw they were back in the car. `` I always treasured that moment, that wonderful feeling of having the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> obey me,'' he writes. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was convicted by a Soviet court in 1978 of being a spy. He was freed in February 1986 in an East-West prisoner exchange and joined his wife in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The magazine is scheduled to publish additional excerpts in next week's issue, in which <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> details his 90 months in Soviet prisons and a labor camp.

<HEAD>Thieves Steal Shrubs from Charleston Gardens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Residents are blaming a different kind of garden grub for nipping their spring in the bud. Devious defoliators have been stalking the gardens of this city by night to steal shrubs and trees. `` It's just so awful,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeufele </PERSON>, who had five rhododendrons stolen from her yard on Mother's Day. `` I waited four years to get them. You could just croak.'' `` A person has to be pretty low to steal someone's shrubbery,'' said a residential developer who lost 10 freshly planted dogwood trees. The trees, worth $ 150 each, were uprooted on May 2 from a neighborhood dotted with homes worth about $ 300,000 to $ 500,000. Burglars also snatched six shrubs from the city's posh <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> district on April 21, police said. In <LOCATION> Spencer </LOCATION>, about 35 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, police arrested a man late last month who allegedly held an elderly man at gunpoint while two others stole a month-old $ 385 garden tiller. State Police Cpl. <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strobbe </PERSON> said the tiller was taken to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and sold. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> residents who have had their plants pilfered believe they are being sold on the green market also. <PERSON> Audra </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeufeles </PERSON>' neighbor, said her 2-year-old rhododendron was preparing to bloom when it was stolen on Mother's Day `` I never heard of them just walking into the yard and digging up a plant,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. `` I know several other people down the street lost shrubs, too.'' The wave of thefts has surprised residents in some of the city's finer areas, where crime is relatively rare, but police say there is not much they can do `` It's a crime of opportunity,'' said Sgt. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Staples </LOCATION>, adding that plant larcenies crop up every spring. `` It's kind of hard to do anything,'' <PERSON> Staples </PERSON> said. `` Where do you begin? How do you put identification on a plant?''

 Relatives and friends of the 37 sailors who died when the USS Stark was hit by two missiles in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> will gather here on the first anniversary of the attack to remember their fallen loved ones. A ceremony is scheduled for Tuesday at the Stark Memorial, located on the dock where the Stark departed in February 1987 for the routine deployment, and where the burned-out guided missile frigate returned six months later to a subdued heroes' welcome. More than 140 relatives and friends of those lost in the attack are expected to attend the service. `` Our chapel keeps them regularly in our prayers and they are a regular part of our prayer life,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Chaplain <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, who will conduct the ceremonies. `` We still hold these families in our prayers and thoughts.'' This <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> community was shattered last May 17 when two missiles fired by an Iraqi warplane slammed into the Stark. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said later the attack was an accident. The reason for gathering on the first anniversary is written right on the memorial, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. `` You will not be forgotten!'', it reads. `` That's the whole reason for getting together on the 17th,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. Following a dockside ceremony, family members will board a sister ship of the Stark for a wreath-laying ceremony in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The USS Stark itself is still undergoing repairs in a <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, shipyard.

 The luxury yacht Monkey Business, which ferried former presidential candidate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> with model <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, was seized Saturday when <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers found marijuana on it, officials said. `` They found one gram of marijuana, that's one-twenty-eighth of an ounce. According to ` Zero Tolerance,' if we find enough to test positive it's enough to seize the vesssel,'' said Petty Officer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogeley </PERSON>. The 82-foot yacht was boarded during a routine safety check about 22 miles northwest of the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Bimini </LOCATION>, and a member of the boarding party spotted rolling papers used to make marijuana cigarettes. `` We consider that probable cause,'' said <PERSON> Vogely </PERSON>. A search uncovered a single joint of marijuana in the pocket of a jacket hanging in a closet; the cutter <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shoalwater </LOCATION> then escorted the yacht to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> base here. During a dockside search, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McCauley </PERSON> said his men found an additional 8 grams of marijuana in another garment hanging in a closet. The four people on board, whose names were not released, have not been arrested because the marijuana has not been linked to anybody, <PERSON> Vogeley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vogeley </PERSON> said the yacht, worth at least $ 1 million, is currently registered to <LOCATION> Turnberry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION>, and the four crewmembers were wearing <LOCATION> Turnberry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> t-shirts. When <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, his friend <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadhurst </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and her friend <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Armandt </PERSON> took their trip in March 1987 to <LOCATION> Bimini </LOCATION>, about 55 miles east of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the chartered yacht was owned by millionaire developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Soffer </PERSON> and kept at <LOCATION> Turnberry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Soffer </PERSON> has an unlisted number; a woman who answered the phone at <ORGANIZATION> Turnberry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isle </ORGANIZATION> said the club would have no comment. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> withdrew from the race for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination on May 8, 1987, only weeks after he had announced his candidacy, when The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> revealed his liaison with Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who also had Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> as a weekend guest at his home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, maintained that the relationship and the trip to <LOCATION> Bimini </LOCATION> were innocent. He eventually re-entered the race, but did not do well and finally withdrew again. The multidecked, aluminum-hulled motor yacht with a hot tub and a bar adorned with an Oriental rug has a flashy history beyond presidential politics. Celebrities who have visited the Monkey Business' rosewood-paneled staterooms include <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Caan </PERSON> Zero Tolerance is the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's new get-tough policy under which any drug conveyance can be confiscated and may be auctioned off after a hearing. The quantity of drugs does not matter. For example, the $ 2.5 million, 133-foot Ark Royal was confiscated off Key West on May 7 when less than a teaspoon of marijuana was found aboard. The yacht was returned last week after <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON>, president of the California-based company that owns the boat, paid a $ 1,600 fine. The Zero Tolerance policy was announced in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> two weeks ago by <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON>. It has been in effect since April 11.

 <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> was the center of attention Saturday at the <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, where a film directed by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON> told the story of her 1974 kidnapping by an urban terrorist group. `` I've not completely lost the feeling of anger and I doubt if I ever will,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` But I do n't carry this through my whole life. The film `` Patty Hearst'' recounts how the granddaughter of newspaper magnate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> was kidnapped by the <ORGANIZATION> Symbionese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. She was blindfolded, held prisoner in a cupboard for 57 days and subjected to revolutionary re-education. Renamed <PERSON> Tania </PERSON>, she took part in an armed bank robbery and stayed with the <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> for 18 months before the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> arrested her in 1975. The film covers the five years from the kidnapping to February 1979, when President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> granted her a pardon from her seven-year prison sentence. Ms. <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> said she felt no personal responsibility for the criminal act she committed. `` Nothing would have happened if the kidnapping had not taken place,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> said she had read the screenplay that was based on her own account of the affair, `` My Voyage in Hell,'' published in 1978. She said she been asked for her comments while the film was being made, but she stayed away from the production `` because it may have been uncomfortable for personal reasons.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> was pleased with the film when she saw it. `` I was afraid it would be sex, guns and rock' n roll but it was n't,'' she said. <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON>, who also has directed `` Hardcore'' and `` American Gigolo,'' said he saw the events from Ms. <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>'s point of view. `` The film portrays the visions and sentiments of <PERSON> Patty </PERSON>,'' he said. `` It was never intended to be a sociological film or a comment on the times, but rather the view of a 19-year-old girl who had led a sheltered life.'' Her character was played by British actress <PERSON> Natasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, the daughter of actress <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>. `` Miss <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> was never acting of her own volition.

<HEAD>Major Railroads Sue Minnesota Over New Occupied Caboose Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten major railroads are suing <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to challenge a new state law requiring an occupied caboose on freight trains of a certain length carrying hazardous materials. The suit, filed Friday in federal court, contends that the law, which goes into effect Aug. 1, is pre-empted by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> regulations that allow freight trains to operate in interstate commerce without occupied cabooses. The railroads also say federal law governing the efficient interstate transportation of hazardous materials pre-empts the caboose law. They say the new law discriminates against interstate transportation because it exempts certain local runs carrying such commodities as grain. Among the railroads seeking to have the federal court void the state law are <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION>, the Soo Line, <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Missabe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Iron Range Railway. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s new law states that trains more than 2,000 feet long that have cars marked as carrying hazardous materials must have a caboose at the end of the train and it must be occupied by at least one train crew member. Violations of the law would permit the state attorney general's office or a county sheriff to seek a civil penalty against the offending railroad The stated purpose of the law, which was pushed by railroad labor unions, was to promote rail safety by helping to spot equipment failure or problems with track beds. But opponents said it was merely an attempt by the railroad unions to preserve jobs no longer needed. `` A caboose is just no longer needed,'' <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiegold </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday. He said there are computerized trackside monitors that indicate problems. Money also is a factor in dropping the caboose, <PERSON> Wiegold </PERSON> said. `` It's costly to keep those cabooses on there.''

<TEXT>
 Thousands of tank-led Syrian troops rolled down from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s central mountains Saturday and prepared to enter the slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where Western hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian extremists. By nightfall more than 4,000 soldiers and 250 tanks and armored personnel carriers were deployed at the edge of the 16-square-mile slum area, buttressing 7,500 Syrian troops already in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, military sources said. `` The buildup is expected to be completed sometime Sunday, perhaps at daybreak or a little later, after which the forces will move in,'' one source said on condition of anonymity. The guns fell silent in the embattled slums when the Syrians arrived, police said. The move followed the conquest of the slums by fundamentalist fighters of the Iranian-allied <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, in nine days of savage fighting with the pro-Syrian Amal Shiite Moslem militia. Police said 211 people were killed. Police estimate <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has 3,000 combatants fighting Amal, which has thrown about 6,500 militiamen into the battle. The vanguard of the incoming Syrian forces Saturday rumbled across south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Ouzai coastal highway at 5 p.m. in 48 T-55 Soviet-made tanks with gunners atop their swinging turrets. They were led by Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intelligence chief in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Beirakdar </PERSON>, commander in chief of the Syrian forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They headed the battalion in a chauffeured, bulletproof, dark blue Mercedes. Truckloads of infantrymen and ammunition and jeeps mounted with 106mm recoilless guns streamed in afterwards. Hundreds of plainclothes Syrian secret servicemen at all gateways to the slums blocked reporters and photographers from entering. <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beirakdar </PERSON>, flanked by senior aides, met for an hour with <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s chieftain <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, who is also <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s justice minister, at his heavily fortified house in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Saturday night. `` They have agreed that the Syrians will go into the slums but not into the nearby <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> refugee camps'' where rival factions also have been fighting, a <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> spokesman said later on condition of anonymity. A high-ranking Lebanese military source, also speaking privately, said the Syrian reinforcements were `` going to move in peacefully under an agreement being worked out by the presidents of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.'' The reinforcements were coming from the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> maintains the bulk of 25,000 troops stationed in eastern and northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the source said. The move came on the heels of a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> threat of `` immediate and drastic treatment'' after <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s forces stormed through the last Amal stronghold. `` After advancing across half of <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> now controls 90 percent of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' reported a police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Police said 20 people were killed and 41 injured Saturday in the house-to-house inter-Shiite Moslem combat and other factional clashes in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The latest casualties raised the toll in area fighting to 211 killed and 586 wounded since May 6. The thud of exploding shells echoed across west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militiamen advanced across <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> fighters withdrew toward Syrian lines in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. As <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> dueled in <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION>, rival <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla factions battled with howitzers and mortars for control of the nearby <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> el-Barajneh refugee camp. At the refugee shantytown, seven people were killed and 16 wounded in clashes that broke out early Saturday between guerrillas of <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction and Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s Syrian-backed Fatah-Uprising, police said. The south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> slums are where most of the 18 foreign hostages, including nine Americans, are believed held by kidnappers affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. The Beirut-based magazine <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> said Friday the hostages had been moved from an exposed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> barracks to the home of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> to prevent their liberation. Ash-Shiraa broke the story of secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in November 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Saturday it had also occupied <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s military headquarters on the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport highway in a fierce overnight assault. Helmeted Syrian troops manned checkpoints along all roads connecting south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with the city's western sector, police said. The Syrian move was aimed at preventing the <ORGANIZATION> Amal-Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> confrontation from spreading to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s sphere of influence in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, they said. South <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> remains outside the jurisdiction of the Syrian contingent that deployed in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in February 1987 after a month of bloody clashes between Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Druse </ORGANIZATION> warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, maintains 25,000 troops in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> and in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Syrian troops Friday shot and killed five <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters who tried to cross into the Syrian-policed Ouzai seaside district. It was the first clash between the two groups in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Attracted by the slogan, `` We'll provide the diamond if you provide the bride,'' 13 couples married Saturday at home plate before a minor league baseball game. The couples came from neighboring <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to avoid the expense or bother of an AIDS test, which has been mandatory in their home state since Jan. 1. Players from the <ORGANIZATION> Kenosha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Twins </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Expos </ORGANIZATION> lined paths at <LOCATION> Simmons </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> that led the brides and grooms to a portable chapel at home plate. `` This is to be entered into seriously, honorably, advisably and, in this case, with good sportsmanship,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kenosha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said to open the ceremony. Some brides wore traditional wedding gowns while others were dressed in more casual attire. One groom wore a black top hat and tuxedo, and next to him stood another prospective husband wearing an open collar shirt and slacks. `` We did not want to spend $ 200 or $ 300 to get a marriage license,'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said after she married <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Richton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` We looked at <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> before, and then this came up, and it was just perfect,'' she said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s bridesmaid, <PERSON> Gwendlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, said the ceremony was perfect for non-traditional and `` economic minded couples.'' <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> charges $ 50 for a wedding license but does not require any test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> charges $ 15 for a license, but it also requires a blood test for AIDS and syphilis, which can cost between $ 20 and $ 120 a person, depending on the laboratory. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Kenosha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Twins </ORGANIZATION>, said he thought of the mass wedding after watching county clerk <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Principe </PERSON> discuss on a news show the sudden rush of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> couples applying for <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> marriage licenses. `` If you look at baseball, it's a tradition. And marriage, well it's a tradition also, so it makes sense to have it here,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure these wedding couples will remember this for a long time to come.'' <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harter </PERSON>, an infielder for the <ORGANIZATION> Twins </ORGANIZATION>, said the ceremony was enjoyable, `` but I think we're all wondering who would get married on a baseball diamond. Maybe the real question is n't whether ` I do,' but ` Why here?''' Team officials said 14 couples registered for the wedding, and all but one showed up. The missing couple was from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The couples ranged in age from early 20s to late 50s. <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, 47, and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, 56, both of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said the wedding ceremony was the first time they had ever been on a baseball field.

 Ousted Arizona Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was elected Saturday as a GOP national delegate as the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> held its first convention since his removal from office. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> won on his second attempt to win a seat to the party's national convention, trying first without success to be picked from his own congressional district and then as a delegate at large He was not claimed by any presidential candidate. His stormy, 15-month governorship tore the state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, and former Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, in a keynote address greeted by several standing ovations, urged Republicans to try to `` heal the wounds.'' `` If we keep picking away at each other ... the state's going to become a one-party state again,'' <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> added. He urged members to settle their differences at election time and `` let bygones be bygones or at least be patient and wait until election time to make corrections that you feel may be needed.'' `` I have done very little work,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said when asked to assess his chances before the balloting. `` If I win, it'll be because people decide I should go. It's not a big thing.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was removed as governor by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> court of impeachment last month, is facing criminal charges in <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> next Thursday. The thought of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> going to the Republican National Convention as one of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s 33 delegates drew open disdain from other politicians in the state. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., had said he would be `` inclined not to attend'' the national convention if <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> were a delegate On Saturday, however, <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said he was certain he would attend whether or not <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was a delegate. `` I am sure we will want to do that. I never changed my mind. I said that I was thinking long and hard about it _ I never said that I was n't going,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has won enough delegates nationwide to be clinch the nomination in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and was expected to control the state convention as well after receiving majorities in 24 of 37 pre-convention caucuses and tying with former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in one. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, one of the 717 delegates to Saturday's convention, said before the voting started that he believed he had `` strong support'' from rank-and-file party workers. He said Saturday he would support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and would concentrate on who <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate would be. Officials of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> campaigns said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> would not be on their list of recommended delegates, but <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign said its recommended slate would stop at 32 to enable <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> backers to fill in his name as the 33rd delegate if they wished <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who faces criminal trial next Thursday on charges he failed to report properly a $ 350,000 campaign loan, was removed from office last month after the Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him in a civil proceeding of misusing state money and obstructing an investigation into allegations that a campaign aide threatened the life of a former aide.

<HEAD>Laos Waiting For Aid Before Continuing MIA Search
^By DENIS D. GRAY
^Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should give <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> humanitarian aid if it wants the country to account for Americans missing in the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war, a senior government official said Saturday. `` We have fulfilled our obligation with the excavation,'' said Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Soubanh </PERSON> <PERSON> Srithirath </PERSON>. `` We are awaiting the humanitarian gesture from the U.S.A.'' Soubanh was referring to a joint excavation in southern <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> province for the remnants of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft shot down in 1966 with two crewmen aboard. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Laotian soldiers completed the dig Wednesday but found no remains. Soubanh spoke in an interview with a group of Western reporters taken on a rare tour of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, a largely isolated nation ruled by a communist government since December 1975. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to account for 555 Americans missing in action in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, many of them airmen downed during missions against Laotian and Vietnamese communist positions. Under an agreement in August last year, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> ended a long period of inactivity on the MIA issue while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it will consider <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>'s calls for humanitarian aid. That was virtually identical to an agreement with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' close ally where nearly 1,800 Americans are reported missing Vietnamese officials recently have been demanding that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> honor its pledge of humanitarian assistance. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has given <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> some food aid in recent years. After the <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> dig, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team donated medicine and equipment worth about $ 13,000 to a local hospital as an expression of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s concern, said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Soubanh </PERSON> suggested the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> give more medical aid, including construction of a hospital in <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION>. In another development, <PERSON> Soubanh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has withdrawn a significant number of its troops from <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, where he says they have been helping with national security and economic development for more than a decade. <PERSON> Soubanh </PERSON> declined to give numbers but said the pullout began in mid-1987. The troops returned home because <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have improved and the Laotian government's own military forces were adequate, he said. `` We feel that our security is less threatened,'' he said. Some Western diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> speculate that less than half the estimated 50,000 Vietnamese troops have left. Others say they believe more than 40,000 have pulled out. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> formally stations troops in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> under a 25-year friendship treaty signed in 1977. But most Western sources believe some of the Vietnamese forces that helped the Laotian communists battle the U.S.-backed regime in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> remained in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> after the communists took power in 1975.

<HEAD>Jackson Calls for Ocean Sanctuary to Stop Oil Drilling off

<DATELINE>MENDOCINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pledged Saturday that if elected president he would `` end for all times'' plans for exploratory offshore oil drilling along <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s picturesque <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` This plan to drill for oil, pollute the ocean, and dirty the air is environmental violence, it's economic violence,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, using a solar-powered sound system to address the crowd. Despite polls showing him far behind <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> drew large and enthusiastic crowds as he crossed <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> campaigning for the last and biggest Democratic presidential primary on June 7. There are 336 delegates at stake. Acknowledging the long odds against his campaign, in which he trails <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 655 delegates with just 512 still to be elected, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the cheering crowd: `` Why do I run against these odds? I've faced odds all my life ... we can not surrender, we the people can win, we really can win.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> attacked the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a wide range of issues, but his focus Saturday was on environmental and educational concerns. He received his most enthusiastic response to a pledge to support a congressional proposal to create a permanent ocean sanctuary that effectively would forever bar oil drilling off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. In particular <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> promised his opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Lease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 91 </ORGANIZATION>, a proposal by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> providing for oil drilling. Standing beneath a clear sky on a bluff overlooking the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> at one of the most scenic spots on the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast 150 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the oil drilling plans for that region amount to a `` drain <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy at any environmental price. `` A <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> administration will end for all times Lease Sale 91. There will be no drilling for oil on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> -LRB- of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> -RRB- under a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> presidency,'' he told a rally of more than 1,500 at the remote, sparsely populated resort area. Later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> repeated familiar themes supporting education and providing equal opportunities for minorities at a rally of several thousand supporters at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` You will make the world better. You will make the world better. You are the hope,'' he told the crowd. Before about 5,000 supporters at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> repeated his proposal to freeze defense spending at current levels and use that money for housing, health care, student aid and other social needs. `` Our future is in co-existence, not co-annihilation. Enough of this false security'' from building more weapons, he said. `` Let's go another way, let's invest in people, let's use some of that money to keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong and make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> better.

<HEAD>Former Pilot Defector Seeks Bigger Gold Reward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> air force pilot who defected to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in a jet bomber in 1965 said Saturday the government should have given him a bigger gold reward. In a petition to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yuan </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s highest lawmaking body, Col. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsien-pin </PERSON> said he was living in hardship and asked the government to give him the shares of the gold rewards that were given to two technicians who flew to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. Technicians <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai-wang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lien </PERSON> <PERSON> Pao-sheng </PERSON> did not deserve any share of the reward of 330 pounds of gold, Col. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said, claiming the two technicians were merely his captives. The reward was paid in cash and Col. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> received about $ 70,000, or 50 percent of the reward, while <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai-wang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lien </PERSON> split the other half. The government said the reward for <PERSON> Lien </PERSON>, who died of severe injuries when the Ilyushin-28 bomber crash-landed at <LOCATION> Taoyuan </LOCATION> air base in northern <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, would be handed to <PERSON> Lien </PERSON>'s relatives in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> when the Nationalists regain the Chinese mainland. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai-wang </PERSON> went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after he retired from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s air force in 1975. Vice Defense Minister <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsueh-tsun </PERSON> on Saturday told lawmakers the rewards also went to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai-wang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lien </PERSON> because they helped <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsien-pin </PERSON> in flying to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> also argued the government has taken good care of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> says owns three houses and earns a monthly salary of $ 1,700. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has a sliding scale of rewards paid in gold for defecting Chinese servicemen that depends on the type of military aircraft or ships brought out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. A jet bomber is worth 330 pounds of gold. Officials say 13 military personnel have defected from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> since 1949, when the Nationalists fled to this island after losing a civil war to the Communists on the Chinese mainland.

 Voters here may become the first in the nation to shut down an operating nuclear power plant when they consider rival ballot measures to decide the fate of the problem-plagued Rancho Seco plant. A measure sponsored by a group called SAFE, or Sacramentans for Safe Energy, would order the permanent closure of the 14-year-old plant, one of the few publicly owned nuclear power plants in the country. An alternative plan put on the June 7 ballot by the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION>, in effect asks the district's voters to give the the plant 25 miles southeast of here another chance. The utility district, which comprises <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and surrounding areas with a combined population of more than 420,000, has struggled with operating problems at the plant for years. In addition, district consumers have struggled with electricity rates that have gone up nearly 85 percent in three years, and critics blame <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> for that, too. `` The thing has such a history of running so poorly and being unsafe that no one would believe it wo n't do the same thing in the future,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulholland </PERSON>, political director of <LOCATION> Campaign </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, an environmental and consumer's group working on the shutdown effort. `` We figure that the odds of Rancho Seco operating above the industry average are about the same as winning the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lottery,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ory </PERSON> of Campaign <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Rancho Seco managers say the plant deserves another chance. `` We're champing at the bit to show the public we can do it,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Redeker </PERSON>, deputy operations manager. `` For the first time, we have an attitude of do it right.'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeloff </PERSON>, the only one of the five utility district board members who wants to shut down <ORGANIZATION> Rancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seco </ORGANIZATION>, said passage of the measure could indirectly influence the private utilities that own the vast majority of the nation's nuclear plants. Even though those utilities are not under the control of the voters, as the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> utility is, they are sensitive to public opinion, he said. `` It certainly does, I think, set a tone if a local electorate does n't want a nuclear plant,'' he said. `` It would worry other utilities across the country even if the electorate does n't have the final say.'' The plant, built for $ 375 million by <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Wilcox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has a reactor design like that of Three Mile Island reactor No. 2, the site of the nation's worst commercial nuclear power plant accident in March 1979. From the day of its dedication in October 1974, the plant has been plagued by malfunctioning equipment and operator errors that forced more than 100 outages, including a shutdown that lasted from December 1985 to last month. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission called the overcooling accident that led to that shutdown one of the dozen worst problems suffered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants in 1985. The agency gives the plant one of the worst efficiency ratings of any in the nation. Federal investigations have concluded that the plant had a history of mismanagement, poor or non-existent maintenance, poor operator training, inattention to detail, and failure to learn from past mistakes. A federal investigation of a 1985 overcooling accident also found that an important monitor was set at a level that would underestimate escaping radiation. Proponents of the shutdown, dubbed Measure B on the ballot, include Mayor <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudin </PERSON> and a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. They argue that the plant will never be adequate or reliable and will require an endless stream of money for scheduled modifications and unforeseen repairs. Proponents of the alternate measure, Measure C, argue that the utility has spent $ 400 million to overhaul the plant, is hiring an outside company to manage it, and deserves a chance to prove <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION>'s viability. But the proposed hiring of another manager has provoked another dispute because the company, <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, contributed $ 100,000 to the Measure C campaign. Measure C includes a provision that would call for the district to shut down Rancho Seco any time after Dec. 31 if the plant fails to operate at more than 50 percent of capacity for four consecutive months. In the past, the plant has managed to operate at an average of just 40 percent of capacity. The 50 percent requirement, however, could be overridden by four of the utility's five directors. Opponents of the plant question how legally binding Measure C would be. `` It's my legal opinion that Measure C in no way restricts the board from doing anything they want,'' said attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Remy </PERSON>, SAFE chairman. Whatever voters decide on June 7, the issue will almost certainly end up in court, <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> has named a new Cabinet, including a retired admiral as interior minister, the government's official gazette reported Saturday The 15-member Cabinet resigned en masse a week ago after strident criticism from opposition parties that accused <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and his ministers of failing to halt <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s economic decline or control guerrilla violence. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who announced the appointments late Friday, named retired Adm. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Soria </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, who has served as president of the joint military command, as interior minister, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronica </PERSON> reported. He replaced <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Barsallo </PERSON>. The government's fight against leftist guerrillas, whose eight-year insurgency has cost more than 10,000 lives, is directed by the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s naming of <PERSON> Soria </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> was viewed by analysts as a sign the government will implement tougher anti-insurgency policies. Sen. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON>, 72, a long-time leader of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was named prime minister, replacing <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Larco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> named eight new ministers, while the seven others were renamed to their posts, the government daily said. It was the second Cabinet shakeup since <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> took office in July 1985. In other key changes, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, former ambassador to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was named to head the foreign ministry, while <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> was tabbed finance minister, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronica </PERSON> said. Other appointments were: <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arteaga </PERSON> as industry minister; <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Alegria </PERSON> as fishing minister; <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinillos </PERSON> as health minister and retired Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> as transportation minister, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronica </PERSON> said. The full Cabinet also resigned a year ago, following an internal party dispute between <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and then Prime Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. Most minister at that time were renamed to Cabinet slots.

 <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> laid claim Saturday to the breakfast crown of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> after serving pancakes to more than 31,000 people at a table that stretched seven blocks down Main Street. The event was part of this western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> city's 352nd birthday celebration and continued a 12-year contest with <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, which touts itself as the cereal capital of the world. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> said a total of breakfast guests reached 31,279, exceeding by more than 800 the number served at <ORGANIZATION> Battle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION>'s annual breakfast last summer. `` We had a perfect day for a perfect event,'' <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> said. `` The first -LRB- pancake -RRB- hit the grill at 7:25 -LRB- a.m. EDT -RRB- and they did n't stop serving until 11:45. City workers and residents pitched in for kitchen detail and area businesses donated most of the food, she said. The recipe for 64,000 pancakes: 3,000 pounds of flour, 660 pounds of egg yolk, 225 pounds of butter and 400 gallons of water. The pancakes were topped with a ton of butter and 200 gallons of maple syrup and served with 600 gallons of coffee and 600 gallons of orange juice. A radio station dished out blueberries for topping. The theme went beyond food. About 100 volunteers unfurled an 85-by-45-foot American Flag that flew over Mt. <PERSON> Rushmore </PERSON> for the landmark's 50th anniversary. The flag was mounted on top of a crane in front of city hall. The `` Breakfast Bowl'' was launched in 1956 to mark the 50th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> when that city set a world record for the longest breakfast table. In 1976, <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> bested <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> for the longest table with a pancake breakfast as part of its celebration of the nation's bicentennial But the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> city quickly regained the crown and continues to hold it, with the exception of brief interruptions by <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> in 1986 and 1987. Last May, <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> fed 27,067 people at a 3,600-foot table, confident that <ORGANIZATION> Battle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> could n't do better because its Main Street is n't long enough. But one month later, <ORGANIZATION> Battle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> bent a 3,700-foot-long table for 30,413 around a street corner to reclaim the title. This year, former <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> gave up on table length and focused on numbers served. The strategy worked, although this year's table stretched a mere 2,000 feet. <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> may not hold the title for long _ <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> has its annual cereal breakfast June 4.

 Members of the Japanese terrorist group <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> demanded that authorities release a co-member arrested recently or face a `` fitting reprisal,'' a newspaper reported in its Sunday editions. In a telex dispatched Saturday from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to the newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, the group said <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON>, an alleged <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> faction member, went to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` to pioneer the way for us to return.'' Unless the Japanese government and police took immediate action to release <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was prepared to retaliate, faction members said in a message titled, `` An Urgent Statement on the Unfair Arrest of Comrade <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON>.'' In the telex sent to the newspaper's <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> headquarters, the group also claimed Japanese authorities were `` repressing'' groups in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> sympathetic to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> cause and demanded that such action be stopped on threat of reprisal, <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> reported in both its Japanese and English-language editions. On May 6 police arrested <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON>, 34, near his apartment. He is one of nine alleged <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> terrorists suspected of taking part in the 1970 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> passenger jet to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. At the time of his arrest, <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> was carrying a passport issued in the name of <PERSON> Akira </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakao </PERSON>, a Japanese who had assumed North Korean citizenship and was residing in his adopted country. <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> also reported that in a follow-up telephone conversation with <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Morisuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakabayashi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the suspected terrorist replied in the positive when asked if seven faction members were based in that country. <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> said it contacted <PERSON> Wakabayashi </PERSON>, one of the leaders of the 1970 hijacking group, as he was dispatching the telex to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Pyongyang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wakabayashi </PERSON> denied any role by North Korean officials in planning the message. `` We conferred among ourselves and wrote a 4,000-character message at first. Then we cut it in half to 2,000,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying. The group's message said <PERSON> Shibata </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because he was homesick and discounted as slanderous Japanese reports that the faction member was planning a terrorist attack or was spying for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

 American jazz artist <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had been using heroin shortly before his fatal fall from a third-floor hotel window, police said Saturday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 58, had a history of drug abuse and died early Friday near <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s heroin district. The trumpeter, famed for his appearances with the <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quartet </PERSON> in the 1950s, had been scheduled to go on a tour of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` The way it looks, he had just been using'' heroin, police spokesman <PERSON> Klaas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilting </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Traces of heroin abuse were found in <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s hotel room, he added. `` Maybe he started acting funny ... He was alone and shoved the window open himself and either fell or jumped out ... I do n't suppose we'll ever find out which,'' Wilting added A receptionist at the <PERSON> Prins </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrik </PERSON> hotel, where <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> checked in Thursday, recounted how the musician `` was a little nervous'' when he arrived. He did not elaborate. The receptionist, who refused to give his name, added that the window of the room <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was in slides open vertically, leaving a 10-inch gap at most. `` How he got through there, I do n't know,'' the receptionist said. Born as <PERSON> Chesney </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Yale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, in December 1929, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s career got into full swing when he joined British saxophonist <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> and his quartet. Known to jazz buffs as the initiator of the `` cool school'' of jazz, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was renowned for the thin, cool tone of his trumpet playing and spent most of his time in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who appeared frequently in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, was beset by arrests and heroin problems throughout most of his later career and was sentenced to a 16-month prison term for drug offenses in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in the early 1960s.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was heckled Saturday by gay political activists over his stand on their rights to be foster parents, while Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fended off a corporate executive's criticism of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies on taxes and trade Both parties' presidential front-runners were spending the weekend campaigning in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where the the bulk of the final round of primaries will be held in the next two weeks. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, speaking to several dozen homosexual activists at a political action committee meeting in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, promised, `` You're going to be deeply involved in what we do.'' But the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was challenged over a policy in his state giving low priority to homosexual couples who want to be foster parents. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he favored the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> policy `` because I think it's best, all things being equal, for a child to grow up in a household with a mother and father and other children.'' His defense of that policy was met with some hisses from the crowd and occasional shouts of protest. One man shouted, `` bigot,'' and another yelled, `` You're anti-gay. Why do n't you admit it?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> later shrugged off the hostile reception, saying, `` It was lively. That's what democracy is all about.'' His aides, nevertheless, were pleased with the way the meeting went. `` I thought it was very good, very open,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, national political coordinator for the campaign. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured an <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> microchip plant in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, where the company's board chairman, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON>, told the vice president of a need for higher taxes and for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign the trade bill. `` I do n't think that there is any chance of a balanced budget without new taxes,'' said <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Saturday repeated his vow to veto a trade bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because of a provision requiring large companies to notify employees in advance of plant closings. `` The plant-closing aspect of the trade bill does not seem onerous to us,'' <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON> said. `` It is no less than we would do in any case.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was not swayed by <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON>'s arguments. The vice president also sought to take the high ground on the issue of the environment, saying, `` For too long we have given away the playing field to the Democrats on the environment. I want to make the environment a Republican issue.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, took the environment as his theme, saying he would seek a ban of exploratory offshore oil drilling along the state's north coast forever. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> addressed an enthusiastic crowd in <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> using a solar-powered loudspeaker. `` This plan to drill for oil, pollute the ocean, and dirty the air is environmental violence, it's economic violence,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, speaking in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, on Saturday, said he believes <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will win the Democratic presidential nomination but will need <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s help to win in November. `` A <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> who is an impassioned part of the effort to support <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> wins, and that's the way it looks, that would be helpful, absolutely,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. The next two weeks mark the close to the primary season with <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s primary on Tuesday, followed a week later with primaries in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, other states were wrapping up the final rounds of their delegate selection with state and district conventions over the weekend. In <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, ousted Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was removed from office by a state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial and faces still another trial on criminal charges, was selected as an at-large delegate to the Republican National Convention. No presidential candidate was claiming him, and other state politicians were openly hostile toward his candidacy. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who earlier lost in his bid to be one of the three delegates from a congressional district, said he would support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and would concentrate on the Republican's choice for vice president. Delaware Republicans picked 17 national convention delegates on Saturday, including former Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who withdrew from the race for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> each made slight gains in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where Democrats wrapped up their delegate selections on Saturday. Conventions also were being held this weekend by Democrats in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>.

 An art school apologized in newspaper advertisements Sunday for exhibiting a student's portrait of late Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> in lingerie, but criticized the way it was removed by black aldermen. `` All educational institutions encourage students' freedom of expression,'' the School of the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said in full-page ads in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Sun-Times and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. `` Regrettably, in the use of his freedom, this student created a work that had the effect of insulting the memory of an important leader, Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>.'' The student, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, depicted <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in a frilly white bra, panties, garter and stockings, holding a pencil and frowning. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> died of a heart attack last November. The painting was hung in a students' exhibition at the school but was confiscated by police Wednesday when black aldermen stormed in and said it disgraced the city's first black mayor and threatened public order. `` We do not approve of the method used by members of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> who entered a private space within the School and forcibly removed the painting from the wall, even though we recognize the intensity of feeling on the part of those aldermen in this situation,'' the ad said. The ad was addressed `` To The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'' and carried the names of <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>'s board of trustees, and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of the School of the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> has not given interviews since the dispute began and did not attend his class' graduation ceremonies at the school Saturday. <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Harakal </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the art institute, said his diploma would be mailed to him. The painting has been returned to him, but the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> has said it would file a civil rights lawsuit challenging the police department's authority to remove the piece. The portrait has been a rallying point for blacks all week. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supporters scheduled _ and then canceled _ a march Saturday from <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> to the art school. `` We thought it best to let things cool off for awhile,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a former aide to the late mayor. `` We are going to continue to monitor the situation ... but I think the Art Institute has seen the error of its ways.'' Reporters who arrived at a plaza opposite City Hall to cover the scheduled march instead found art students who also canceled a planned rally of their own. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Medosch </PERSON>, a student at the school, said students wanted to `` avoid a confrontation'' with blacks. `` We did n't want to see anyone hurt,'' <PERSON> Medosch </PERSON> said. `` We're not backing <PERSON> David </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> -RRB-, we're backing our rights.''

 Republican nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, intent on discussing high technology Saturday at the <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> microchip plant, instead heard about the need for higher taxes and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s signature on the trade bill. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was quick to disagree with <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> board chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON>, who said the semiconductor industry needs the trade bill and higher taxes can help balance the budget. <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON> had shown the vice president the company's semiconductor manufacturing facility outside of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. High technology and the environment were the topics for the third day of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Western swing in advance of the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> primary on Tuesday and the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary three weeks hence. The Republican heir-apparent donned a `` full FAB bunny suit,'' in which he was garbed from head to toe in special overalls that keep dust at a minimum, as he viewed the sophisticated <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> facility. Later, when <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON> briefed the vice president on the company's situation, taxes and a provision of the trade bill _ the 60-day notification of a plant closing _ came up `` I do n't think that there is any chance of a balanced budget without new taxes,'' <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying he is worried about the supply of capital for investment in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` That's not a popular subject this year ... We need to promote savings.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his mind has not been changed. `` It did n't at all. I do n't think the next president has to, provided we get a grip on spending ... I disagree with him on that,'' he told reporters after a speech to <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> employees. <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON> also said the semiconductor industry needs the proposed trade bill, brushing aside <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s criticism of the measure. The president, in his weekly radio address, repeated his vow to veto the bill, citing the plant-closing provision. `` The plant-closing aspect of the trade bill does not seem onerous to us,'' <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON> said. `` It is no less than we would do in any case.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> again disagreed, backing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the issue. `` I was very interested in his position. It does n't change my mind,'' he said. But the vice president praised the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> plant-closing law, which his likely Democratic opponent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> uses as an example to support the call for a federal law. `` It's not a big problem for companies like this, but what you do n't want to see is disincentives to start new businesses,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters. `` In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, they have a plant-closing law. It's voluntary. It's not like the federal government imposing it.'' At his last event of the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized the furlough program in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> _ backed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ that allowed some criminals weekend breaks from jail. `` Believe you will never see from me a program like the one in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to let these murderers out of jail ahead their sentence running out so they can go out and kill again _ like one of them did in that state,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a crowd at a rally in <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>. The state legislature recently eliminated that furlough program. On the subject of the environment, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> needs to take the issue back after years of allowing the Democrats the right to lay claim to it. `` For too long, we have given away the playing field to the Democrats on the environment. I want to make the environment a Republican issue,'' he told the cheering crowd of about 800 Republicans late Friday night in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` I would like to be remembered the same way as <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> _ next to the national security, it's the condition of the Earth that you will leave to generations to come. We can do better,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was scheduled to visit a tree nursery near <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, on Saturday, take a raft trip Sunday and visit a tree research lab in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday.

<HEAD>CDC Official Warns Educators Of Need For Prevention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The AIDS virus will reach epidemic proportions among young people, educators were told Saturday, unless a comprehensive prevention program on the disease is implemented in every school, at every grade level. Health officials at the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> believe adolescents experimenting with sex and drugs seriously risk contracting the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolsman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s director of health promotion and education. `` We ca n't think -LRB- AIDS prevention -RRB- can be carried out through a pamphlet or a 15-minute lecture,'' <PERSON> Tolsman </PERSON> told an audience of more than 100 educators attending a conference on AIDS and education. `` We need a comprehensive program taught in health education classes by trained health education personnel to fight this problem,'' he said. `` We need your help to make sure adolescents understand what AIDS is and how it is prevented.'' <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> officials teamed with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to sponsor the three-day conference, which concludes Sunday. Educators received guidelines for educating students about AIDS and discussed AIDS infection among teenagers. The guidelines propose efforts at all grade levels, including early elementary school programs that reduce fears of an epidemic and teach students that the disease is not spread through casual contact. Late elementary and middle school programs should inform students about the disease itself, and junior and senior high school students should be told of the risks of contracting AIDS through sex or intravenous drug use, say the guidelines. Some educators expressed reservations about the plan. `` School health officials can not do this alone,'' said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugstad-Vaa </PERSON>, a biology teacher from <LOCATION> Burnsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> `` AIDS is an epidemic and it covers every thing from biology, home economics -LRB- and -RRB- social studies to economics. `` It's not just a health problem,'' she said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, added that the entire school staff should receive AIDS training because children often receive advice from their bus drivers, janitors and cafeteria workers. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, AIDS has affected 973 children under age 13, 260 teenagers and more than 61,000 adults, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. The disease has killed more than 34,000 people. `` The numbers in these groups -LRB- children and teenagers -RRB- are tiny when compared to adults, but still the numbers are staggering,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Droutman </PERSON>, medical epidemiologist for the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>.

 The infant who provided the five vital organs transplanted into 3-year-old <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> had been murdered by her father, police charged. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirks </PERSON>, who originally told authorities his 7-week-old daughter was injured in an automobile accident, was charged with first-degree murder in the death of <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chadwell </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s vital organs were donated to <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>, who was the longest survivor of a five-organ transplant until her death Wednesday of organ failure caused by a blood infection.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did n't win <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s first-in-the-nation caucuses last February, did n't even come in second But now that he's the likely nominee, slightly embarrassed <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Democrats are falling in line behind the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. Not the least on their minds is 1992, and the prospect of losing the status of putting the first mark on the primary season. `` That's a key factor,'' said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> party chairwoman <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, who admits her endorsement of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> last week was partly designed to curry favor with him in hopes he'll look kindly on <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in 1992. `` Naturally, I give great thought to that.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came in third in the Feb. 8 caucuses, behind winner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and runner-up <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. But Missouri Rep. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> dropped out of the presidential race March 28 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the senator from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, suspended his campaign on April 7, leaving <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to battle for the nomination. About 3,000 Democratic activists were trooping to congressional district conventions Saturday to begin picking a slate of delegates that will bear only a passing resemblance to the much-ballyhooed outcome of the precinct caucuses. At those meetinngs, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> claimed 12 of the delegates elected, while <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> forces won nine technically uncommitted delegates, most of whom are expected to endorse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during the next month. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> claimed seven delegates, while <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was awarded six. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s backers had hoped to maintain their status as a group in hopes of electing their leaders to delegate slots, but most are epxected to turn to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. That is n't surprising, party leaders say, because a certain amount of flexibility has always been a trademark of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Democrats. `` We have to realign probably more than any other group of Democrats,'' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. `` It requires us to be quite facile and most <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Democrats are, in fact, pretty flexible.'' `` Our delegation's makeup follows the idiosyncrasies of what's happening on the campaign trail and matches what's happening,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON> `` Part of the good thing about the four-step system we have is there are points along the road where people can step back, change their allegiances and, in a way, go with the flow.'' <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was the launching pad for the Democratic presidential race three months ago, but the rest of the nation was n't buying the direction the state wanted to head. Ms. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Democrats do n't have to be told twice that it's time to switch gears, and they were moving to do that Saturday. She traveled to conventions in all six of the state's congressional districts urging activists to elect national convention delegates loyal to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` I think it sends a pretty strong message that it's a good time to start thinking about November,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> lawyer and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backer. Party rules call for Iowans to pick 34 of the state's 61 delegates to the Democratic National Convention at those district conventions. The only suspense was whether <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s loyalists could hang together long enough to elect their leaders to cherished delegate slots, technically uncommitted but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backers in reality. `` Most of them are <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> people, but I think you'll see a lot of them commit to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> even before the state convention,'' <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s delegate selection process is a complex affair, and only the first stage is shoved into the nation's political limelight. The precinct caucuses were essentially a straw poll of whom was favored among the 100,000 or so activists who showed up and elected delegates to the next step, conventions in all 99 counties. Delegates are n't actually elected until the district conventions, and the race routinely has changed by that point. The final 18 delegates are chosen at the party's June 25 state convention. Ms. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> spoke as if she expected the shift all along. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did remarkably well here,'' she said. `` Those folks were very close together in reality. Those three people did very well.''

 Army and civilian rescuers chipped away at concrete slabs Saturday to try to reach two people still missing in a building collapse that killed at least 15 people, officials said. A state communique said the death toll from Thursday's collapse rose to 15 on Saturday and may go as high as 17. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> listed 19 dead, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrade </PERSON>, in charge of special services for the local agency said. Rescuers believe they have located the body of one of the missing and believe the second also is dead, said the communique issued Saturday. Fifty-seven people were injured in the accident and 12 of them hospitalized, the report said. The governor of <LOCATION> Aguascalientes </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, visited the site Saturday and said an investigation to determine why the four-story building collapsed will be stepped up Monday.

It is common in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for buildings to be occupied during construction of upper floors. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Romo </PERSON>, owner of the furniture factory in this state capital 320 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said paperwork for indemnization for relatives of the victims will begin Monday, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 Ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pledged his support to President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on Saturday and promised that if she let him come home for his mother's funeral, he would not try a coup. About 5,000 people rallied to demand that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> be allowed to attend the funeral of his mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, who died May 4. She was 95. No date for the funeral has been set. Family members have been hoping Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> would change her mind about <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> attending. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ruled out allowing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return. The government also said Saturday that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> must repay the billions he allegedly stole during his 20 years in power before he can come home from exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and ordered its consulate in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to block his return. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman Gemmo <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> read <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' statement by telephone from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> lives in exile. In the statement, broadcast by <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> radio stations, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> promised he would not exploit his return to undermine her government. `` I reiterate that I oppose violence, that I have no intention of mounting a coup d'etat or causing a civil war,'' the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> statement said. `` I, therefore, advise my supporters and those who are fighting for the very same democratic principles that I stand for not to engage in any disruptive and more violent activities.'' But in a telegram to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, the presidential palace said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> remained convinced <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return would undermine national security <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters have been linked to several attempts to topple the Aquino government. The telegram, released by the palace to news organizations, also said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> would `` allow him to come back if he returns all the wealth he stole from the country.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government claims <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates siphoned off up to $ 10 billion during his 20-year administration before he fled after a February 1986 popular uprising. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' statement also urged his supporters to `` join forces with Madame Aquino'' to oppose communist rebels and others who `` challenge the stability of the current government.'' The ousted president said that allowing him to return would `` not only adhere to the noble principle of humanitarianism but also would unite various political forces ... into an overpowering force which would prevent bloodshed ... and at the same time solve the present economic sufferings of our people.'' On Friday, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> claimed he was negotiating with <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to return for the funeral. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON>, said Friday's statement was meaningless, and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> told reporters that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials `` just have n't been involved at all'' in negotiations regarding <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> loyalists gathered in 100-degree weather Saturday and marched to the <LOCATION> Mendiola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> about 300 yards from the presidential palace. March leader <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Panelo </PERSON> said they would remain there until Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> reversed her decision or <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> appeared before them. But by sundown, the crowd had largely dispersed. Protesters carried banners reading `` Give Us <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> or Give Us Death.'' Others claimed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was the only one who could stop the communist insurgency, which erupted and spread nationwide during his administration. Also Saturday, a bomb exploded at military headquarters, killing one soldier, officials said. The building has been vacant since being set ablaze during an August coup attempt. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Anselmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabingan </PERSON>, a military spokesman, said the victim was believed to be a member of a roving guard force and apparently picked up an explosive device left after the coup plot failed. `` It's an accident,'' <PERSON> Cabingan </PERSON> said. `` It ` s not connected with anything political or whatever. It's just a simple accident as we see it.''

As it happened, the shortstop for the other team, <ORGANIZATION> Manoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION>, doubles as that church's pastor, and he did n't find it entirely humorous. `` The pastor saw it, and came over to our coach to express his concern about it all,'' <PERSON> Hunsberger </PERSON> said. `` I mean, after all, it is a church league. `` See, it was all supposed to happen after the game _ when the other people had left. But people were still around, and there were even some kids there ... it all happened so fast.'' <PERSON> Hunsberger </PERSON> said nothing offensive was intended and he hopes nobody gets in trouble with league or sponsoring church officials over it. Some had an inkling before it happened. <PERSON> Hunsberger </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>, gave <PERSON> John </PERSON> an emphatic `` Stop'' sign from the third-base coaching box as <PERSON> John </PERSON> rounded third after hitting a grand slam. But poor <PERSON> John </PERSON> did n't get it, until the `` policewoman'' arrived, nattily attired in a blue uniform and badges, searching for `` the owner of that red Cavalier over there.'' `` He thought it was real at first,'' said <PERSON> Hunsberger </PERSON>'s teammate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Azarian </PERSON>. `` But after about 30 seconds he figured it out.'' <PERSON> Azarian </PERSON> said the woman stripped down to a bikini.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> arrived Saturday evening in poor, terrorism-plagued <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and heard a plea from President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> to reach out to `` those who are sick with hate and who kill and destroy with violence.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, on a 12-day, four-nation mission to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, arrived from neighboring <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> on an antiquated Aeroperu DC-8 jet. At <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s airport he expressed his sympathy with `` the huge multitude that has experienced grief, violence, abandonment and hunger'' in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. Later Saturday evening, scattered blackouts attributed to leftist sabotage hit <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> while the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was addressing priests, nuns and seminary students but did not affect the downtown area surrounding the colonial-era cathedral where he was. Outside the cathedral in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s central plaza the pope consecrated a Peruvian version of the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. Tens of thousands of people cheered, waved white handkerchiefs and shouted, `` Viva,'' Spanish for `` long life.'' Then the pontiff retired for the night in the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. Small dynamite charges exploded in at least four spots in the city during Saturday night's papal activities, but police said no one was hurt. Authorities attributed the blasts to insurgents. Earlier in the day about 20 women disrupted a Mass in a Roman Catholic church in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, the capital, and appealed in the pope's name for respect for the rights of leftist rebels held in local prisons Guerrillas in a mountain town ambushed an army convoy and killed three soldiers. A military intelligence officer, who spoke to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity, said two men posing as police with automatic rifles were arrested on the papal motorcade route from the <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> airport to downtown. He said there was an order to shoot and kill any armed suspect near the pope. Echoing a theme he stressed before in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> cited <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s `` hunger for bread'' and called on its citizens to build `` a more fraternal and just society.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a nationalistic social reformer who has halted virtually all payment of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s $ 14.6 billion foreign debt, demanded a fairer shake for poor nations of the Third World. `` We reject the usurious terms of the foreign debt,'' the president told <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> at the airport. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, left the tropical Bolivian city of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> earlier Saturday. `` Do n't go away, holy father. Do n't leave us,'' Bolivian vice president <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayllon </PERSON> told the pope during a farewell ceremony, repeating a chant heard throughout the pontiff's five-day Bolivian stay. Addressing a Mass on Saturday in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> basin city of <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> insisted that `` constant, intense, honest and efficient work by everyone'' was needed to overcome poverty. `` We ca n't expect everything from outside.'' It has been three years since the pope has been to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, a country bloodied by an unrelenting leftist insurgency. When he was here in 1985 he pleaded with rebels to abandon their armed struggle to overthrow <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s elected government. But the violence is worse than ever and the country is submerged in a serious economic crisis. Inflation expected to top a record 400 percent this year year and the country has virtually no dollars left in reserves to maintain imports and economic growth. On Sunday the pope planned to celebrate an open air Mass, meet with church officials and business and cultural leaders and close a conference of Latin American bishops. Monday he continues on to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, his last stop. Police said the women who occupied the church Saturday surrounded a priest saying Mass and held a large banner reading: `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, intercede for our brothers, political prisoners.'' Witnesses said police took the protesters away in vans. Police confirmed the incident but said they had no information on arrests. The women identified themselves as relatives of prisoners accused of belonging to the pro-Cuba <ORGANIZATION> Tupac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a small rebel band active since 1984. The government President <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who took office in 1985, is also plagued by the fanatical Mao-inspired <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, which launched its insurgency in May 1980. Shining Path guerrillas Saturday ambushed an army convoy near the <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Huancasancos </LOCATION>, killing three soldiers wounding three others, the military said in a communique. More than 10,000 people have died in the violence since 1980, including rebels, policemen, soldiers, public officials and civilians. More than half of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s population of 21 million people live under states of emergencies in different parts of the country.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite months of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions and a crumbling economy, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is hardening his position and preparing for months or possibly years more of confrontation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A confident <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Friday sallied into the provinces, where he was cheered by peasants and hailed by small-town officials. Accompanied by several colonels in a show of military unity, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s defiant leader, accused in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of drug trafficking, dismissed prospects for a negotiated settlement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s comments to journalists indicated he considers himself and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> a test case of historical proportions and that he is determined to rise to the occasion and challenge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> might. `` Everything fell apart,'' he said in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Negrita </LOCATION>, 90 miles west of the capital, when asked about recent U.S-Panamanian talks aimed at resolving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political crisis over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s leadership. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, citing unidentified sources, reported in its Sunday editions that negotiations were at a delicate stage and that administration officials believed a deal would be struck within a few days or the talks would collapse. The administration is offering to drop drug-trafficking charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if he relinquished office Aug. 12 and left the country, the newspaper said. In addition, the administration would continue to recognize ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> but also would allow <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s handpicked chief of state, to continue as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s acting president through the May 1989 elections, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said there were conflicting reports on when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> under the deal, but one source said it would be after the elections. On Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media also reported that a Washington-Noriega deal was nearly complete. They said it involved <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> stepping down and accepting temporary exile in exchange for dismissal of the drug charges. His lawyers plan to appear in court to request dismissal of the drug charges in about a month. They contend the charges are politically motivated. `` The general is n't going anywhere,'' his spokesman, Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>, where small-town mayors met with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. A document signed by 505 mayors called <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` the incarnation of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s struggle against imperialism'' and praised him `` for walking among the humble and speaking their language.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, a mestizo of lower middle-class origins, has tried to present the crisis as a conflict pitting a domineering <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> allied with local rich white `` sellouts'' against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s darker-skinned and poorer majority The military commander, whose fortune is estimated at up to $ 1 billion, and his propaganda machine have succeeded to some degree in selling that version locally and in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. A divided opposition has been hamstrung by carefully applied repression that gets the job done without deaths. All opposition media have been closed. `` <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s dignity is not negotiable while there are foreign troops on our territory, humiliating our soil, while there is economic aggression, as long as there are threats, as long as there is psychological war,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>, adding, `` and as long as -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> does n't get out.'' About 10,000 American soldiers are stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Southern Command. The month of August, when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> completes 25 years of military service, has been mentioned as a possible retirement date. But he said Friday the date of his retirement is none of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s business <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said nothing prevents the general from commanding the Defense Forces for several more years if he and the high command see fit. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoy who has been talking with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s representatives in recent weeks, was still in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Saturday. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, who described the talks as stalled, said <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> might go home this weekend. But he also said it was in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's interest to make it appear that negotiations were continuing, even if they offered scant hope of progress. `` In the middle of an election campaign, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is backing -LRB- vice president -RRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 100 percent, has to save face because of the big bungle they've made,'' he said. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>'s assessment of prospects for the talks was bleak. `` <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> comes each time with the same plan _ the original plan a little more elastic. It is a deadline for -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- resigning his post, a deadline for leaving the country.'' he said. `` It is a plan that the general and the Panamanian republic can not accept.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told reporters: `` The experiment of -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- aggression that exists in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is a testing ground that later could be applied to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> or any country.'' The general faces other pressures, however, beyond those from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The country's economy is collapsing under the strain of the crisis. A team of five respected economists published a study this week saying production was half of normal because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions and banking restrictions. They said more than a quarter of the work force will be unemployed within months, even if the political crisis were resolved tomorrow. They raised the specter of hunger and said it would take at least two years of intensive recovery measures and massive international aid to get the economy back to a semblance of what it was a year ago. They said recovery can not even begin until the political crisis stemming from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s hold on power is settled. But that appears further off with each passing day. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is one of the few opposition leaders who has not gone underground or into exile. He said Thursday that, though there are no more anti-government street demonstrations and other protest has been quashed, `` The crisis has deepened in that society simply refuses to function.'' He said he believes <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> realizes he can not hold on indefinitely.

 <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> celebrated its 40th birthday Saturday with a marathon concert featuring performers from its early years as a pioneering rhythm-and-blues label to its latest pop and rock stars. A full house at Madison Square Garden heard the Coasters kick off the show with a lively `` That is Rock' n' Roll,'' then settled in to hear the likes of <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Stills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Flack </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plant </PERSON>. The Bee Gees and The Average White Band revived their dance hits of the 1970s, and Yes and Foreigner pounded out the music that made them mainstays of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>'s stable in the'70s and'80s. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, the 17-year-old pop star from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, said she was excited to represent <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>'s `` new generation'' and sang a medley of her songs. <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>'s roots in R & amp; B and soul music were represented by <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>, <PERSON> LaVern </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and others, as well as a tribute to the late <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Redding </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> called it a `` family reunion.'' <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>, on hand to perform his hits `` Land of 1,000 Dances'' and `` In the Midnight Hour,'' said the best part of the day was `` getting to see some of my old friends, like <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. This is really a gas for me.'' After the Coasters' upbeat opening song, the show pulled back a notch with ballads from <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Flack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stills </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>. But within an hour, the arena was cooking again to the British soul of The Average White Band, the jumping jazz of <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> and the rich and rolling blues of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>'s first big stars. <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>'s great contribution to the music world, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> told the audience, was `` showing it was all right for white kids to listen to black music.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>, Stills and <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> teamed up for renditions of `` Wooden Ships,'' `` Our House'' and `` Carry On'' that were received enthusiastically. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON>, producer of the extravaganza, said the influence of early R & amp; B artists are evident in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>'s younger rockers. Saturday's show featured both `` the roots and the fruits'' of the independent label, he said. All 11 hours of the show were sold to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for live transmission and Home Box Office scheduled about four hours of the show Saturday night.

 Impeached former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, facing trial this week on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan, proclaimed faith in his innocence but uncertainty about whether he will be acquitted. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> remained in the spotlight Saturday, attending his state party convention and narrowly winning a seat at the Republican National Convention. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was removed from office April 4 by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, could be sentenced to up to 22 years in prison if found guilty on all six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents. His brother and 1986 campaign treasurer, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, will be tried on three similar counts. The legal woes did not stop delegates to the state Republican convention Saturday from picking <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> to be one of the state's 33 delegates when the party convenes this summer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> finished 17th in the balloting for 18 at-large delegates after losing a bid for one of the delegate seats allocated by congressional district. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, one of the 717 delegates to his state party convention, said before voting that he believed he had `` strong support'' from rank-and-file party workers. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supports Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was not on their list of recommended delegates. Told the results by reporters, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said `` Hurrah'' and thrust his right fist upward. `` Well, for not being on a slate, that's not too bad,'' he said, adding `` this was not a referendum on me.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., placed 10th in the at-large balloting with 296 votes to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s 271, and said he would attend the convention despite earlier reluctance to serve in a delagation with <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> `` Amazing,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said of the vote. `` I respect the decision of the convention. I have no other comment about it.'' In the criminal case, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his brother are accused of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan from <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> by failing to report it on <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s personal or campaign financial statements. `` I have committed no crime,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 64, said in a telephone interview last week. `` I should be found innocent because I do n't feel myself guilty as far as I can see. However, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> shied away from predicting he will be exonerated by a <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury and indicated he still may be open to a plea agreement if it did n't involve pleading guilty to a felony, a condition that prosecutors have rejected previously. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s 15-month governorship was a stormy one, beginning with his cancellation of a Martin Luther King holiday for state workers and ending with his repeated claims that his political and legal problems were the result of a massive conspiracy. He was removed from office when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of trying to thwart an investigation into an alleged death threat and misusing $ 80,000 from a protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> dismissed a charge stemming from the campaign loan after some senators argued that voting on it would prejudice <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s criminal case. On Monday, attorneys were set to present oral arguments before the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on a defense request to throw out the indictment. If they fail there, defense attorneys plan to go to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. If there is no delay, jury selection is scheduled to begin Thursday. In insisting that he broke no laws, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has advanced several arguments: _ That the October 1986 loan was actually reported properly because it was lumped with other funds and listed as a $ 465,000 loan from <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> to his campaign. The funds were lumped together as a `` time-saving matter,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said. _ That the failure to report the loan was an `` honest mistake'' by <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who filled out the financial reports `` the best he knew how.'' _ That <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is the victim of selective prosecution because other public officials have amended their reports without facing criminal charges. _ That in any case, whether the loan was properly reported or not, there was no criminal intent to hide it. The prosecution, however, is expected to point to a letter from <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> in which he promised the loan would `` remain confidential.'' Another key piece of evidence is a November 1986 receipt that showed a $ 350,000 contribution to the campaign from <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, although he acknowledged he made no such contribution. None of the attorneys involved _ prosecutors <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> defense lawyer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Keilp </PERSON> _ is tipping his hand on trial strategy. But among the witnesses expected to be called are a number of key players inside and outside the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> administration, including former top aide <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. She was one of several co-signers of the <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> loan and later was the object of the alleged death threat that became the centerpiece of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment conviction. The governor's successor, Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, was subpoenaed by the defense to testify about her knowledge of the campaign finance reporting law. She herself is under investigation for omissions from her reports, which she recently corrected. If the trial begins as scheduled, jury selection will start with distribution of a questionnaire designed to ferret out people with obvious bias. For his part, defense attorney <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said, `` I'm confident that he should be acquitted.'' But he added, `` I'm not confident that it will happen.''

 Two Chinese men who hijacked a jetliner from the mainland to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> were air force veterans who had worked as radar operators, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said today. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> said it was weighing charges against the men.

<HEAD>Steel Workers' Struggle Wins Sympathy of West Germans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It was n't typical for postwar <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ steel workers staging wildcat strikes, seizing a bridge, setting up vigils, storming a corporate meeting. For six months the workers struggled to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Rheinhausen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> steel mill from closing down, a victim of economic decline in the Ruhr, the long-time industrial powerhouse of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In the end, the workers lost their fight, widely covered by newspapers and television, but they won hearts all across an astonished nation. Celebrities, politicians, students, right wingers and left wingers, even groups in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, raised voices of support. Donations of money came from around the country for workers involved in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest in years. `` During the winter, wealthy women started collecting toys and clothes for what they called ` those poor <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> children','' said the Rev. <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelp </PERSON>, a Lutheran pastor. `` But I said, this is n't the Third World, and there has n't been any war or bombing. It's just a question of jobs.'' Kelp had joined the workers in their vigils outside the plant's front gate, sometimes standing in front of a cross with the word `` Solidaritaet'' -LRB- Solidarity -RRB- on it `` Solidarity'' became part of the local vocabulary. `` Our workers' Solidarity fund got contributions from all over <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Rheinhausen </LOCATION>'s village manager, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleer </PERSON>. `` They came from <LOCATION> Flensburg </LOCATION> in the north to <LOCATION> Passau </LOCATION> in the south.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s tiny <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> donated 260,000 marks -LRB- $ 160,000 -RRB-, the much larger Social Democrats roughly the same, while businesses, `` average people'' and a host of others brought the total to 1.3 million marks -LRB- $ 828,000 -RRB-, <PERSON> Kleer </PERSON> said. `` You have to be amazed at that much support.'' The workers' representatives nevetheless admitted defeat May 3, coming away only with a promise that the plant will stay open until the end of 1990 and that efforts would be made to find other opportunities for the 5,300 workers. Only a massive and unexpected reversal in the steel industry's fortunes could keep <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> from shutting the mill down after 1990 Company officials say the mill, 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION>, has lost more than 1 billion marks -LRB- $ 613 million -RRB- since 1980. `` The fight is over. It's a real defeat for us,'' said <PERSON> Mafred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruckschen </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> Rheinhausen </LOCATION> mill's works council, the workers' representative body that agreed to the compromise. A <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, called it `` a victory of reason.'' The compromise provides for job placement at a nearby mill for some workers, rehirings outside the steel industry, newly created jobs and early retirements. But <PERSON> Bruckschen </PERSON> said workers now must concentrate on making sure the new jobs come about. Many people have expressed doubts about that, he said. During the workers' struggles, the word `` Rheinhausen'' became synonymous with the economic decline of the <LOCATION> Ruhr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. In the last two years, the area around <LOCATION> Duisburg </LOCATION>, the city that includes <LOCATION> Rheinhausen </LOCATION> village, has lost 20,000 jobs, most of them in the steel industry. Unemployment in Duisburg stands at 17.6 percent, compared with the nationwide average of 8.9 percent. The work force in the steel industry, centered in the <LOCATION> Ruhr </LOCATION>, has fallen to 150,000 from a peak of 500,000 in the 1960s. The <LOCATION> Rheinhausen </LOCATION> works was built in 1897, joining the <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> empire that later provided the German industrial muscle for two world wars, and helped rebuilt the country over the past four decades. Like other Ruhr steel plants, <LOCATION> Rheinhausen </LOCATION> has been hurt by declining demand and competition from countries with low labor costs. `` People have now realized how powerless politicians are,'' said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leimkuehler </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> works council and a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member. `` They've seen how just a handful of managers can pass judgment on an entire region.'' <PERSON> Mehmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Aslan </PERSON>, one of about 700 Turks working at <LOCATION> Rheinhausen </LOCATION>, also talked of the politicians. `` The politicians say, ` Go south and get work in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>,''' he said. `` But I know young people who've done that ... and could n't find apartments `` Some of them wound up sleeping in cabins in the woods.''

<HEAD>Battle Over Public Education Divides Oregon County</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, which relies more than almost any state on local property taxes to pay for schools, there's more than money at stake in the acrimonious fight over one county's tax vote Tuesday. Residents of southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Josephine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> are debating the future of public education itself. One group, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, has suggested leasing public schools to a private corporation, saying the schools are too costly and inefficient. Supporters of the proposed multimillion-dollar property-tax measures for the Grants Pass and <LOCATION> Josephine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school districts say the local economy is suffering because of uncertainty about school funding. They believe children will suffer if the tax measures are rejected. `` Public education is not the only means of achieving education,'' argues <PERSON> Signe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Josephine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have a lot of private schools in the county, a lot of parents who are involved in home schooling.'' A political consultant enlisted to help pass the measures, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, says the tax fight is the most divisive he's seen in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> `` I do n't think the system of public education in <LOCATION> Josephine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is going to survive without constant support on the part of folks, many of whom have given up,'' he says. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s school-financing woes long have been blamed on the state's dependence on the local property tax. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> ranks <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> third nationally in its reliance on local revenue: 66.6 percent of its school financing comes from property taxes. Oregon has no sales tax. `` The great, progressive state of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> ought to stick its head under the pillow,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> says. `` It ought to be ashamed of the way it funds public schools.'' <LOCATION> Josephine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> voters are known for their strong anti-tax sentiment, born of the 1970s tax revolt and maintained by the well-organized and vocal taxpayers' association. Many residents moved to the county to escape high land values and taxes in other states. But many, too, consider public education the foundation of democracy. `` We've had some professional people refuse to move here because of the situation,'' says <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a leader of a pro-schools group formed several months ago in response to the anti-tax forces. `` We've had people putting their houses on the market because if the tax bases do fail, they wo n't be able to sell them.'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> dismisses <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s claim that her association is out to destroy public education. A teacher who left the profession in 1960, she insists the schools could be run more efficiently. `` We have the lowest per-capita income of any county in the state, and yet the public employees, the teachers and administrators, want the same salaries and benefits of everywhere else,'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> says. State figures, however, show the <LOCATION> Josephine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district will spend $ 3,335 per student this year while Grants Pass will spend $ 3,627, well below the state average of $ 4,007. `` They're not on the bottom, but they're close to the bottom,'' says <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Koscher </PERSON>, a statistician for the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> used to force schools to close when voters repeatedly rejected tax measures. Last year <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> voters approved the so-called `` safety net'' law, which allows districts to levy the previous year's property tax if voters wo n't approve more money. The safety net has its holes, however. If other revenue sources decline and expenses rise, the previous tax levy quickly becomes inadequate. <LOCATION> Josephine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s school districts and their 9,800 students face major staff and program cuts next fall if they fall into the safety net again. The districts in recent years already cut staff, closed schools, increased class sizes, and postponed equipment purchases. Some school buses in Grants Pass have been on the road since 1959, superintendent <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> says his school board will begin work on a $ 1.5 million budget cut Wednesday if voters reject the city district's proposed $ 12.2 million tax base. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON>, county schools superintendent, says his district faces a $ 2.5 million cut if its $ 14.3 million tax base is turned down. That could mean 25 teacher layoffs and elimination of extra-curricular activities and field trips, among other cuts, he says. `` I'm embarrassed that the state would allow a district to do the things we're looking at doing, the cuts in staff and programs,'' <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> says. `` I'm embarrassed to live in a state that would let that happen.''

The fight by Tamil guerrillas for an independent nation for their minority people broke out in 1983. The Tamils, who are 18 percent of the island's 16 million people, claim they are discriminated against by the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON>. Since 1980, at least seven major films have been produced around the lush mountains, dense jungles, rivers and waterfalls near <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION>, barely a three-hour drive into the hills from the capital of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Villages near <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION>, once the capital of a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> kingdom, have been villages everywhere from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in various movies. `` <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> has managed to cheat as countries like <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Asoka </PERSON> <PERSON> Perera </PERSON>, managing director of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> Film Locations Limited. <PERSON> Perera </PERSON>'s company helps scout locations for movies, and he said <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s success in drawing filmmakers is due to a lack of red tape involved in shooting here. One of the first major movies made in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> was in 1956 when director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lean </PERSON> filmed his hit movie `` Bridge on the River Kwai'' on the island, then known as <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION>. The film about British POWs in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> who are forced to build a bridge for the Japanese during World War II, won six Academy Awards. The movie was set partly here, so when <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> escaped a Japanese prison on <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and made his way through fierce jungle and across sun-baked seas to a British base on <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION>, he was really just around the corner from where he started. Paramount's `` The Purple Plain'' with <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, also about the <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> campaign during World War II, and `` Elephant Walk'' starring <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> in a movie about a <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION> tea plantation, were both made in 1954. But <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> lost out as a location for foreign movies from 1970-77 when the pro-socialist government led by the <ORGANIZATION> Sri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lankan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> viewed anything coming from the West as decadent. It was not until 1980 that the trend was reversed when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Derek </PERSON>'s `` Tarzan the Apeman'' was filmed starring his wife, <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Derek </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Since then, movies shot in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> have included the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas-Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> `` <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jones </LOCATION> and the Temple of Doom''; `` Mountbatten _ the Last Viceroy''; `` Light Over the Water,'' which was set partly in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>; `` Further Adventures of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Buck,'' in which <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> masquerades as <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>; and `` Jungle Heat,'' in which the country plays itself. `` Iron Triangle,'' about an American troop operation in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, completed production here in February and is to be released later this year. It stars Beau Bridges and <PERSON> Haing </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngor </PERSON>, who won an Academy Award for supporting actor in <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON>'s critically acclaimed `` The Killing Fields.'' <PERSON> Jayantha </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayatillaka </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> Film Locations Limited, said films made here earn the country needed foreign exchange and give a boost to the tourist industry. Expenditures on filming in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> were reported to be $ 8 million for `` <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION>,'' $ 5 million for `` Tarzan the Apeman'' and $ 3 million for `` Iron Triangle. <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s mix of cultures also helps producers find `` extras'' for their projects, thus reducing their costs, <PERSON> Jayatillaka </PERSON> said. `` For the making of ` Iron Triangle,' Sri Lankans of Chinese descent and those who were descendants of traders from <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> were recruited to play Vietnamese,'' he said. But <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s ethnic conflict, born from that same cultural mix, has blocked filming on some parts of the island, <PERSON> Perera </PERSON> said. `` Some of the scenes of ` Tarzan the Apeman' were filmed at the beaches in eastern <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> district in 1980 before the violence broke out,'' he said. `` Since 1983, we have to stay clear of the north and east despite the fact there are some beautiful locations there.'' But <PERSON> Perera </PERSON> said spectacular scenery and miles of palm-lined beaches exist elsewhere on the island. The island is being considered for a movie about a journalist in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> during the overthrow of President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. The movie's star, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilling </PERSON> of the Australian TV series `` Return to Eden,'' was recently in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> with producer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Markowitz </PERSON>. Keeping with the international spirit of moviemaking here, the production is being handled by an Australian company.

 Boasting experienced and cheap crews and what it says are the biggest film studios in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> lures Western producers to make movies they say they could barely afford to film at home. The latest foreign films being made in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are an American-West German co-production starring <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> and <PERSON> Klaus-Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandauer </PERSON>, and a British family fantasy `` The Wolves of Willoughy'' featuring American soap opera queen <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Forstater </PERSON>, producer of `` Wolves,'' he saved about $ 2.8 million, or 40 percent of total production costs, by making the film in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and not in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Other advantages were guaranteed snow _ not often seen in southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in March _ and a manor house near the Bohemian town of <LOCATION> Hradec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kralove </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Forstater </PERSON> said was a perfect 1850 copy of an English manor house. He also had the good, cheap craftsmanship of the setmakers at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s Barrandov studios, billed as the largest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In March, the second tract of the studios was transformed into a huge and gloomy Victorian laundry with an enormous cauldron in one corner. Ragged orphans, played by some of the 100 Czech children chosen to take part in the movie, washed clothes on a set that gave the feeling of stepping into a <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> novel. <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> said in an interview that she was embarrassed by the disparity of wages between herself and the Czech crews. `` We work long hours, but we get paid for it,'' she sighed. There are five categories for remuneration of local actors. A senior Czech actor can get up to $ 90 a day, but most crew members would get much less. Overtime is not paid. What <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> did enjoy was not being known or recognized in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> streets. `` It's lovely; it's great freedom,'' she said. `` When I get a wolf whistle, it's for me and not for my TV role.'' The biggest complaint on the set was the scarcity of vegetables. <PERSON> Forstater </PERSON> said the crew sent a bus to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> once a week to get produce. `` Usually when I ask people what I'm to bring when they are on location, they ask for chocolates. Here they want carrots and cauliflower,'' said food consultant <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Keen </PERSON>. The language barrier also sometimes posed a problem. Czech handlers for the 16 Alsatian dogs dressed up to look like wolves had to get their commands translated from English, and then instruct the dogs. But the Czechs are used to coping with such difficulties. <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s state-owned film company first made a film for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in 1958, when <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> hired them to produce `` <PERSON> Popeye </PERSON>, the Sailor Man'' and `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>.'' In 1964, the West Germans made the first full-length feature film shot by Westerners in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Business slowly built up, until <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> had a $ 3.4 million turnover in co-productions and foreign orders by the end of the 1960s. Now, five or six full-length foreign features, mostly West German, about 30 short films and 10-15 TV films are made each year. The most famous films made in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in recent years include `` Slaughterhouse Five,'' the film version of <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Vonnegut </PERSON>'s anti-war fantasy novel made in 1971; `` All Quiet on the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>,'' a remake of the 1930 classic shot in derelict miners' houses and open cast mines in 1979; Barbra Streisand's `` Yentl'' in 1982; and the Academy Award-winning `` Amadeus'' in 1983

<HEAD>Cuban Detainees Find Freedom or Frustration in Wake of Riots</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Six months after desperate Cuban detainees took 138 hostages and seized control of federal prisons in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, the government is paroling them in unprecedented numbers. But the government program baffles some of the inmates and their lawyers. They complain that the parole policy is incoherent and inconsistent, quickly releasing scores of men yet keeping hundreds with sometimes minor criminal records behind bars without apparent reason. According to the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, 1,093 detainees have been freed since the uprisings, compared with 92 released in the six months preceding the riots. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials deny the uprisings prompted the accelerated release policy. In all, since the riots ended in early December, 2,224 Cubans have been recommended for release and 1,208 have been deemed unfit for the streets, said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Twenty-four detainees have been marked for deportation, and 300 more will have their fates decided in panel reviews by May 31. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> promised the full reviews as part of an agreement that ended the riots, in which one <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> detainee was killed and several others were injured. None of the hostages was injured. The 2,400 men in detention at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> last fall had committed crimes after arriving in this country from the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION> in 1980, when <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> allowed 125,000 Cubans to leave. At the time of the riots, however, the detainees had served their sentences and were being held indefinitely at the behest of the INS. Some had been held in this legal limbo for more than four years when they learned that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had reactivated a 1984 agreement for deportation of `` excludable'' immigrants. The <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> center erupted in flames on Nov. 21; the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> prison fell to the Cubans two days later. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would later lay partial blame for the riots on the scant four-hour notice given prison officials by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> siege ended after eight days, but <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s uprising went on until Dec. 4, becoming one of the longest in federal prison history Damage at the two prisons was estimated at $ 64 million. The prisons were shut down, and the detainees, some of whom insisted they would rather die than return to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, were scattered to prisons across the country. Since then, most of have been held in `` lockdown'' status, confined to special seclusion areas 23 hours a day. `` They just sit in those cells, waiting and getting depressed,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, whose common-law husband, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Casalis </PERSON> <PERSON> Noy </PERSON>, was approved for parole in November but has yet to be released. Despite the release statistics, some advocates for the detainees _ including Bishop <PERSON> Augustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, who helped end the sieges _ maintain the government has not completely lived up to its promise. `` The detainees are n't being given full reviews, they're just being interviewed. What's more, the government does n't even make an official record of these panel reviews, something you must have if there is to be an effective appeal process,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellingson </PERSON>, a Legal Aid attorney in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> who has sat in on more than 70 interviews conducted by the 20 two-person <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> review teams. The pace of the reviews has stepped up since the riots, detainee advocates say. Late last month, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said the accelerated, post-riot releases reflected a more liberal parole policy. However, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Raynsford </PERSON>, associate counsel at <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I assure you these people are not being more favorably treated because they rioted.'' He said the number of parolees has risen sharply because the review procedure implemented last June was slow and laborious, and only recently began to bring about large numbers of releases. `` There's a cumulative effect at work here,'' he said. `` Our parole approval rate remains slightly above 60 percent, the same as it was before the riots.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> LeShaw </PERSON>, an attorney who works with the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Support Cuban Detainees, said his office is still swamped with calls for help. More than 1,100 men approved for release remain in prison `` for one reason or another, such as a shortage of halfway houses or lack of sponsors,'' he said. Supporters of the detainees note that, prior to the riots, all but about 20 of the releases were to halfway houses. Since December, hundreds of detainees have been freed directly to their families and sponsors. `` Some detainees are being released right away, almost pushed out onto the street, while others, including some who have good prison records and committed far less serious crimes, remain behind bars for months,'' said <PERSON> LeShaw </PERSON>. `` Nobody seems to know what's going on.'' Although the 20 review teams might differ in style and approach, <PERSON> Raynsford </PERSON> said all look for the same thing in making recommendations: `` Whether the detainee is presently non-violent and likely to stay that way, whether he is likely to present a threat to the community, and whether he is likely to violate his parole.'' He also noted that a special appeals tier had been created for detainees who are turned down for parole. Even those who have been scheduled for `` repatriation'' to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> can appeal. `` But these are just paper appeals,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Ellingson </PERSON>. `` You do n't get to face your accusers. Besides, it's just another case of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, which has been responsible for the incarceration of the detainees, acting as their judge and jury.'' She gave a recent experience as an example of why the process is so frustrating: `` Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Dismas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit facility in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, recently interviewed 45 detainees who had been approved for parole. The halfway house took 18 of them and left the others stranded in prison, not even knowing why they were n't selected, much less when they would be released.'' Asked why, the director of <ORGANIZATION> Dismas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, said he had room for only 18 detainees. `` We try and look for motivation, that's the most important thing,'' he said. But Ms. <PERSON> Ellingson </PERSON> said other factors are involved, such as a detainee's appearance and his ability to speak English, `` things that really should n't matter that much.'' Even some detainees who have been released question the fairness of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> process. One of them is <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, who was released in March, just three weeks after his panel hearing. `` I think I was released so quick because my wife went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> several times and talked to congressmen and reporters about my case; she really worked hard for me,'' said <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, who finished serving 26 months in 1986 for possession of a deadly weapon with intent to use it. `` But,'' he added, `` I'm one of the lucky ones. There are others still in lockdown who have good records and committed lesser crimes than I did. I really ca n't figure out what's going on.''

<TEXT>
 The resurrection of the <ORGANIZATION> Oakdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> is under way, six months after it was nearly destroyed by rioting Cubans and none too soon for many Allen Parish residents. `` If it reopened tomorrow, it would be six months too late,'' said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Strother </PERSON>, a 25-year-old resident of this south central <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> town of 7,200. `` I'm ready for it to reopen,'' she said. `` In fact, I've applied for a job there. Last Nov. 21, the 1,000 Cubans held here pending federal decision on their future went on a rampage at the news that some would be deported to their native land. They burned 10 of the 14 buildings at the $ 17 million center and took 28 guards hostage. Two days later, Cubans at the federal penitentiary in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> followed suit. That uprising lasted until Dec. 4, while the siege at <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> ended after eight days. Assistant Warden <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON>, a 25-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>, arrived at the <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> center the night before the Cubans rioted. `` I've been through riots, but I've never been to a place before where they burned the place down,'' <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said. A pair of dormitories, which escaped with only broken windows and some minor damage, serve as temporary administration offices and housing for about 45 inmates maintaining the site. Inside, bright white, orange and yellow paint makes the dormitories nicer than those on some college campuses. There are no steel-gray cells with bars and wire mesh here. `` If you would have walked in the first day after it was over, you would never have believed people who lived here would have destroyed it, as nice as it was,'' <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said. Despite the destruction, <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said he had no animosity toward the Cubans. `` Inmates are inmates. Just because they burned the place down we ca n't say we do n't want those types here,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report released earlier this month placed some of the blame for the <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> riots on prison officials. It said they failed to recognize signs of impending trouble. The report also said placing Cubans at the <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> facility, a low - to medium-security alien processing center, was a `` calculated risk. <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said rebuilding the center will cost more than $ 13 million and should be finished by Oct. 1. The prison should being taking new inmates by November. <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowad </PERSON> said he'd been assured by federal officials that the prison would not again be home to a large group of a single type of illegals, such as the Cubans from the 1980 Mariel boatlift. `` Any concentration of Cubans, our people would be upset with,'' <PERSON> Mowad </PERSON> said. `` The people of <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> were very proud of that facility. And then to go out and see it destroyed ... it was hard.'' <PERSON> Mowad </PERSON> says those worries are n't enough to keep the town from eagerly anticipating the prison's reopening. `` We had 100 percent support for it before it burned. After the riot it dropped to about 90 percent, but we've got most of those people back.'' After the <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> center is rebuilt, a second phase called <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> II is tentatively scheduled to open in November 1989, <PERSON> Mowad </PERSON> said. With both facilities operating, the 500 federal jobs would make the detention center the city's No. 1 employer. Each month since the riot, <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> has lost $ 6,000 in water, sewer and sales tax revenue, <PERSON> Mowad </PERSON> said. A few reminders of the uprising remain. The once landscaped grounds and paths at the prison now have patches of bare earth glaring in the sun. In some areas not yet scrubbed and repainted, slogans remain, such as `` Muertos No <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'' _ `` Death, <LOCATION> Not </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.''

 These days, a visitor can drive directly through wide-open iron gates and park within 20 yards of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION>'s front steps. Those are the same steps descended by 89 hostages when they poured out of the prison last Dec. 4, ending an 11-day uprising by more than 1,100 Cuban inmates. The penitentiary then was less a prison than a badly damaged fortress under siege. The front steps, patrolled constantly by armed federal officers, led to a building only partly controlled by authorities. The rest was in the hands of Cuban detainees, who rioted at word of a deportation agreement with <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. When it was all over, the prison was emptied of all inmates for the first time since it opened in 1902 and officials began cleaning up the damage. Officials estimated the damage here and in <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, where Cuban inmates staged a similar uprising, at $ 64 million. Now, 600 inmates, all Americans, are housed at the prison, compared with about 200 Americans and 1,400 Cuban inmates at the time of the takeover. In two years, the number is to reach 800 to 850. So far, there are no plans to bring Cuban detainees to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Caltabiano </PERSON>, executive assistant to Warden <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>. The riot interrupted a $ 63 million, five-year renovation project, but many of the areas damaged were to be razed in the renovation anyway, <PERSON> Caltabiano </PERSON> said. The only real loss, he said, was the burned-out prison industries building. A temporary industries unit has been set up in a former gymnasium. There, inmates repairing mailbags and making mattresses and meteorological parachutes earned $ 500,000 for the prison in April, <PERSON> Caltabiano </PERSON> said. A 20-foot-high chain link fence is being erected to cut the prison almost in half. Behind it, most of the construction will go on. The first phase of the renovation project is to be completed next year. Elsewhere, vandalism in the dining hall and chapel has been repaired. `` It's been the positive attitude of the staff that's made it, by putting this kind of thing behind them and saying, ` OK, we're going to see how we can rebuild <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,''' <PERSON> Caltabiano </PERSON> said The prison is `` <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'' or `` USP -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Penitentiary -RRB- <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'' to its employees. It was known as the `` Big A'' to decades of inmates, including the famous and the infamous. At the dawn of the 1920s, the `` Big A'' was home to Socialist presidential candidate <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Debs </PERSON>, who was imprisoned for a speech condemning war in World War I. It held <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> in the 1930s, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> spy <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Able </PERSON> in the 1950s and Mafia informant <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Valachi </PERSON> in the 1960s. In the late 1970s, there were 16 slayings at the prison, many described as professional `` hits'' related to drug sales. By 1978, a report by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> suggested closing the penitentiary because its old design and deteriorating structures made security impossible. The prison was to have been closed by the fall of 1984. But the number of Cuban inmates, detained during the Mariel boatlift because of their records in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> or imprisoned later for offenses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, mounted. Violence again was a problem. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> reported the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> pen had less than 10 percent of all federal prisoners, but almost 20 percent of all assaults on inmates or guards. The Cubans frequently protested prison conditions but more often complained that they were being detained at all. The final uprising was triggered by word that deportations to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> would resume.

 <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutterfield </PERSON> spends his nights at the federal detention center in <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, trying to forget the nightmare he lived through last fall, when he felt like a pawn in an eight-day stalemate between rioting <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> inmates and federal officials. <PERSON> Sutterfield </PERSON> was one of 28 hostages taken Nov. 21 by Cubans who rioted at <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> after a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announcement of a pact with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to return some of the detainees to their homeland. Twenty-six of the hostages were held until the siege ended Nov. 29. <PERSON> Sutterfield </PERSON> was among them. `` That's a feeling you never forget,'' <PERSON> Sutterfield </PERSON> said. `` You just try to forget and get back to work.'' Dentist <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Belchinsky </PERSON>, chief medical officer of the federal penitentiary in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, was among 108 people taken hostage there two days after the <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> uprising. His freedom came 11 days later. He said he decided to jump right back into work as his way of dealing with the ordeal. But in a recent interview, he lashed out at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for `` ill-advised ... stupid remarks'' regarding the deal with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and for giving prison officials so little notice of the pact. Of the 108 guards and other prison workers taken hostage in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, 91 have returned to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>, although not all of them in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Caltabiano </PERSON>, executive assistant to the warden, said 16 had yet to return to work and one had resigned. Authorities declined to say how many of the <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> captives have returned to work. After the riot, <PERSON> Sutterfield </PERSON> went to a temporary duty post at a federal prison in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. He is now back at <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> supervising inmates on the graveyard shift. Although he's eager for reconstruction to be completed at the prison so it can start receiving inmates and he can get back to being a guard, he says he still remembers fearing for his life during the riot. `` Every time the helicopters would come up, -LRB- the inmates -RRB- would handcuff us to chairs and stand ready to kill us,'' he recalled. `` Even today, hearing a helicopter _ that's one thing that brings it back. `` Having to deal with dying so many times over, you got to the point where you thought, ` If it's going to happen, let's get it over with,''' he said. `` A lot of people still have a problem with it. They still have nightmares.'' Lt. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Howington </PERSON>, who as captain of the guard at the time of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> riot was the highest-ranking hostage, said he was more frightened after the episode after `` hearing that there were so-called death squads out'' to get him. `` That even bothers me now.'' `` In that 1,600 Cuban group, there were 300 or 400 incorrigibles, no doubt about that,'' <PERSON> Belchinsky </PERSON> said. `` But thank goodness the other 1,200's opinion kind of pervaded and kept those guys down.'' <PERSON> Sutterfield </PERSON>, 22, said counseling with others who'd been held hostage had helped him. `` I do n't have any bad feelings towards the Cubans,'' <PERSON> Sutterfield </PERSON> said. `` I sympathize with their cause, but the way they went about achieving their goals I hold against them. `` It's hard to say whether I could work with -LRB- Cuban inmates -RRB- again. I'd have to give it a try.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> officials say they have not decided what the mission of the <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> center will be after renovation is finished. <PERSON> Belchinsky </PERSON> and others held hostage in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> say government officials must stand by pledges made or implied to the Cubans. `` Hopefully they'll come through with them,'' he said, `` because there are other Cubans in the system and if they see that Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> does n't keep his word, it could be maybe a problem for other staff in other institutions, saying ` Hey, they lied to us the first time. If we get control again, we might kill people.'''

 The letters pour in, 30 to 50 a day, from federal prisons in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Some of the letters to <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Bishop <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> begin with a cheery `` Hello, <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON>.'' But they quickly turn into desperate pleas for help. Six months after he helped end riots by Cubans detained at federal facilities in <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, Roman can not understand why hundreds of them, even those with jobs and families waiting outside, sit in federal prisons throughout the country, fearful they will be deported to their Communist-governed island. `` I do n't think the government has broken the agreement they signed,'' Roman said in a recent interview. `` But they have not kept the spirit of the agreement.'' The soft-spoken 60-year-old Roman, who was expelled from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s takeover and became the highest-ranking Cuban-born priest in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> archdiocese, was the key guarantor of the pact that helped end the fiery uprisings in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>. Roman, already well-known in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> community, was called to the <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> negotiations by prison rioters. When he arrived, he told the inmates, may of whom wept at the sight of him, to lay down their arms. They obeyed. Inmates in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and their supporters in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> then demanded Roman negotiate at the penitentiary as well. But nervous government officials said they were reluctant to bring him in, fearing that if he failed the riot would turn uglier. Instead they negotiated an agreement with the inmates by promising to have Roman monitor the agreement. Roman attended the signing ceremony that ended the siege. The agreement promised that prisoners would have their cases reviewed in exchange for releasing their hostages. The inmates were dispersed, and the prisons closed. Roman helped set up a task force to monitor the pact; he meets each Monday with its members for the latest news. For the most part, it has n't been good. Roman points to the file of a prisoner officially given his release in November, but still waiting inside a federal prison. `` These are people who have completed their sentences, sometimes as much as three years ago,'' he said. `` They have families, they have jobs waiting, but still they are not free.'' He shows a computer printout containing more than 1,000 names of prisoners he says could be released immediately, yet are hung up in red tape. The riots followed news of an agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for the deportation of `` excludable'' immigrants. `` What started all this is the terror of deportation,'' Roman said. `` Terror of deportation to a country that we know does not respect human rights _ and that terror continues.'' He and members of his committee feel the promises made during the uprising are fading. Even though Cubans are gradually being released under a review program, <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> says his committee does n't understand `` why some people without families are being released to the streets, while those with families are not. The situation is especially frustrating to families who must painstakingly look for jobs for their loved ones before the inmates can be released. Sometimes, the jobs are gone before the government has acted. Those who do get out are a good bet to stay out, the bishop says. He runs a special 15-week counseling session for released prisoners and their families. They recently had a mass meeting of members of the program, and <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> says every ex-prisoner had a job. Despite the publicity that dogged him during the riots, <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> said his life remains the same. `` For a clergyman, for a bishop, when one problem ends, another one begins,'' he said. `` We know clearly that we are on a trail of troubles our whole life, a very narrow trail.''

 <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> is philosophical when she talks about the bureaucracy of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> And </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, but there's an underlying current of anger in her voice. `` I've tried and tried to find out why they wo n't let <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> come home but so far nobody has explained it in a way that makes sense,'' she said in an interview. Her common-law husband, 46-year-old <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Casalis </PERSON> <PERSON> Noy </PERSON>, an inmate at the federal prison in <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is one of some 1,100 Cubans in federal detention who have been approved for parole but are still awaiting release. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueiras </PERSON> has been paroled. But his wife, <PERSON> Reyna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON>, still fears he might be deported because of the damage done by the Cubans during the uprisings last fall at prisons in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not going to let this go by,'' said <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON>. `` Some way, I think they'll make them pay.'' <PERSON> Casalis </PERSON> <PERSON> Noy </PERSON> arrived in this country in the 1980 Mariel boatlift and later served eight months in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prison for possession of cocaine. When his time was up, however, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> sent him to the federal penitentiary in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where some 1,400 other Cubans with criminal records waited to learn what lay in store for them. `` <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> was brought to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in December 1985, and we came here from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, three months later,'' said <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, who lives with her two children from a previous relationship and works as a nanny-housekeeper for an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> family. While trying to get paroled, she said, her husband worked in prison industries and kept out of trouble. `` He was sending us money, up to $ 100 a month there for a while,'' she said. `` And we could see him every week. Then, last November, he finally was approved for parole. Everything looked great, I even had a job lined up for him.'' Then came the riots. The Cubans detained in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> were moved to prisons throughout the country. `` That messed everything up,'' <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> said. `` But when I finally tracked <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> down in late December I was told he was going to have to go to a halfway house somewhere.'' <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> said she began trying to get her man sent home instead. After numerous dead-ends, she said, she reached a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> official working with the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` She told me Manuel could n't come home because he was on the list to go a halfway house,'' <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> said. `` But I told her I had made a good home here and that I know a lot of detainees are being sent home and they did crimes a lot worse than <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> did. Besides, there's a long wait to get into the halfway houses.'' In the six months since the riots, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has sent hundreds of detainees home. Some, like <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, were paroled within a few weeks of their interviews by a two-person INS panel. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, who served 26 months for possession of a dangerous weapon with intent to use it, said he was released and sent home to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, just three weeks after his interview. He credited his quick release to his wife's contacts with congressmen and reporters. He said he was puzzled that some Cubans convicted of lesser crimes remain behind bars. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials refuse to discuss the cases of individual detainees with reporters. <PERSON> Figueiras </PERSON> was transferred to a federal facility in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, after the riot. He has since been released to a halfway house and now has his own apartment in a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb, his wife says. <PERSON> Figueiras </PERSON> must serve his eight-month parole in the area. <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> has sent two of her children to be with him and says she will make the trip with her remaining two children when she saves enough money. `` It's good news that he's out, but right now we're going through hard times,'' she said. <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> is the only one who remains of a small group of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> women who had moved to <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> to be near their husbands and relatives inside the prison. `` The people here -LRB- in <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> -RRB-, they still do n't like us,'' she said. `` My older kids, they were always crying, ` We want to leave here.' `` For me, I'm still afraid,'' she said. `` The small children play together, but I stay inside by myself. `` If I had the money in my hand I'd be gone right now.''

<HEAD>The Right To Write: Should Regan Have Kissed And Told?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was talking last week about two things: what <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said and whether he should have said it. Beyond the spate of jokes produced by his revelations about Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s fascination with astrology and the president's passive management style, there arose a debate over the ethics of kiss-and-tell books. `` If you want to contribute to history, it wo n't hurt to wait until the administration is over,'' said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former spokeswoman But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>, former press secretary to President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, said administration figures should be able to tell their stories whenever they wish. `` Speech in this country is free,'' says <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>, who teaches journalism ethics at <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unless those people had agreed that they would not do anything like this, I ca n't see it as being unethical.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s book, `` For the Record: From Wall Street to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' is a biting account that some feel weakens an already lame-duck presidency. He portrays a choeographed president, manipulated by aides and by a wife who depends on an astrologist for guidance in fixing the president's schedule. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has denounced the book as `` a bunch of falsehoods'' and a `` breach of confidence'' but not given a detailed rebuttal. Being kissed by the heady power of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and then publicly telling the story, especially when the president still sits in the Oval Office, is to some dishonorable, to others a valuable contribution to history. The president's former chief of staff, ousted from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last year in a move widely believed engineered by Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, says he never considered delaying his tale. `` I did n't set the time of my leaving this administration and I do n't know why I should hold up ... Many people have left this administration and told their stories. Why not my book?'' he said in an interview. His is one of several negative accounts by former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> officials. Former White House spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> offered damaging characterizations of former colleagues in his book, `` Speaking Out.'' He says he may have overstepped `` the bounds of propriety in some instances'' but addes: `` I apologize not for the truth in my book _ nor the telling of it.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former budget director, caused a furor two years ago with `` The Triumph of Politics: Why the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Revolution Failed,'' which lays out errors in judgment and miscalculations <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> says were responsible for adding $ 1 trillion to the national debt. `` I wrote the book because I have an ax to grind,'' he said then, and to correct `` a gigantic mishap of governance.'' Ironically, one of those who warned <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> against being too candid was <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, then treasury secretary. Just why the Reagan-era books have been so angry and revealing is a provocative question. <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> says he has never encountered books `` as violent'' as those spawned by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency and adds: `` There is obviously something in that White House that is filling people with a sense of rage.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, the first lady's former spokeswoman, dismisses that theory. `` This is not a problem peculiar to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration,'' she says. `` There's big money being offered and staff have become more powerful. It's the cult of the personality. A lot of people who worked in the White House in the'50s were nameless and faceless. In the'80s they have high-profile jobs that bring a lot of personal attention to them.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> political science professor who studies presidential character, notes that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> books have a `` remarkable consistency in the picture they convey of this White House.'' `` Where is the book that overwhelmingly corrects these supposedly false and unjust smear jobs ... that straightens it all out, that shows that the president was really in charge?'' he asks. He believes such books help citizens learn how policymakers do their jobs and whether their `` values are right.'' That thought is echoed by historian <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who says these memoirs are a `` venerable genre in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political literature'' that should not be withheld. `` How else can history be written if those who make it take vows of silence?'' he said. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kernell </PERSON>, a political science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> who is studying the White House staff, says the proliferation of such books reflects `` the growth of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the centralization of power'' in unknown people making vital decisions. He notes that the White House staff has grown from about 40 people in 1939 to nearly 500 today. Those people `` have tremendous influence on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> policy. So we're naturally curious about them. That's why they get on the cover of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> and why their books are marketable.'' On the other hand, telling how an administration operates while it is still operating can put a damper on administration programs. `` The proposition that there even are going to be kiss-and-tell books does erode the sense of collegiality within government,'' says <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> scholar who served on the <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> staffs and has studied the presidency and the press. `` If you sit there at a table and you know that everybody is going to run back and write in their diary, it will affect what you can say and how you say it,'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> says. `` It becomes simply an ethical consideration, based on each person's moral code, whether they're going to tell tales out of school. It tells you something about those people.'' Some have suggested presidents ask incoming aides to sign a promise not to write until later. `` What ever happened to the First Amendment?'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> says in response. `` Do n't we have as much right to write? I could see if that applied to state secrets. But I do n't describe how to make an atomic bomb.'' <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s press secretary who wrote a book targeting the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> press corps, says he promised his administration colleagues `` they were n't ever going to have to see their top-of-the-head statements and analyses tossed back at them years later'' in one of his books. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> says the promise was his idea and was not put into any formal agreement. Many feel such agreements, probably unforceable in any case, would only underscore an atmosphere of distrust. There may always be people who put loyalty to the president behind the prospect of financial gain, celebrity status or avenging some real or imagined slight. `` Presidents get what they deserve. They either generate a sense of loyalty among the members of their staff or they do n't,'' says <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> bristles at the notion that he has been disloyal and recalls how he was `` hounded out of my office.'' Loyalty, he says, is a two-way proposition. In the end, says <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, `` I could either write this book and tell the whole truth or not write the book at all. I chose to write the book.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> says he first saw the Vietnam Veterans Memorial at daybreak as he re-created the story of how the wall became a reality in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` To Heal a Nation.'' `` I'd never seen it before and I got there just as the sun came up,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` I was the first person that day to walk its length. Halfway, I saw my reflection. I narrowed my focus to just one name. `` The wall became very dear to me. It has the names of 50,000-plus boys who died serving our country, for better or worse. I was devastated and very proud to portray the man responsible for the fact that it was standing there.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> infantryman who led the effort to build a memorial to his fellow veterans in hopes of healing the nation's wounds. Working with <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON> were <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Doubek </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>. The memorial, 493 feet of black granite set into the ground in a giant V, polished to a mirror-like finish and inscribed with 58,156 names, was designed by <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ying </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> architect who was a 21-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> architectural student when her dramatic vision was selected from among 1,421 entries. It attracts up to 20,000 visitors a day, making it the most-visited memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. The two-hour movie, a special GE Theater presentation based on a book by <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swerdlow </PERSON>, will be televised Sunday. It also stars <PERSON> Glynnis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Colt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Luckinbill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Linden </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chetwynd </PERSON> wrote the screenplay, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressman </PERSON> directed. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said when he started the film he looked into <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON>' military record and talked to people who knew him `` I held off meeting him until I was halfway through the picture,'' he said. `` He is an incredibly decent man. My belief is he pursued the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Memorial for all the right reasons. I admire him and I'm proud to portray him. `` He had no illusions of grandeur. One of my favorite lines from the film is, ` This is not a monument, it's a memorial.' It's not a memorial to the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. It's a memorial to the 50,000 young men who died there.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said he sees <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON>, who is now attending law school, as `` a living definition of the American dream come true.'' `` He wanted to get something done and he pursued it. It got done and it will live forever. It's wonderful for everyone in this country to pursue his own vision. It's worth it, I think.'' This is a rare television appearance for <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who was nominated for an Oscar for his role in `` Runaway Train.'' He was also in such movies as `` Star 80,'' `` The Pope of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>,'' `` Raggedy Man,'' `` Nobody's Fool'' and the upcoming `` Blood Red.'' He made his TV debut in the soap opera `` Another World'' and has been in several PBS dramas. `` I do n't go by the media,'' he said. `` What attracts me is the script. I liked this and I came running. Limiting myself to one medium is like limiting myself to redheads. I took this part because of the script, because of my friendship with three <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and because people my age were too young to be for or against the war. Now that I'm an adult I think it's about time we said, ` Welcome home, guys.''' His upcoming movie, `` Blood Red,'' is a Western due out in July. It also stars <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giancarlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Giannini </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' father. `` It's loosely based on the time the railroad came to the <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It came to this particular vineyard and the Italian immigrant who owned it would n't sell a right-of-way. He died suspiciously. I, as his son, take to the hills. He holds up the railroad so long they go around the <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. It saved the <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> for wine growing.'' This fall he plans to star in a movie called `` Centrifuge,'' based on a novel by <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>.

 Bond prices showed resilience in the face of a stormy week, when fears of higher interest rates swept through financial markets like a hurricane. And the bond market, which also had to contend with three major <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> auctions this past week, is bracing itself for more turbulence ahead. Interest rates, which move inversely to bond prices, are widely expected to continue climbing. `` In the short run, we still think rates are headed higher,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Held </ORGANIZATION>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Anxiety about inflation _ which erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds _ had been building for some time It was heightened by a May 6 government report on the nation's unemployment in April, which registered a 14-year low and was viewed as showing underlying strength in the economy In the aftermath of that report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> nudged short-term interest rates higher, and on Wednesday, major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks raised their prime lending rates by half a percentage point to 9 percent. The hike in the prime rate _ the first since October's stock market collapse _ proved anti-climactic, though, since it had already been foreshadowed by a rise in bond-market rates spurred by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s tightening. `` The prime rate -LRB- increase -RRB- really was old history,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, a managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A far more exciting event for the bond market was the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s series of three quarterly refunding The sales of $ 26 billion in Treasuries on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, aimed at helping the government finance the $ 2.5 trillion national debt, were fairly well received by investors. There had been concern recently that the growing inflationary fears, by keeping bond prices depressed, could jeopardize the auctions. The bond market had been worried that investors _ especially the Japanese _ could shy away from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> sales if they detected a trend toward higher interest rates. As it turned out, foreign investors did jump in to the auctions. They accounted for about 40 percent of the bond purchases over the three days, Ms. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> estimated. The bond market rode out the interest-rate tempest and the auctions fairly calmly. Some market analysts suggested the credit markets may have been cushioned by a `` flight to safety'' on Wednesday, as skittish investors pulled their funds out of the tumbling stock market and plowed them into bonds. The anxiety over interest rates and the hike in the prime sent the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials down 37.80 points that day to 1,965.85, a three-month low. Many observers expect the rate on the key 30-year bond to rise to around 9.50 percent by the end of June, as inflationary pressures continue to mount. Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report on wholesale prices in April, showing only a moderate rise of 0.4 percent, was encouraging news for bond traders at the end of an unnerving week. But the market is looking forward with trepidation to a string of economic statistics for April due to be published this coming week: industrial production on Monday, factory capacity in use on Tuesday, housing starts on Wednesday, and consumer prices and real earnings on Friday. The nation's trade deficit for March is also scheduled to be reported, on Tuesday. The trade figures have been a powerful influence on the bond market in recent months, as disappointing trade performances have pushed the dollar lower and weakened bond prices in turn. If the reports provide further evidence of economic strength, the inflation fears could accelerate.

 <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> was about to book an order for 100 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and 100 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> this past Wednesday when his customer happened to ask how the market was doing. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> mentioned that the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 35 points _ and the customer promptly canceled his order. That is the kind of experience that drives brokers crazy. Retail business in stocks is off 30 percent or more on Wall Street because the October crash and the subsequent gyrations have shaken the confidence of individual investors. `` They're frightened,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Odd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, who said his own discount brokerage's business is off 50 percent. To many Americans, Wall Street is just another roll of the dice, especially in light of the 508-point drop in the Dow Jones industrials on Oct. 19. That came across in a sampling of opinion around the country this past week. `` I think it depends on your personality more than anything else. Some people like to gamble,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, traffic and purchasing manager for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` It's a little bit like the race track. ... Influence controls it as much as anything,'' said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who manages the tool and die shop at <ORGANIZATION> Lacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Novi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` I favor other investments that are more dependent on my own ability to judge investment potential, like real estate,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Studdard </PERSON>, general manager of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaGarde </PERSON>, a concrete company in <LOCATION> Anniston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. Small investors accounted for only 23 percent of shares traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in January and February, down from 29 percent just before the crash, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> Many investors are turning to safer havens such as certificates of deposit and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, whose value is up sharply since the crash in spite of some recent weakness. `` People are starting to invest based on their nocturnal habits. Will this investment keep me staring at the ceiling at night?'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxelbaum </PERSON>, national sales manager for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Computerized program trading has emerged as a villain in the public's mind, and even brokerage firms that say program trading is not to blame for upsetting the markets are curbing the practice anyway. This past week five major brokerage houses said they would stop conducting a form of program trading known as index arbitrage for their own accounts. They were Bear, <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, among others, had curbed the practice earlier, to the relief of many of its brokers `` I'm frankly thankful. It took me off the hook with clients,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, a broker in the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, office of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON>, a 78-year-old retiree from <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> who lives in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said he is keeping half his net worth in stocks even though `` like everybody, I got whacked on Meltdown Monday.'' But he said his confidence is being sapped by inexplicable moves in the market. `` The standard perceptions of value are way the hell off. It's unnerving.'' <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarailo </PERSON>, a secretary in <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said she was ready to buy stock in <ORGANIZATION> H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Block </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in January but was worried the market had not stabilized. She is glad she held off: After a brief run-up, the stock is off about $ 4 from its January level. `` I think the stock market boom is over,'' she said. To some Americans, trouble in the stock market is part of a broader crisis. `` I have seen the time when I felt safe anywhere I was,'' said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> tool and die man, who is a 60-year-old ex-Marine. `` It's not that way anymore. Whether you're talking money, or safety of anything.'' But there are still optimists in places such as Spanish Fork, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON> said program trading and the possibility of a bear market do not greatly concern him because he has more than 20 years before retirement and is holding for the long term. `` There's a lot of room for growth in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the stock market is the best place to take advantage of it,'' said <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON>, vice president for finance at <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sunshine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said he and his wife, <PERSON> Gail </PERSON>, have about a third of the money in their retirement plan devoted to stocks. At age 33, he feels he can afford at least that much risk. `` I consider it more or less a sense of gambling,'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said. `` But the greater the risk, the more potential you have to gain.'' Most investors who owned stocks have n't given up on them entirely. Rather, they are letting their cash build up so stocks become a smaller percentage of their overall portfolio, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markese </PERSON>, vice president and research director for the 90,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Markese </PERSON> said a survey in March found 80 percent of the group's members favored restrictions on program trading Sixty-three percent favored coordination betwen agencies regulating the stock markets and futures markets. `` I'm surprised and I think a lot of people are surprised at how little has been done'' so far to fix things, he said.

<HEAD>Wall Street's `Contrary' Optimists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If you apply an old Wall Street principle known as contrary opinion, the outlook for the stock market would seem to be pretty healthy. Hardly anybody these days is able to work up much enthusiasm either for stocks or for the business outlook over the next year or two. And from long experience, students of the investment scene will testify, whenever a large majority of people agree on what the financial markets are likely to do, they are probably wrong. The extent of the pessimism now holding sway among investment managers, analysts and economists shows up in the results of the latest poll of more than 300 `` decision makers'' conducted by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoey </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. For the stock market, <PERSON> Hoey </PERSON> reports, the bears outnumbered the bulls by 2-to-1 On bonds, the ratio was an even more lopsided 3-to-1 in favor of the pessimists. Anecdotal evidence abounds to support that heavy negative bias. The talk on Wall Street these days is that interest rates have nowhere to go but up. And the slow and halting recovery in stock prices since the crash last year is just about universally labeled a `` bear market rally'' that will soon run its course. `` The most comforting thing about today's experience is that many analysts believe the stock market rally can not be sustained,'' observed <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> CTT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a firm that manages more than $ 2.5 billion. `` The reason this is comforting is because whenever the crowd is anticipating one set of events, the market has been known to perversely confound everyone by doing exactly the opposite.'' As simple as contrary opinion sounds, though, it can be very difficult to practice. For one thing, in trying to determine what the real consensus is in order to go against it, you sometimes have to try to separate what people say from what they really feel. Lately, for example, some standard statistical measures of investor sentiment suggest stocks have not been beaten down to bargain-basement extremes like those seen on some past occasions. Price-earnings ratios of several leading market indicators lately have hovered between 14-to-1 and 15-to-1. The multiple is down from better than 20 last year, but still nowhere near the single-digit levels it reached at times in the 1970s and early 1980s. The market did not do much for optimistic `` contrarians'' in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at 1,990.55, down 16.91 points from the week before. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index fell .58 to 145.30; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market 6.94 to 372.48, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index 3.87 to 297.94. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 153.07 million shares a day, against 151.13 million the week before. The market's weakest moments in the past week did not exactly occur in a vacuum. Major banks raised their prime lending rates from 8.5 percent to 9 percent. What's more, a good many traders might have been reluctant to bid aggressively for stocks before the government's monthly report on international trade, scheduled to be released this Tuesday. `` So we go on to the next number, the dreaded trade statistic,'' observed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> in his latest market commentary. `` Is this the way we were supposed to invest, hanging from week to week on every flick of data? Ca n't we find some more stable criteria on which to judge the direction of the markets? `` We think that if you step back a little bit, you can. To our mind, the market today is dominated by fear, and that fear will ultimately prove overdrawn. Upon such realization will come an improvement in stock and bond prices.''

<HEAD>Energy Prices Fueled Moderate Boost in Wholesale Prices in April</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A moderate rise in wholesale prices during April despite a big jump in energy prices has prompted economists to conclude that inflation worries may have been overstated. The Producer Price Index rose a moderate 0.4 percent in April, down from a 0.6 percent advance in March, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Analysts noted that if the volatile energy and food sectors were removed, the April price advance was a minuscule 0.1 percent. `` It is hard to make a real scare story that inflation is taking off based on these kinds of numbers,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. For the first four months of the year, wholesale prices have risen at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, not much changed from the 2.2 percent increase for all of 1987 The report sparked a rally in the bond markets as investors concluded there will be no additional pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to drive interest rates higher to dampen demand. Prices of long-term government bonds rose as much as $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value to yield 9.17 percent. On Thursday the bellwether 30-year issue's yield jumped to its highest point this year at 9.22 percent. Other economists, however, insisted that the April price report contained some troubling signs that price increases will be accelerating in the months ahead. `` It would be a mistake to look at this report and say inflationary pressures have abated,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm. `` I do n't think this relief is going to last.'' Energy prices, which had posted sharp declines from September through February, accounted for half of the increase in the overall index in April, rising 3.1 percent. Gasoline costs advanced 0.7 percent, while home heating oil shot up 5.2 percent. Natural gas, which had declined in price in five of the last six months, rose 4.3 percent. Food costs rose 0.4 percent in April as a sharp 16.3 percent drop in the price of eggs and smaller declines in the price of fruit, fish and beef offset price increases for pork, chicken, vegetables and coffee. The financial markets took the economic news in stride. On Wall Street, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average climbed 22.55 points to close at 1,990.55. Brokers noted that there were no unpleasant surprises in the producer price index and instead drew inspiration from falling interest rates and a steady dollar. In another economic report Friday, the government said total business sales surged 1.9 percent in March, the biggest advance in more than a year, while business inventories were up a modest 0.3 percent. Analysts said the combination of rising sales and small declines in inventories should translate into continued strong industrial production in the months ahead.
