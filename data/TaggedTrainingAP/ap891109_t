 On the hurricane-battered island of <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION>, a practice site for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bombing off <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, residents link their destiny to a century-old tamarind tree on a barren hill. `` If the tree survives, so will <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION>,'' said engineer <PERSON> Sixto </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> after a ceremony to replant the tree, which was uprooted by Hurricane Hugo on Sept. 18. `` It has been silent witness to our history,'' <PERSON> Nana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castano </PERSON>, a retired teacher, told schoolchildren gathered around the tree. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has been part of <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION>' history since World War II. It owns two-thirds of the island and uses it for practice bombings and maneuvers. In the 1970s, <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION> was rocked by violent anti-Navy protests. Similar demonstrations in 1975 drove the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> off its sister island, <LOCATION> Culebra </LOCATION>. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> says relations have improved in recent years, many Viequenses, as the 8,000 residents are called, say Hurricane Hugo has made matters worse. <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION> was one of the areas hardest hit by the storm. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> pounded <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION> for 12 hours with winds clocked at 140 to 200 mph, demolishing or damaging virtually all its 3,000 homes. Trees were either knocked downed or defoliated, leaving the once-verdant, sun-splashed island with little shade. `` It will take 10 years to recover,'' said <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Davila </PERSON>, manager of a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> plant that makes electric switches and is the island's largest employer, with 132 workers. `` Now we are seeing the devastation,'' <PERSON> Davila </PERSON> added. `` In six months, a year, we will see the lack of income people will have.'' With their homes and possessions gone and their future livelihood in doubt, some residents despair. Officials say two people hanged themselves and several others attempted suicide after the storm. No one in <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION> died in the hurricane itself. `` There is lot of depression, a lot of suicide attempts,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Almodovar </PERSON>, who is in charge of the emergency room at the <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` It's people who have lost everything. ... They do n't see a way out.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is helping rebuild roads and restore power and water. The day after the hurricane, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> put up a roadblock to prevent squatters from returning to a disputed area where they had set up shacks and burned two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vehicles in April. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravin </PERSON>, a high school history teacher, charged that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> acted `` like thieves in the night,'' taking advantage of the hurricane crisis. But a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, said the roadblock was put up because the squatters were `` unauthorized people on <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> property. The shacks had been blown down and were completely demolished.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bought <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION> land for training during World War II, resettling residents in the center of the island, which is 20 miles long and six miles across. Most of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> property is unused and hundreds of squatters have moved in over the past year. Rear Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> naval forces, said relations with <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION> residents have been `` very, very good.'' But squatter organizer <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, a carpenter who says his movement is `` rescuing land,'' believes the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> `` has a master plan'' to stifle development to keep the island to itself. Many Viequenses complain that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s presence has kept the island underdeveloped, underpopulated and poverty-stricken. <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION> has a severe housing shortage, an unemployment rate of 70 percent, and an annual per capita income of $ 5,281, as opposed to the <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> average of $ 8,721. The majority of the islanders are on welfare. Although its unspoiled beauty has made it the location for several movies, most recently `` Heartbreak Ridge,'' with <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> about the 1983 U.S.-led invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION> has seen little tourism. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> occupies two-thirds of the island and this prevents it from developing to its plenitude because they own the best beaches, the best land,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Manuela </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Collazo </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION> has been losing population for years, and is expected to lose 2,000 of its 8,000 inhabitants by the year 2000. `` A young <PERSON> Viequense </PERSON> who becomes an engineer, a doctor or a lawyer ca n't come back because there is nothing to do here,'' said <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Year Later Insurance Rates Still Not Slashed</HEAD>

 The first anniversary of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters' approval of Proposition 103 passed with citizens still waiting for insurance rates to be slashed Its author claims that while victory has been delayed, it has not been denied. `` What's at stake here is democracy and who's in charge,'' the initiative's author, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON>, told a press conference Wednesday at the headquarters of the Voter Revolt organization. The proposition, which has the force of law, called for 20 percent rollbacks from 1987 auto insurance rates. It also said that geography should be less important to setting rates than drivers' records and experience and made the office of insurance commissioner an elected position The major insurance companies, however, have not rolled back their rates in the wake of a court battle over the referendum. An estimated 700 companies were affected. They also have not begun judging rates according to driving records. The insurance commissioner, at least, becomes an elected position in the November 1990 election. On the anniversary day, <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> and <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> <PERSON> Collis </PERSON>, an elected state tax official who also is a candidate for the 1990 race for insurance commissioner, stood behind boxes marked `` $ 1,000 s'' symbolizing the 20 percent rollbacks still in insurers' coffers They said Prop. 103's promises would soon be realized if supporters keep faith. `` It's fair to say that for the first time we can see light at the end of the tunnel,'' <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> said. But they acknowledged frustration, and <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> fired salvos at state Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Roxani </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>. `` We are as frustrated as anybody else is,'' <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> said. `` It is an absolute outrage that we are basically 11 months behind schedule in the provisions of 103 that were supposed to go into effect on election day.'' Voters approved Prop. 103 on Nov. 8, 1988, on a vote of 4.8 million to 4.6 million. The next day insurers filed numerous lawsuits against it and a day later the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> suspended implementation for a review. By December, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had lifted the stay on implementing most of the measure except for the 20-percent rollbacks. To add insult to injury, the largest seller of auto insurance in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>, announced in January that it was raising rates an average of 9.6 percent. Prop. 103 was upheld by the high court in May, but the court said the commissioner should exempt a company from rollbacks if it would not receive what the court called a fair and reasonable rate of return. In early August the commissioner set the fair rate of return at 11.2 percent annually. By the end of August that figure had been characterized as tentative and could be revised upward. In the meantime, more than 400 insurance companies had filed for exemption from rollbacks and the commissioner said three of the state's largest insurance sellers were among hundreds likely to win exemptions. During summer hearings, insurance companies also told <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> she should continue to allow territorial rating systems in which prices are set according to neighborhood. As more rate hikes were announced and confusion over the status of Prop. 103 mounted, <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> on Oct. 2 ordered rate increases frozen for six months and said all issues would be taken up at hearings. <PERSON> Collis </PERSON> sought to put the best face on the developments. `` It's really important for people to realize on this anniversary of 103 that rollbacks have been delayed, the move away from territorial rating system has been delayed but it's now in the process and if we hang together awhile longer it's now going to happen,'' <PERSON> Collis </PERSON> said. The insurance companies want people to become apathetic about Prop. 103, <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> claimed. `` If you talk to the insurance companies they gloat about the fact that 71 percent of the people have said they do n't ever think that they ever have forced the insurance companies to give us those rollbacks,'' he said. Asked if he would have done anything differently, <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> said he should have incorporated criminal penalties into the law.

 `` Life is a thief,'' <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> tells <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Clift </PERSON> in `` Suddenly, Last Summer.'' But life knew better than to steal from <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> the Great. The voice <PERSON> Tallulah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bankhead </PERSON> once likened to `` nickels dropping in a slot machine'' has grown tremulous with age. But nothing can daunt that special <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> strength that has seen 80 autumns. <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> remains arrogant, bossy and tenacious, principled, passionate and clever. Her viperish wit slices and dices. No, do n't mess with <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> `` I think I'm very irritating to some people,'' she once said. `` It fascinates me, though, because I'm so sweet really.'' <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> celebrated her 80th birthday Wednesday not quietly at home as some her age would have it, but dashing about <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, visiting ill friends. `` She's being a good Samaritan,'' her secretary, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, said. `` Who cares about my birthday?'' the actress said recently. `` I do n't, as long as I can get around and think straight.'' And she does think, about many things. She frets about the backyard garden of her <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> brownstone, rails at youthful sex, supports abortion and champions euthanasia for the elderly. If it exists, <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> has something to say about it. `` I think there's sort of a terrible fear of death in this country, and I just do n't think you should fear something that is absolutely inevitable,'' she said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've been extremely lucky. I've got money and I can decide to work or not work. I've been terribly lucky all my life.'' <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> had a scare when a growth was discovered last year on her vocal cords. A biopsy showed it was not cancerous, and she recovered nicely from surgery. From the day RKO studio bosses first spotted her on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stage in an abbreviated tunic playing an <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> queen in `` The Warrior's Husband,'' <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> has enchanted and seduced a moviegoing public. Her first movie, `` A Bill of Divorcement,'' with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrymore </PERSON>, was a success. Her next was a dud. The third, the stagey 1933 production `` Morning Glory,'' won her first Academy Award; three others came in 1967, 1968 and 1981 for `` Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' `` The Lion in Winter'' and `` On Golden Pond.'' But after `` Morning Glory,'' <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> made several flops that turned her into box-office poison. `` The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Story'' in 1940 marked her resurrection from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s graveyard with her champagney portrayal of a spoiled rich girl who marries and remarries the man she loves. Playwright <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> wrote it for her and the play was a smash on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. `` I bought the movie rights. They wanted to buy it for all my rivals, but I already owned it. Very clever,'' she said. `` Then I stayed at <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- MGM -RRB- and did all those pictures with <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>. I've done things for the honest reason that I like them. You ca n't do things just to be successful. You have to do things that affect you.'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> was <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>'s closest friend for 27 years. She was linked romantically with billionaire industrialist <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> and producer <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON>, and was married once _ in 1928 to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> socialite <PERSON> Ludlow </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. They divorced in 1934. <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> inherited her Yankee tenacity from her parents. Her father, Dr. <PERSON> Norval </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, was a urologist who campaigned for public awareness about venereal disease. Her mother, <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON>, was a suffragist and a crusader in the birth control movement. Their tenacity, she said, freed her from fear. `` I was n't afraid to pay the price of saying what I thought. I was n't cautious.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Bryn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mawr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> with its high academic standards and mannered students, she survived on her wits. She almost flunked out but buckled down to work so she could act in school plays. After graduating, she plunged into stock and finally landed a bit role in a Broadway flop. Lately, she's done some television work, including last year's `` <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> Slept Here. But mostly, she putters about in her garden, visits friends, spends time in her home on the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> shore and looks for the right movie projects. `` It's terribly difficult to find interesting roles,'' she once said. `` And a poor old thing dying in a rest home is not a terribly interesting picture. I think it's just depressing.''

 Tornadoes and torrential rains hit <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> on Wednesday, killing a 3-year-old boy, damaging dozens of buildings and tossing a mobile home with a woman inside into a fish pond. She suffered slight injuries. In <LOCATION> Pineview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, three houses and at least two mobile homes were damaged when the tornado hit about 5:45 p.m., <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. One of the mobile homes, the home of the 3-year-old, was demolished, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Five other people were injured, including the child's father, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>. West suffered an apparent broken neck and was undergoing tests at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> did not know the child's name. In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans-area </LOCATION> residents cleaned up flooded homes as rain kept falling in the southeastern part of the state. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the latest storm was not expected to cause floods like Tuesday's, when hundreds of homes were swamped and a 2-year-old boy drowned after being swept into a drainage canal in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>. Wednesday's rain knocked out power to about 600 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> homes and businesses, far fewer than the 11,000 affected the previous day, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Tregre </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Entergy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, the morning twisters caused damage only in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and a mile-long stretch <LOCATION> Dothan </LOCATION> in the state's southeast corner, but streets were flooded from Mobile in the west and much of southern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, officials said. No other injuries were reported. Two or three tornadoes destroyed three homes and a restaurant, damaged six businesses and did minor damage to about 40 homes in the <LOCATION> Dothan </LOCATION> area, <ORGANIZATION> Dothan-Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The restaurant's roof and walls blew across the street into a tire store's parking lot, damaging dozens of cars. `` We've found some roofs that were taken seven blocks away and dropped,'' said emergency agency Assistant Director <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. At <ORGANIZATION> Wallace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dothan </LOCATION>, about 2,000 panicky students were ordered to remain inside a building for more than an hour as flood waters inundated the campus because tornado warnings were in effect, said school spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Alford </PERSON>. `` We had some cars floating in the parking lot,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, secretary to the president at the school. Classes were called off for the day. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> public schools were also closed. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> about 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Dothan </LOCATION>, a tornado tossed Mrs. E.C. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' mobile home into a pond with her inside, said a <LOCATION> Samson </LOCATION> police dispatcher who refused to give his name. `` They had to go out in a boat to get her,'' the dispatcher said. Mrs. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, 54, suffered cuts and was hospitalized for observation, he said. In <LOCATION> Malvern </LOCATION> about 10 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Dothan </LOCATION>, thunderstorm winds damaged a house trailer and peanut wagons. Nearly 10 inches of rain fell in <LOCATION> Florala </LOCATION>, 7 inches in <LOCATION> Dothan </LOCATION> and 5.6 inches in Mobile by mid-afternoon, the weather service said. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> area received up to 1.75 inches of rain by noon, far less than Tuesday. Between 6 p.m. Monday and 3 p.m. Tuesday, a deluge of 12.5 inches fell at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kenner </LOCATION>, the weather service said. By Wednesday, flood waters had receded nearly everywhere, except for a 1,000-house subdivision in <LOCATION> Destrehan </LOCATION> nearly 15 miles west of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Officials did not know how many buildings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and the surrounding <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, and St. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> parishes were flooded or how much damage was done. `` It happened so quick and it caught everybody off-guard. We have n't calculated any hard figures,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinna </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. Public and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools were closed Wednesday in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> parishes. Public schools were open in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, but Catholic schools were closed. Some residents were able to get back to their homes and start cleaning up. `` I'm still here mopping up water,'' said <PERSON> Alberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>, who said she had about 2 feet of water in the house Tuesday.

 An exceptional harvest in vineyards across <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has wine growers and wine lovers happily anticipating their first tastings of this year's vintage. There's even talk, perhaps overexcited, that 1989 could produce some of the best wines of the century. The enthusiasm stems from near-perfect growing conditions: a hot, dry summer that meant drought for other farmers, followed by an early harvest free from rain. `` We've got sun in the vats,'' said <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Vigier </PERSON>, a producer of Chateau Reve d'Or, a <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pomerol </LOCATION>, and winner of the Concours Agricole wine competition. `` The quality is very high.'' Hopes are high from <LOCATION> Alsace </LOCATION> in the northeast to <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION> in the southwest, and in all the winegrowing regions in between. `` It's a good year all over <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Amare </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Maison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vigne </ORGANIZATION> et du Vin. Besides the high quality, production is up in quantity by 5 percent over last year, he said. <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> le </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaive </PERSON>, a grower of Puligny-Montrachet and a wine dealer for the Cote d'Or, said the 1989 Burgundy whites will be the best in a decade. `` They are of very, very good quality, at least equal to the good wines of 1978, the acidity is minimal but acceptable. I'd grade the whites 19 out of a perfect 20,'' he said, adding that the region also will have some exceptional red wines But there are reservations as well among wine experts and producers, many of whom are withholding praise until the first corks are popped. `` It may be the year of the decade, because growers and the media want it to be,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurrier </PERSON>, the founder of l'Academie du <PERSON> Vin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and one of the best-known wine connoisseurs in the city. <PERSON> Spurrier </PERSON> said he would wait to see if overripe grapes produce `` a flabby, over-rich product.'' <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, co-owner of <PERSON> Willi </PERSON>'s Wine Bar and Juveniles in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said: `` It was a great year, but people who are hyping the harvest have n't understood the problems of drought. Some of the whites, for example, are lacking freshness and acidity.'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hone </PERSON> of <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Serbet </PERSON>, a wine brokerage firm in <LOCATION> Burgundy </LOCATION>, said the white wines from his region have finesse `` with good intensity of taste.'' `` But these wines may not be as rich and lush as 1986, nor as alcoholic as 1985. For now, the white Burgundies still have a milky quality like grapefruit juice,'' Hone said. `` It's a good year, but too early to say if it's great.'' Hone said <PERSON> Burgundy </PERSON> suffered hailstorms and frost in June and that `` quality varied according to vineyards up and down the Cote d'Or.'' There will be plenty of vintage Champagne as producers there bubble with enthusiasm for a crop that produced 10 percent more wine than usual. `` We've had an exceptional year,'' said <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulon </PERSON>, director of oenology at <ORGANIZATION> Moet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> et </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chandon </ORGANIZATION>. `` The condition of the grapes was perfect; they reached the ideal maturity, were perfectly healthy, giving a balanced product. `` For the final verdict, we have to await February and March, but we're predicting a ` millesime' or vintage year,'' <PERSON> Coulon </PERSON> said. The year's wines may be memorable for their abundance and flavor, but they also will be remembered for being more expensive than ever before. Champaign prices are fixed at 13 percent higher than last year. Some blame rising labor costs or the expense of improved vinification. Often it simply is a question of supply not meeting demand. And sometimes public relations campaigns have as much influence as producers in how a wine is priced. Wines from regions that are `` hyped'' bring as much as the market will bear. `` A lot of speculators in <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION> buy it up even before the secondary fermentation is finished,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Willi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION>, adding that it is too early to judge the 1989 <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION>. Nevertheless, he said, `` Thanks to this year's hype, the price will probably rise.''

<DATELINE>ANDAJES, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Although high in the Andes and far from anything else, this village of communal farmers has not escaped a Maoist guerrillas' terror campaign to disrupt nationwide municipal elections Sunday _ and in the long run the presidential election next year. A column of 30 guerrillas of the Sendero Luminoso -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- movement entered Andajes one stormy night and seized Mayor <PERSON> Heraclio </PERSON> <PERSON> Segundo </PERSON>, four other local officials and a sixth man they accused of cattle rustling. They then dragged them into the village plaza, where they killed them with single gunshots to the back of the neck. As a result, no candidates are running for office Sunday in <LOCATION> Andajes </LOCATION>. `` All that people think about is that they will come back, that there will be more killings,'' said <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernabe </PERSON>, a young farmer. The wave of assassinations of mayors and other local officials in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> has reached levels unprecedented in the Shining Path's 9-year-old insurgency Latest available figures show that 263 mayors' posts around <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> are unfilled, nearly all of them in small towns and villages with little or no police protection. In <LOCATION> Junin </LOCATION> department, in the country's mining and farming heartland 150 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, only 61 of 122 municipalities have mayors. Some 4,500 candidates registered to run in the nation's nearly 2,000 mayoralty races, but an estimated 400 have resigned in fear, and government officials expect many more to withdraw before election day. So far this year the rebels have slain 45 mayors. They also have killed 73 local judges, clerks, councilmen and municipal candidates. In October, 22 local authorities were slain. A total of 330 people died in armed clashes and political violence, one of the highest monthly tolls since the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> launched its insurgency to topple <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s elected government. Shining Path seeks to install a workers' and peasants' state patterned on the ideas of the late Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Political analysts and counterinsurgency experts agree that the rebels' campaign to disrupt the municipal elections is only the first stage of their strategy to block the presidential election in April and provoke a military coup. Shining Path's strategy then most likely would be to place itself in the vanguard of a popular front against a military dictatorship. Publicly, the populist government of President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> has guaranteed that municipal elections will take place throughout <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. But privately a close <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> aide, speaking in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> on condition he not be identified, said, `` The truth is we are not in a position to guarantee the normal course of elections. I wonder how many people are going to be able to vote.'' He said <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> would need 300,000 policemen, not the 75,000 it has, to provide around-the-clock protection to current authorities and all municipal candidates. National election board officials are focusing their efforts on guaranteeing that voting takes place in a normal fashion in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and other major cities, where most of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s population of 21 million is concentrated. A third of the national territory is under states of emergency that suspend constitutional guarantees and give the military broad powers to fight guerrillas. It is in those areas that the elections are most in doubt, but many critics of government policy say the contested regions can not be written off if <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is going to defend its democratic system. Here in <LOCATION> Andajes </LOCATION>, situated on the dome of an 11,000-foot mountain, people feel the government has knowingly let them pass into the Shining Path's domain. Andajes is only 90 miles north of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> in a straight line, but a six-hour ride over bumpy roads that rise from the mist-shrouded desert coast and climb the empty western slopes of the Andes. With its 2,000 inhabitants, its narrow cobblestone lanes and its mud-brick houses, Andajes never received much attention in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. But now the villagers feel totally abandoned. `` The people live with the fear that <PERSON> Sendero </PERSON> will return,'' said village elder <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>. The 16-man police detachment sent to Andajes after its officials were killed withdrew in June to the town of <LOCATION> Churin </LOCATION>, an hour's drive away at the foot of the mountain. `` Most people did not sleep that first night,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiron </PERSON>, a government health worker assigned to <PERSON> Andajes </PERSON>. `` They gathered in small groups and waited for daybreak. They began to realize they would have to accept being alone again.''

 An accident at a government-owned nuclear production plant triggered a release of radioactive hydrogen Wednesday, contaminating four workers and sending the gas into the atmosphere. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neff </PERSON>, manager of environmental health and safety at the Mound Nuclear Production Plant, called the release of tritium minor but said it was the largest such release at the southwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> plant since the 1960s. He said it was 10 times what is normally released at the plant each year. `` It's a relatively small release,'' <PERSON> Neff </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` We do n't believe we had a significant amount that went up.'' The tritium was vented into an exhaust stack and released into the air, taking a projected northwesterly path. <LOCATION> Miamisburg </LOCATION> is about 10 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>. Plant officials initially estimated that in the worst-case scenario, a few dozen residents may have been exposed to 12 millirems of tritium, the equivalent of one chest X-ray. However, plant spokesman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Charbeneau </PERSON> later said an investigation revealed that the maximum off-site dosage was 0.051 millirems. He said a person flying in a plane across the country would be exposed to 3 millirems. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s standard of safe dosage is 25 millirems a year. The plant produces detonators for nuclear weapons and propulsion systems for spacecraft. The accident occurred when a quartz window in a bell jar containing tritium shattered. Workers were evacuated from the building. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, manager of tritium technology and surveillance, said 52 workers were in the area when the accident occurred. He said six of them had contamination on their clothing. Of those six, four were found to have tritium in their system. <PERSON> Neff </PERSON> said half the tritium will pass through a person's body in 12 days. `` It's relatively low-risk, compared to most radioactive material,'' he said. About 2,200 workers are employed at the plant, operated by <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G Mound Applied Technologies for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Hay tainted with parts of rabbits caught in harvesting machinery caused the deaths of at least 15 horses in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, according to veterinarians. Veterinarians investigating the deaths say the rabbits may have been caught in machinery at a farm in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, then shredded and pressed into cubes of hay at a processing plant in suburban Paramount. Toxin secreted by the parts produced a rare strain of botulism known as Clostridium Botulinum, type C, Dr. <PERSON> Hailu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinde </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diagnostic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference at the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairgrounds </LOCATION>. The strain, common in aquatic birds, mink, dogs and cats, last affected horses 10 years ago in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kinde </PERSON> said. The laboratory at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, made the discovery this week while testing hay cubes that were part of a batch consumed by the affected horses, he said. Seven horses died at the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairgrounds </LOCATION> equestrian center, three at a Chino stable, two at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equestrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and veterinarians reported three other cases. In at least 11 of the cases, the horses were fed cubes from Paramount Cubing, investigators said. Nine of 260 horses boarded at stables in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fairgrounds in <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION> have displayed the symptoms since Oct. 28, said trainer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON>. Veterinarians in <LOCATION> Alhambra </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> have reported similar illnesses. <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofmeyer </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubing </ORGANIZATION>, said the company had been told by its attorney not to discuss the matter right away. Feed stores said the sale of hay cubes has fallen sharply in recent days as word about the possibility of the cubes being tainted spread. `` I have n't sold any cubes or pellets in several days,'' said <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Culbertson </PERSON> of the Feed Barn in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>. `` I really got a run of -LRB- baled -RRB- alfalfa on Saturday. Everything is gone.'' Symptoms include quivering legs, low temperature and dull eyes. The animals collapse from weakness and breathing difficulties and usually die or must be destroyed within days.

 Tumbleweeds tossed by 50-mph winds buried houses in this <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town, and residents struggled to dig out of the prickly problem. The mayor warned residents who had tumbleweeds up to their chimneys to clear them to reduce the danger of fire. The weeds had grown thick all summer along the banks of the drought-shrunken <ORGANIZATION> Oahe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservoir </ORGANIZATION> in north-central <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Winds out of the west Tuesday evening sent the weeds rolling across the prairie. `` People in the west end of town as they were sitting in their homes ... heard what sounded like rocks being thrown against their houses,'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. `` They came out this morning to find out that a number of houses were buried, literally buried, with tumbleweeds. We had some homes with only the roof sticking out. `` We had people that could not get out of their driveways,'' <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON> said. `` We had streets that were blocked, literally invaded by tumbleweeds.'' Mayor <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> urged residents to help clean up the mess. City crews cleared the brush from the streets so vehicles could pass. The cleanup was continuing today. `` It's developing into what could be a very dangerous situation,'' <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> said. `` We need to use extreme caution. I'd like to tell people not to drive through those tumbleweeds Those that have homes that are covered up to their chimneys, get those weeds cleared so they do n't start a fire.'' <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> said he had asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, which manages the reservoir system, to help in the cleanup. `` I personally feel they have a responsibility for those weeds,'' he said. `` They have done nothing to control the weeds. They're 6 feet tall down there. We're going to have this problem every time we have a west wind. I had advised them previously that they had large weeds down there, and I was worried about what was going to happen.'' Phone calls by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to the corps went unanswered late Wednesday. <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON> said removing the tumbleweeds will be difficult. `` Nobody knows for sure what to do with them,'' he said. `` You ca n't crush them. All you can really do is move them around.'' He said the corps planned to conduct a controlled burn to remove some of the remaining weeds. `` It was the strangest thing I've ever seen,'' <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON> said. `` We've been buried with snow before up in this area, but this is the first time anybody can remember being buried with tumbleweeds.''

 <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s apparent victory in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> governor's race is a watershed in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political history, in which black politicians have had but a shadowy presence <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> would be the nation's first elected black governor, but would not be the first black American to serve as governor. That distinction belongs to <PERSON> Pinckney </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON>, who became governor of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> following the impeachment of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Warmoth </PERSON> in 1872. He served for 43 days until the newly elected <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> was sworn in. Although any number of candidates could have been drawn from the small, black middle class that had existed in the nation since its founding, a black was not elected to office until 1855, when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> <PERSON> Langston </PERSON> was elected clerk of <LOCATION> Brownhelm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The first blacks ever elected to a legislative body were <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, son of abolitionist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who won seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> in 1866. Most of the nation's first black elected officials won their positions during Reconstruction _ the post-Civil War period in which Southern states were reorganized so they could rejoin the Union. Blacks were allowed to vote for the first time and seek elected office. It was a time when <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> became mayor of <LOCATION> Natchez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> became the first black in the House of Representatives. <PERSON> Hiram </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Revels </PERSON>, a minister, succeeded <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> on Feb. 25, 1870, thus becoming first black in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Blanche </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, also from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, was the first black to serve a full term in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON>, the son of a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> planter and a black woman, had been a captain in the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Following the Civil War, he settled in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and joined the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which largely consisted of newly franchised blacks and sympathetic and liberal whites. A shrewd and ambitious man, he was elected to the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1868 and was named president pro tempore. When <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, a former slave and the nation's first black lieutenant governor, died, <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON> moved to the No. 2 spot through constitutional succession. There were other black lieutenant governors during Reconstruction in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. But none was ever elected governor. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, too, served as a lieutenant governor in a Southern state. But in <LOCATION> Virigina </LOCATION> at the end of the 20th century, he is part of the political mainstream. <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON> was something of a pariah. Even as an elected official, he and his family faced racism. His children had to be escorted to high school to protect them from mobs of bigoted white youths. And because of his elegance, intelligence and ambition, white politicians considered him dangerous. His attempt to run for governor was thwarted because whites controlled the election machinery and blacks were divided. He instead ran for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and was elected. He also ran for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and was elected in 1873. But after three years of debate, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> refused to seat him. `` I demand simple justice,'' <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do not care so far as I am personally concerned whether you give me my seat or not. I will go back to my people and come here again; but I tell you to preserve your own consistency. Do not make fish of me while you make flesh of everybody else.'' <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON>'s case drew attention from the national press. Said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Commercial Advertiser: `` Pinchback's presence in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is not open to the smallest objection, except the old Bourbon war-whoops of color. `` Mr. <PERSON> Pinchback </PERSON> is the best dressed Southern man we have had in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from the South since the days when gentlemen were Democrats.''

<HEAD>Minimum Wage Increase Clears Congress; Bush to Sign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Only President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promised signature is needed for the first minimum wage increase in nearly a decade, following <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' lopsided approval of a bill raising the rate to $ 4.25 by April 1991. The measure _ which includes a subminimum wage for teen-agers new to the job market _ cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on an 89-8 vote Wednesday, exactly a week after it passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by an equally overwhelming vote of 382-37. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who struck the compromise plan with congressional Democrats last week, is expected to sign the bill before Thanksgiving, perhaps as early as next week. `` The nine-year logjam on the minimum wage is finally broken,'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote `` The working poor are about to receive an increase, although it is not as much as they deserve.'' Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, speaking for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, said `` the 3 million American workers currently on the minimum wage will benefit.'' But she said skills training was the best way to help the working poor and urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to move ahead with legislation dealing with that issue. `` The minimum wage is not the pulley to pull people out of poverty,'' she said. The compromise plan will push the minimum wage, $ 3.35 an hour since January 1981, to $ 3.80 on April 1 and to $ 4.25 a year later. At the same time, it will create a new, lower wage for 16 - to 19-year-old workers who are new to the job market Democrats and organized labor long have opposed such a subminimum `` training wage'' but were forced to concede that point to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to strike the deal. In return, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agreed to have the minimum wage reach $ 4.25 nine months earlier than he had proposed and also accepted a far more restrictive training wage than he sought earlier this year. Labor played down its concessions in calling on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to quickly sign the measure into law. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poorest workers have gone nearly a decade without a raise and this long-overdue step will give them a chance to lift themselves and their families out of poverty,'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. Even as they praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for agreeing to the compromise, <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> said they would seek another increase heading into the 1992 presidential elections, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> likely will be seeking a second term. Both sides made significant concessions to reach the compromise four months after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed an earlier Democratic minimum-wage plan. In addition to agreeing to a subminimum, Democrats and labor scaled back their final minimum-wage target; the measure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed called for an increase to $ 4.55 an hour. The <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, under increasing pressure from <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers seeking to avoid another veto battle heading into 1990 elections year, agreed to a timetable reaching the $ 4.25 level nine months before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had proposed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also accepted a training wage that can only be paid to workers 16 to 19 years old for their first three months of work experience and for another three months if certified training is provided. The provision allowing the subminimum expires in April 1993. Under the plan, the subminimum wage will be $ 3.35 on April 1 and $ 3.61 a year later. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to allow the lower wage to be paid to all workers, regardless of age, for their first six months on any new job, regardless of past work experience. All eight senators voting against the measure were Republicans. They were Sens. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Weak S&amp;Ls Should Find Merger Partner or Face Regulatory Action</HEAD>

 Thrift regulator <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> is issuing a warning to weak savings and loan institutions: Find a merger partner or face regulatory action. `` Thrifts that are undercapitalized are in very grave jeopardy,'' Wall told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday in closing its annual convention. His agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, estimates that 800 of the nation's 2,600 solvent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls will fall nearly $ 20 billion short of new, more stringent capital standards taking effect Dec. 7. The agency believes 223 of the 800 are practically hopeless and within a year will join 260 failed institutions already under government control. Another segment of the 800 will meet the new standard and stay independent by retaining earnings or selling assets, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. But, about 300 will stay out of the government's hands only by seeking a private merger partner. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said his agency stands ready to help by finding suitors, including foreign firms and commercial banks, starting with a special conference next week. `` We are calling this our ` arranged marriage' program,'' he said. The new rules require S & amp; L owners to back their lending with more of their own capital and are designed to provide a larger buffer of private money between S & amp; L losses and government deposit insurance funds. They are considered the cornerstone reform in <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout legislation enacted Aug. 9. Wall warned weak thrifts not to be too choosy about merger offers, adding, `` We will not hesitate to take regulatory action.'' `` Go with what you've got ... not with the would have and could have'' or it will be too late to find a merger partner, he said. Under the bailout bill, thrifts not meeting capital standards by the end of 1994 face closure and Wall's agency is writing rules that would permit it to seize an undercapitalized thrift early, before its owners' investment is exhausted. One S & amp; L executive, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Magnolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hattiesburg </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, said some of his colleagues at weaker thrifts have n't yet admitted they ca n't survive alone. `` There are a great number of people out there who are unwilling to face it. ... But it's going to be difficult to face the siren call of merger with a commercial bank,'' he said. Wall cited recent interest by Canadian and Japanese companies as evidence of the thrift industry's positive outlook. `` The worst is really over. We have been through the fire and emerged tempered by the experience,'' he said. In his speech, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> did not mention the controversy swirling around his agency's handling of the failure of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, expected to cost taxpayers up to $ 2 billion. However, at a news conference, he defended his decision to delay seizure of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> by nearly two years, saying he was legally required to keep it open unless it was insolvent. The staff of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> disputes that assertion, maintaining that Wall need only have determined that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was operating unsafely and dissipating its assets. `` We were advised at the time we did not have the -LRB- legal -RRB- basis -LRB- to seize <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> -RRB-. It was the best advice we could find,'' he said.

 Outrage over the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill helped lead to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s vote to let the states continue setting unlimited liability for oil spill cleanups, environmentalists say. But the oil industry says the measure approved Wednesday could do more harm than good to the environment and raise consumer fuel costs. `` It was clear that the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> was such a national insult to the environment that all the lobbying by the oil companies and special interests could n't overcome it,'' said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Matz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> said the spill demonstrated `` there were some serious deficiencies in the bill'' as it was originally written <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., successfully inserted an amendment into a massive oil liability bill that allowed stricter state laws, despite strong oil industry opposition and several attempts on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor to soften the measure The measure would track current law which also allows states to set stricter liability limits. The House was scheduled to vote on the entire bill today, but the key vote was on the Miller-Studds amendment, which passed 279-143. `` We are dismayed and distressed that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has taken this gigantic step backward in environmental protection,'' said a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> after the vote. `` Unless altered by conference committee action, we must strongly urge that the president veto this legislation,'' the industry lobbying organization said. The group said that allowing states to go beyond federal limits on the amount a company should spend for oil spill cleanup will make insurance costs for hauling oil prohibitive. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s plan is adopted into law, many responsible transporters of oil will likely be driven out of business and replaced by less financially responsible and capable shippers,'' said the institute. `` Operators involved in transportation of petroleum products may feel it's not worth the legal risks,'' Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said during debate on the amendment. `` Home heating oil may suddenly disappear.'' A $ 2 billion price tag has been put on the Exxon Valdez cleanup in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. That state sets no limits on companies' liability for repairing environmental damage. The House bill would limit oil companies' liability to $ 1,200 per gross ton, with a minimum of $ 10 million for large tankers and $ 2 million for small tankers. However, it would let states set higher limits. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has passed similar legislation. Twenty-eight states now have their own oil spill liability statutes, and 19 of them require unlimited liability. <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> accused the oil industry of using scare tactics. `` Make no mistake,'' <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> said. `` When it comes to state pre-emption and the oil industry, the battle lines are clearly drawn between those who are hurt by oil spills and those who cause them, between the public interest and a narrow private interest, between the average citizen and big oil.'' Environmentalists were surprised at the size of the vote in their favor, especially on a second <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> amendment that makes an oil company or carrier liable for unlimited damages in cases of simple negligence, rather than gross negligence as the original measure required. That amendment, which had been expected to be defeated, passed 213 to 207. `` What it means is that the high-priced lobbyists that the oil companies brought in do n't always do the trick,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehrkens </PERSON> of the Wilderness Society. The House for 14 years has repeatedly passed bills against allowing states to pre-empt the federal law.

<HEAD>Abortion Opponents Blame Own Candidates for `Waffling'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Abortion opponents, acknowledging the issue helped Democrats win this week's elections, blame their own candidates for wavering in their anti-abortion positions _ but defections already are beginning. `` The lesson that will be learned,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Steen </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, `` is that pro-life candidates can not waffle and pro-life candidates must run as aggressively on this issue as pro-abortion candidates.'' An issue that once had Democrats on the run, abortion emerged as a decisive factor in Democratic victories following a political turnabout that Republicans could n't foresee just a few months ago. Republican National Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> conceded the issue `` made a difference'' in Tuesday's elections. `` I think the abortion issue helped me considerably,'' Democrat <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said after claiming victory in his bid to become governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> against anti-abortion Republican <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, a leader of the pro-choice minority in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> faces losses next year if it sticks to the anti-abortion position in its platform. `` I would hope that some of these elections yesterday might bring us to our senses and we would understand that the public is not on our side on this issue,'' he said after a meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the election results. Some Republicans already are signing up on the pro-choice side. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, GOP gubernatorial candidate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and a number of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state legislators joined Democrats in signing a petition Wednesday seeking a state constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to abortion. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> predicted differences over abortion could decide the primary race against his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rival, state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Steen </PERSON> said Republican losers <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> governor's race, and <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mayoral race, sealed their defeats weeks ahead by giving ground in their opposition to abortion. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had abandoned both before the election, he said. `` They flip-flopped because they were scared,'' said <PERSON> O'Steen </PERSON>. The anti-abortion group blamed <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s strategists for failing to aggressively defend against <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s ads attacking him on the abortion issue, and failing to forcefully push his anti-abortion views in ads of his own. `` This is not a loss for the pro-life movement; it is a loss for <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> and the way he handled it,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Faucher </PERSON>, director of the Right to <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION>'s political action committee. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> refused to concede after the unofficial final vote count showed him trailing <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> by about 5,500 votes out of the nearly 1.8 million cast. Abortion rights activists claimed partial credit for the election of Democrat <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Both the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> races also were caught up in the potent and sometimes unspoken political crosscurrents of race. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> are black and, while winning electoral majorities, ran well behind what polling had indicated. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said there was `` no question'' that <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> would not have won without the abortion issue. She said <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>'s candidacy never got off the ground because of his anti-abortion position, and that his attempts to soften his opposition further hurt him. `` Voters yesterday proved that choice is a winning issue in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said. `` To politicians everywhere we say with conviction: if you're out of touch with the pro-choice majority, you're out of office. `` If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and members of his party remain beholden to the anti-choice minority, they will pay a tremendous price at the polls,'' she said. Political analysts said the apparent turnaround on abortion was the direct result of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision in July in the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> case. In it, the court gave states broader discretion in regulating abortion and created the impression that major reversals of abortion rights were possible. The court's action invigorated supporters of abortion rights and created an opportunity for pro-choice candidates to exploit concern about a retreat in abortion rights.

<HEAD>Six Executed For Rioting in Chengdu Following June 4 Crackdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Six people have been executed in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> for participating in riots in June when the government crushed the pro-democracy movement, a local official said today. The executions brought to at least 18 the number of people put to death following the military crackdown on demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other cities. Two people already had been reported executed in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> for roles in three days of rioting that began June 4, when troops killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and police in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> tried to break up a student sit-in. An estimated 30 people died in the <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> violence, and an entire city block, including a large department store, was burned down. It was the worst outbreak of violence in any city outside <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The six in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> were sentenced to death at a public rally Tuesday and immediately executed, said an official of <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>'s Foreign Affairs Office Three were charged with `` beating, smashing, looting and burning'' during the violence. The other three were charged with theft and murder. At least 12 other people have been put to death for direct involvement in anti-government demonstrations and riots throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last spring. None of the previous 12 were students, and it was not clear whether there were any students among the six executed in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> this week. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s press rarely reports arrests or court cases involving the student-led pro-democracy movement. Reports that student leaders and soldiers who refused to cooperate in the military crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have been executed can not be confirmed. Executions in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are usually by a bullet to the back of the head as the person sentenced kneels on the ground.

 Shortline railroads, bus service, feeder airlines and maybe a ferry or two could be possible under long-range strategy mapped out in an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report on rural transportation. But massive new federal aid to help finance such ventures? None was mentioned in the report. Cooperation at all public and private levels was urged as the key to transportation development. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> `` Buzz'' <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, head of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, which issued the report Wednesday, said the findings and recommendations were based on regional meetings going back two years and a national conference in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, in Aug. 1988 `` From the very beginning, this initiative has been a cooperative activity involving a wide range of public and private agencies seeking solutions to the transportation problems of rural residents,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> added the report will give rural transportation organizations a practical guide to help in planning and policy development at national, state and local levels. Although no specific mode was recommended over another, the report referred to `` passenger transportation'' generically, meaning it could include rail, bus or air travel, depending on the circumstances. The report said cooperation between public and private sectors `` is essential if rural passenger transportation is to meet the mobility needs of rural residents'' and that new approaches must be found. In mobilizing support for rural passenger transportation, the report said a national plan for rural communities to maintain and expand passenger transportation should be a top priority for action. `` Communities are an essential source of financial and volunteer support for rural passenger transportation providers,'' the report said. `` Effective community participation can generate support for continued intercity bus service and provide financial and volunteer support for rural public providers.'' The report said rural passenger needs are so diverse that a single source of funding can not be relied upon. `` Funding needs to be a joint federal, state and local government effort in conjunction with private industry,'' it said. `` Utilizing a broad range of funding sources and allowing greater flexibility in mixing available funding can provide more mobility to more rural residents.'' Copies of the report, `` Reconnecting Rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: Recommendations for a National Strategy,'' are available from: USDA-OT, P.O. Box 96575, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> 20090-6575. For more information call 202?653-6305.

 Total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vegetable output this year is up from the drought-reduced 1988 production, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said. The overall increase is due mostly to a 29 percent boost in processing vegetable tonnage and a 3 percent larger potato harvest. Production of processing vegetables is estimated at nearly 15 million tons, while potato output is estimated at around 370 million hundredweight. The output of fresh vegetables in 1989 is expected to be up 1 percent; mushrooms, 14 percent; sweet potatoes, 7 percent; and dry edible beans, 29 percent. Despite the strong increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vegetable production, the value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vegetable imports is expected to be up by about 5 percent to a record level, the report said Wednesday. `` Growth in imports during 1989 stemmed from continued strong prices at the wholesale and retail levels, and continued strong consumer demand,'' the report said. `` Most of the imports are fresh vegetables, which are brought in during the winter months when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production is limited to the southern-tier states.'' Per capita use of total vegetables rose to an estimated 336 pounds in 1988, up one pound despite drought-reduced domestic supplies. In general, increases in fresh vegetables, potatoes and mushrooms offset declines among processed items. Fresh vegetable use reached 100 pounds per capita for the first time because of larger use of lettuce and onions, the report said. `` Potato use rose from 49 pounds in 1987 to 55 pounds in 1988. This gain can be attributed entirely to large carryover stocks of fresh potatoes,'' the report said. `` Use of frozen potatoes dropped 4 percent to 44 pounds as record exports reduced the domestic supply.''

<HEAD>Study Shows a President's Choice of Judges Keep Alive His Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A comparison of the voting records in environment cases of judges appointed by Presidents <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> supports the theory that a president's most lasting impact may result from his judicial selections. Law professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovacic </PERSON> said his findings may be especially significant if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chooses judges of the same cast of mind as those appointed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In eight years, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> named 347, or 47 percent, of the nation's active federal judges, who serve life terms. By the end of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s term in 1992, <PERSON> Kovacic </PERSON> noted, `` Reagan-Bush nominees could account for as many as 75 percent of all federal Court of Appeals judges.'' When Reagan-Bush judges constitute that big a majority, <PERSON> Kovacic </PERSON> noted, they `` might be inclined over time to endorse more extreme positions in writing majority opinions'' because they wo n't feel compelled to achieve consensus with more moderate judges. In a telephone interview Wednesday, <PERSON> Kovacic </PERSON> said everyone knows about the impact of a president's choices for <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> vacancies, `` but the same kind of effects, though not quite so dramatic, can result from whom he picks for the district and circuit courts.'' `` Of all the tools at a president's disposal, this is an important one,'' he said. `` If you want to make your policies outlive your administration, this is one of the most important means for doing that.'' <PERSON> Kovacic </PERSON>'s analysis was published by the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative research organization. <PERSON> Kovacic </PERSON> teaches at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. He studied how appeals court judges voted on environmental cases arising from enactment of the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Clean Water Acts. In 162 cases in which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> appointees cast 254 votes, he found that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s judges voted 54 percent of the time to increase the regulatory burden on those whose pollution emission or discharge activities were under consideration. Judges appointed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> voted that way 43 percent of the time. On the <ORGANIZATION> key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, often called the country's second most important court, the differences were sharper. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> appointees voted 48 percent of the time to increase the pollution-fighting burden of parties before the court while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> judges voted that way only half as often. `` The results are not entirely clear-cut,'' <PERSON> Kovacic </PERSON> concluded, noting that when <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> judges sat on the same panel they rarely disagreed. `` It nonetheless appears that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointments on the whole succeeded in bringing less intervention-minded judges to the courts of appeals.'' The tendencies of judges are particularly important, <PERSON> Kovacic </PERSON> said, in regulatory issues where <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> often gives an administrative body, like the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, broad authority to implement comparatively general statutes and the courts find themselves overseeing their work. Other studies have reached the same conclusion about the long-term impact of judicial selections. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, wrote last summer that the real impact of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appointments will reach into the 21st century and likely will be reinforced by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judges. `` For civil libertarians this means that when the country celebrates the bicentennial of the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1991, the courts will be dominated by those hostile to a liberal reading of those rights,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> wrote. `` For judicial conservatives, this means a healthy return to government by the elected representatives of the people.'' <PERSON> Kovacic </PERSON> noted speculation that substantial numbers of Reagan-appointed judges, younger than average and often with college-age children, may quit the bench for the higher earning potential of law practice, especially if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't raise judges' salaries. `` The real test of whether the Reagan-Bush appointments will have long-lasting effects depends on whether the people they have selected will remain in those jobs,'' he said.

 Facing a Jan. 1 deadline, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is planning to carry out a key personnel change required by the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties without violating its policy of avoiding contact with the Panamanian government, officials say. The treaties say that as of the new year, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government commission which runs the canal must be headed by a Panamanian for the first time in the 75-year history of the waterway. They also specify the Panamanian government must nominate the administrator and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president appoint him, subject to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. But the administration has refused to consider the nominee of the Panamanian government, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>. He was the official presidential candidate in the May elections that were annulled by Panamanian authorities amid widespread allegations of fraud. The administration, while promising to abide by the treaties, has made it clear that it wo n't consider any nominee proposed by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on grounds that the country has no legitimate government. The administration does n't recognize <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, the handpicked crony of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> who was sworn in as unelected president Sept. 1. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the dilemma is expected to be resolved by allowing the deputy administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Manfredo </PERSON>, to take charge Jan. 1. As the officials see it, the ploy does not follow the letter of the treaties but complies with the spirit in that <PERSON> Manfredo </PERSON>'s accession ensures that management of the canal will be in the hands of a Panamanian In effect, the post of administrator would be unfilled and <PERSON> Manfredo </PERSON> would serve as acting chief until an elected government takes office in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The administration plan was first disclosed in a <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> column by <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. Administration, congressional and diplomatic sources, all insisting on anonymity, gave <PERSON> Manfredo </PERSON> high marks for his performance in his 10 years as deputy administrator. `` His ability to run the canal is unquestioned,'' said one congressional source. What is not clear is whether <PERSON> Manfredo </PERSON> will go along with a plan that not only departs from the letter of the treaties but that also could leave him open to charges by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of acquiescing in an anti-Panamanian gambit. Administration and congressional sources said <PERSON> Manfredo </PERSON> has been approached about taking over as acting administrator but has not responded. He is a former commerce minister under the late Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> and is said to harbor anti-Noriega sentiments. The current administrator of the canal commission is <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, a former commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> who has held his present job for 10 years. He will step down by Jan. 1, consistent with the treaties, and an American will be appointed to the deputy administrator's post. The transfer of power to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will be completed at the end of the century, when <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> assumes full control of the canal. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, has said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign against him is part of a plot to evade compliance with the canal treaties.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> is refusing to pay $ 10,000 in previously promised support for a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> gallery's AIDS art show on the ground that it might violate a new federal anti-obscenity law. Artists Space, the private <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> arts institution that is sponsoring the exhibition, notified <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> on Wednesday that its 23-member board had unanimously rejected his request to relinquish the tax-paid grant. In response, <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> said the endowment will withhold the $ 10,000 in grant money pending a legal opinion from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have n't paid out the funds, and we do n't intend to do so,'' <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He also moved to disassociate the NEA from the AIDS show. In a Nov. 3 letter to <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> asked the gallery to publish this disclaimer: `` The National Endowment for the Arts has not supported this exhibition or its catalog.'' Ms. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said the gallery board was `` taking a stand against censorship and self-censorship'' in refusing to relinquish the grant. `` All of the works in the show are valid artworks,'' she said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We believe this is a show that should be funded by the endowment.'' The gallery's application for an endowment grant for the $ 30,000 show was approved in May by the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>, which notified the gallery of the award in July. That was before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the anti-obscenity law last month at the urging of Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, R-N.C. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and other congressional conservatives had protested two previous endowment grants totaling $ 45,000 for exhibitions of controversial art by photographer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> and artist <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>. In response to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> gallery's decision, <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the $ 10,000 grant would be withheld because a review of the exhibition catalog made clear that `` the nature of the show had changed from an artistic focus to a political focus.'' Ms. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> denied the charge. `` This is not a show about politics,'' she said. `` It's a show about AIDS.'' The $ 30,000 show, which is scheduled to open at Artists Space on Nov. 16, features works by 23 painters, sculptors and photographers that attempt to portray the effects of AIDS on the artistic community. Ms. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said the show includes a few images of male and female nudity and `` deals with sexuality in the context of AIDS,'' although that is not the primary emphasis. `` Some of it might be homoerotic, but I do n't know,'' she said. The new law forbids federal support for works that `` may be considered obscene'' by the chairman of the endowment, an independent federal agency that spent $ 156 million in tax funds last year in the form of matching grants to 4,600 artists and arts institutions. <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> said he primarily objected to portions of the show's catalog which he said contained `` very hostile, angry and accusatory'' statements and `` very politically pointed commentary'' about <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and other critics of controversial art and the AIDS cause In his letter to Ms. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> said that `` given our recent review, and the current political climate, I believe that the use of endowment funds to exhibit or publish this work is in violation of the spirit of the congressional directive.'' He said that `` certain texts, photographs and other representations in the exhibition may offend the language'' of the new law. `` Because of the recent criticism the endowment has come under and the seriousness of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' directive, we must all work together to ensure that projects funded by the endowment do not violate either the spirit or the letter of the law,'' <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> wrote. `` The message has been clearly and strongly conveyed to us that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> means business.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, awaiting sentencing on his guilty plea to an Iran-Contra charge, promises to cooperate with the prosecution of other defendants such as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and agreed to `` cooperate fully'' with prosecutors in later cases in exchange for a government promise to seek dismissal of 11 other criminal charges against him. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, whose criminal trial is to begin Jan. 22, is accused of conspiracy, two counts of obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and two counts of making false statements. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> has not yet spoken with government prosecutors and it `` remains to be seen'' what information he has to offer, said prosecutor <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> case was to have gone to trial on Monday. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, the Iran-Contra middleman enlisted by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, admitted to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> that he made a false statement on June 10, 1987, when he denied to congressional investigators that he gave anything of benefit to North. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> has said he `` met with Gen. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, I guess, my whole time in the White House maybe three or four times.'' One of those times was in January 1986, when <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> said the two discussed <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s role in assisting upcoming arms shipments to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Just two months earlier, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> had been involved at North's request in the CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk missiles from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> The presidential finding legalizing the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in the shipment was written after the <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> were transported. It is unclear whether <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> discussed the previous shipments in January. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, the former national security adviser, is accused of lying by telling members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in a closed meeting that he did n't learn until January 1986 that the November 1985 shipment contained <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION>. North had sent <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> a status report on the November 1985 shipment just before it took place. Regarding assisting the Contras, `` I was aware that <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> was going to essentially set up and run a private logistics organization,'' <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> 2 -LCB- years ago. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> said he knew that overcharges on the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` would go into one of the accounts that Gen. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> had that he would then use to purchase arms to support'' the Contras. But <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> said that when he met with <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> it was for `` mainly what I would categorize as hand-holding. ... Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON> was always telling me that he thought <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> was losing money.'' <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> paid the bill in 1986 for a security system at North's home, $ 7,000 in cash and $ 9,000 drawn on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank from profits of `` the Enterprise,'' the maze of companies and secret Swiss bank accounts <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and his business partner <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> used in the Iran-Contra affair <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> is charged with two counts involving gratuities that were to be paid to <PERSON> North </PERSON> as well as alleged conspiracy, government theft and wire fraud. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> could face up to five years in prison on the false statement plea. The judge, who asked both sides for court filings on whether maximum fines applicable under the law are $ 10,000 or $ 250,000, set no date for sentencing. To date, four people including <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> have pleaded guilty to various crimes in the Iran-Contra affair. North is appealing his jury conviction of three felonies and trials are pending for <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s business partner <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>.

<HEAD>House Moving to Legitimize Intelligence Briefings to Speaker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After technically violating its own rules for years, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is moving to give its speaker full access to the nation's most sensitive secrets in files and hearings of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Under House rules, no classified information can be given to anyone who is not a member of the intelligence panel without a vote of the committee and without a record being kept of the information and to whom it is given. But over the years, speakers of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ who are not members of the committee _ have apparently been given informal briefings on government secrets, said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the committee. `` Of course, because those rules were not adhered to, few members of the committee were aware of some of these instances, and perhaps no one knows how many times this has occurred,'' <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said in testimony Tuesday before the Rules Committee. The Rules panel moved to change the rules and give <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., and his successors blanket access to the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s business The matter is expected to come before the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> next week. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said he favors the rules change, which has been proposed by committee Chairman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilenson </PERSON>, D-Calif. The issue was given prominence last year when former Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, disclosed to reporters that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had sought to foment civil unrest in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to undermine the political stability of the leftist Sandinista government. Sources later said that the information had come to the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and had been relayed to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> through an informal briefing. The matter has arisen again in connection with the publication of a new book on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, `` The Ambition and the Power,'' by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> writer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, which is due in bookstores this month. The book refers to a Nicaraguan political assessment of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, intercepted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence and disclosed to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The book asserts that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> learned of the document in a briefing from Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, then the chairman of the intelligence panel. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> mentioned the passage from the book when he testified before the <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and argued for additional changes to toughen security. His suggestions included shrinking the committee from its current 19 members to 13, requiring members and staff to take a secrecy oath, and requiring both members and staff to undergo security clearances. All of <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>'s suggested changes were rejected by the panel, mostly along party lines. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, who took an active interest in intelligence matters when he was a member of the panel as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, ran into problems when he sought to continue his contacts with the committee after he succeeded <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as speaker earlier this year. Republican members objected that a <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> staff member, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, was being given full access to intelligence information and feared it would lead to other requests for access outside of House rules. `` I think the speaker has a constitutional right to any information that is in the possession of any member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or any committee of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said Tuesday. He said he believed when he was a member of the panel that it was his obligation to provide <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with any information he requested. `` If there is any member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who should be fully informed on matters within the purview of the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, it is the speaker, first,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>EPA Says 36 Urban Areas Violate Clean Air Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The governors of 16 states are being told to tighten state air quality requirements and bring 36 urban areas into compliance with federal clean air standards. The directive stems from findings earlier this year that revealed the 36 areas were in violation of federal air quality standards, bringing the number of such areas exceeding the standards to 102. Under the federal Clean Air Act, states are responsible for developing air quality plans so that urban areas meet federal ozone and carbon monoxide pollution standards. The list of urban areas found in violation were released last July. In a letter to the 16 governors the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the states would have one year to develop a first phase improved air quality compliance plan. This could include tighter enforcement of existing state pollution control regulations and the adoption of additional regulations already planned but not yet put into effect, said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. The Agency noted these actions should be pursued despite an expectation that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will soon enact a new federal clean air law that likely will impose stiffer pollution control requirements. The 16 states contacted, with urban areas non in compliance in parenthesis, were: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Albany-Schenectady-Troy </LOCATION> area, <LOCATION> Buffalo-Niagara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -RRB-; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>, Erie, <LOCATION> Harrisburg-Lebanon-Carlisle </LOCATION> area, <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, Reading, <PERSON> Scranton-Wilkes </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> area, <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> -RRB-; <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> -LRB- Bowling Green, <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION> -RRB-; <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, Dayton-Springfield, <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, Youngstown-Warren -RRB-; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greenbriar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -RRB-; <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend-Mishawaka-Elkhart </LOCATION> area, <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION> -RRB-; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Greensboro-Winston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem-High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> area, <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION> -RRB-; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Greenville-Spartanburg </LOCATION> -RRB- <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> -RRB- <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> -RRB-; <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Lewiston-Auburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Waldo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -RRB-; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> -RRB-; <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Sussex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -RRB-; <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> -RRB-; <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Winnebago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -RRB-; <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Klamath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -RRB-.

 The spirit of glasnost, which prompted plans for a Miss Soviet-American pageant and exchange program, has <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> squaring off. <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> leaders said Wednesday they're wooing pageant organizers, who feel snubbed by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> because it never responded to their request to become a sister-city with <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> and be host of the pageant. `` The organizers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are very interested in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> because it's an All-American city,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloof </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> officials acknowledged they fumbled arrangements for the pageant.

 The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen Thursday, while the key barometer on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> recovered from its early setback and rose. The dollar closed at 142.70 yen, down 0.27 yen from Wednesday's close of 142.97 yen It started trading higher at 143.33 yen and ranged between 142.67 yen and 143.33 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell slightly during morning trading, made up its losses and gained 61.83 points, or 0.17 percent, finishing the day at 35,657.42.

<HEAD>Congress Split Over Use of Vouchers for Child Care Aid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new debate over the use of vouchers for children's programs is ensnarling a last-ditch effort by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators to salvage a child care bill before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns this year. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, insisted Wednesday that states be allowed to issue vouchers to parents for both a new preschool education program and new before - and after-school care services that would be established in the legislation <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, who has encountered wrath from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and conservative groups for joining with liberals on child care standards, also wants governors to have more discretion on how the new money is spent. `` This is it for child care,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators. `` If we ca n't put this together, then it's going to go down the drain.'' The vouchers, which are supported by the administration, would effectively allow a portion of the new aid to flow through parents to churches and parochial schools which provide child care services. Most liberal Democrats, with support from unionized teachers and other public employees, want the money to instead go directly to care providers. They succeeded in getting a large portion of the funds in both <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> versions devoted to making public schools become day care centers for so-called `` latchkey'' children of working parents. Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., an adamant opponent of vouchers, reluctantly agreed to allow a limited use of them in subsidizing only day care services for pre-kindergarten children and `` no one else. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have approved separate measures to double the $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion now spent annually on direct subsidies for child care services. They also would provide $ 11 billion to $ 13.5 billion in new tax credits over the next five years to low-income families with children and require states to regulate care providers. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version would give governors much more discretion than the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure on how the new direct aid is spent. It would also allow them to dedicate a portion of the funds for issuing vouchers that parents could use to pay the care provider of their choice. The House version has no provision for vouchers. But upon passing the bill last month, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders instructed their negotiators to accept a limited use of them.

 Perhaps the biggest splash of the royal visit to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has been the exclusive photos of Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> swimming at a British naval base pool that fetched $ 40,000 in a frenzied Fleet Street bidding war. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tabloid <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> paid about 25,000 British pounds -LRB- $ 39,750 -RRB- for the series of pictures, outbidding about nine rivals, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hung </PERSON>, group general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Sing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>, said today. British reporters flooded the newspaper's offices after the pictures appeared in the Wednesday edition of the Sing <PERSON> Tao </PERSON> <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pao </PERSON>, a Chinese-language afternoon newspaper. `` It was crazy,'' said Hung. `` It was a madhouse.'' A photographer for the local Chinese-language newspaper positioned atop an adjacent hotel had snapped the pictures early Wednesday. The photographs showed the princess, wearing a red one-piece bathing suit, diving into the pool and swimming backstroke. Another shot showed her walking barefoot outside the pool with a white towel wrapped around her body. A picture of <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> swimming backstroke covered nearly the entire front page of today's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> under the headline `` Di in Peril.'' The newspaper claimed that the ability of the photographer to take such pictures showed `` gaping holes'' in her security.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said today that Nicaraguan troops have summarily executed dozens of unarmed peasants during operations against the Contras while abuses by the U.S.-backed rebels against civilians have dropped. The international human rights group said in a report that the Sandinista government has imprisoned some soldiers for unlawful killings of civilians; pledged to investigate other such killings; improved legal protection for detainees; and freed more than 2,000 political prisoners since 1986. It also said, however, that since an April 1988 cease-fire there has been no sign of a decline in non-combat killings and `` disappearances'' of civilians blamed on security forces. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> suspended the 19-month-old truce last week, but government and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> delegations were to begin meeting today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the first direct peace talks since June 1988 on ending the 8-year-old conflict. The Contras are supposed to disband and leave their Honduran camps voluntarily by early December under an Aug. 7 agreement signed by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and four other Central American governments. The rebels were not a party to the agreement, and so far most have shown no inclination to lay down their weapons and return home. Amnesty said the fate or whereabouts of scores of civilians who disappeared after being arrested still have not been clarified. Army units allegedly have killed dozens of unarmed civilians in provinces bordering <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and in Indian-dominated regions on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast where fighting against the Contras once was intense, the report said. In many cases, the victims allegedly were singled out `` in punishment or reprisal for no other reason that their suspected sympathy or support for the insurgent forces,'' it said. Witnesses also have alleged that unarmed peasants have been shot to death while fleeing army patrols seeking to enforce military conscription, it said. `` It appears that, following the withdrawal of Contra forces, some military units ... are resorting to killings during operations to identify or neutralize networks of suspected Contra supporters and sympathizers,'' the report said. `` Punitive action by the government, while indicating that it does not condone such abuses, has so far been insufficient to halt them,'' it added. It said the precise circumstances of the killings are often difficult or impossible to establish because there are no independent witnesses. The authorities contend that in some cases soldiers acted in self-defense because victims were suspected of being armed, hostile or dangerous. Military investigations have suggested other killings were criminal acts involving `` personal quarrels, or the reckless firing of weapons by drunken soldiers.'' <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said reports persist of forced recruitment, torture and executions of civilians by the U.S.-backed rebels, but said such abuses have dropped significantly in the past year. `` Preventive measures reportedly adopted by these forces to improve the conduct of their troops appear to have had little effect,'' the report said, but the number of reported abuses `` has declined significantly since the winding down of military activity in 1988 and 1989.'' The report documents 56 cases of unlawful executions by Nicaraguan troops between 1987 and 1989. In three separate cases in which 10 civilians were killed, the government sentenced 17 military and police personnel to prison terms ranging from six years to the maximum 30 years, the report said. In other cases, investigations either have been suspended or are incomplete, it said. It described how the mutilated bodies of five <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> lay preachers were found a day after they were allegedly abducted by troops searching for suspected Contras in the village of <LOCATION> Apantillo </LOCATION> on March 21, 1988. A military commission cleared army troops in nearby Matiguas of involvement, but villagers insisted the troops were responsible. Amnesty said it based its findings on three visits to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and its sources included relatives of those killed, disappeared or imprisoned. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> lifted a state of emergency in January 1988, restoring many civil and political rights that had been suspended for nearly six years, the report said.

 American citizens living and working abroad say they are unfairly taxed and unjustly deprived of many benefits available to all other Americans, including representation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. House members, in response, are setting up an unofficial <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Overseas Americans to provide a forum to air the complaints. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundberg </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abroad </ORGANIZATION> and a resident of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Wednesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens living overseas could be a great asset to their native land. `` And yet, in many ways, we find that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is at war with those of us who live abroad, and it is a war which we are losing,'' he said. `` We view our overseas citizens as a threat, and as a liability that needs to be carefully controlled,'' <PERSON> Sundberg </PERSON> told the international operations subcommittee. <PERSON> Sundberg </PERSON> and other witnesses complained the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the only country which taxes its citizens on income earned abroad, exposing them to double taxation since they are also subject to the tax codes of the countries in which they work. He said that such countries as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> provide schools for their citizens living in other countries, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not. <PERSON> Sundberg </PERSON> noted <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> also allows overseas citizens to participate in the nation's legislative process, setting aside 12 seats in the French <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for members elected by the overseas French community. `` Many federal programs do not reach beyond the water's edge,'' <PERSON> Sundberg </PERSON> said, contending more than 100,000 Americans abroad are denied Medicare benefits even though they have paid for them through their taxes. He said there is a health benefit available to veterans, but it cuts off at age 65 because <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> is supposed to start. `` It does n't overseas,'' <PERSON> Sundberg </PERSON> said, noting the health benefits for veterans terminate anyway. <PERSON> Sundberg </PERSON> also said a provision of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law cuts off monthly supplemental Social Security benefits for people who live outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for more than 30 consecutive days. And he said children born to Americans living abroad are often denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship in their own right. <PERSON> Sundberg </PERSON> endorsed legislation introduced earlier this year by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., to permit Americans residing overseas to be represented in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives He also endorsed bills introduced by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> to expand the types of income earned abroad which may be excluded from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxes and to make it easier for Americans abroad to pass on their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship to their children. Witnesses for other organizations, including the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chambers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abroad </ORGANIZATION>, contended that improving the tax status of overseas Americans would help reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit by making American companies more competitive with their overseas rivals.

<TEXT>
 NBC News President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> says his `` passion for openness'' drove him to wage an expensive, little-publicized legal battle against the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the government's radio station. As a result, <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> has changed its policies, giving Americans more access to editorial material it broadcasts in 43 languages around the world. The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>'s charter prohibits it from broadcasting inside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` They've changed their position on three fundamental issues,'' said <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON>, who built a file a foot thick in a fight that began in the early 1980s when <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> was editor of The Des Moines Register and <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think that means there is more freedom of the press in this country and I'm intensely interested in that,'' he said in a telephone interview. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> officials challenge <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION>'s contention they've shifted positions, but acknowledge they have taken steps to ensure <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> employees properly implement existing policies. <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> was drawn into the case by <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranberg </PERSON>, the Register's former editorial page editor <PERSON> Cranberg </PERSON> thought it would be interesting to see what kind of editorials <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> was sending abroad over the airwaves. When a Register staffer went to check the editorials, he ran into `` severe obstacles,'' recalled <PERSON> Cranberg </PERSON>, now a journalism professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were told they -LRB- editorials -RRB- could not be disseminated.'' <PERSON> Cranberg </PERSON> told his boss about the situation. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> was pretty incensed,'' he said. After years of trying to get the policy changed, <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s parent _ in June 1988 in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>' federal court. The lawsuit was filed in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> because <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION>, a lawyer, also is editor and co-owner of The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a newspaper with a circulation of about 10,500. Although Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> dismissed the lawsuit last month, <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> said `` a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling.'' Namely, the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> now allows the following, he said. _ Americans may publish any information they receive from <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> Only <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> employees are barred from disseminating the information. _ The general public, not just special interest groups like reporters, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and historians, is allowed access to <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> materials, such as editorials _ Anyone can copy the information, although they are n't allowed to photocopy it Summing up the changes, <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> said: `` One, is I can print it; two, is the average guy can look at it, and three, is any of us can copy, and that's a big, big change in my view.'' <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Mora </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel, disputed <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION>'s statements `` In general, that's not true. ... The court points to no evidence that we've changed any interpretation of the statute,'' he said. <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> said, however, that <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> may have received some `` confusing sorts of statements'' about policies from lower-level employees. <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> is simply `` diplomatically defending their change of position.'' Meantime, <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> said he considers his effort well worth his time and money. Joining Gartner in the lawsuit were <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> state representative, and <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company. `` I have this passion for openness and for freedom of speech and for democracy,'' said <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON>, who became president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in August 1988. While battles have been won, the war is not over. <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> intends to push <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to change <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s legislation so the public may photocopy editorials, instead of having to copy them by hand.

 Closer-than-predicted margins in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s gubernatorial election and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s mayoral contest may have a simple explanation, some pollsters say: Survey respondents lied That could explain why black candidates in the two races ran less well Tuesday than expected. The theory is that voters who opposed them hesitated to say so for fear of appearing bigoted. It even has a name: `` The Bradley effect,'' for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, a black Democrat who led in the polls in his 1982 race for governor only to lose narrowly to his white opponent, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. `` I think a lot of people cast their votes on race, and it's something that's not easily measured by polls,'' pollster <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Coker </PERSON> said Wednesday `` People are not going to freely admit they're racists to strangers.'' In unofficial returns, black Democrat <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> led white Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> by about 5,500 votes for governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and black Democrat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> won <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s mayoralty by just 2 points. Both led by greater margins in pre-election surveys, and even in surveys of voters leaving their polling places Tuesday. Did some of those voters lie to the pollsters? `` You bet,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, poll director for <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` There's a socially acceptable answer that some people feel they should give. But when it comes down to making a decision, they tend to vote using other criteria.'' Other pollsters argue that the answers are more complex _ and that most pre-election polls were not that far off. In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the last three polls before the election put <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s support at 45 percent, 52 percent and 48 _ not that far from the roughly 50 percent he received. What they understated was <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s support, estimated at 36, 41 and 44 percent respectively; he also received about 50 percent in the end. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, similarly, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> had 51 percent in a final pre-election poll by The Gallup Organization, about what he received. White Republican <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, however, was polled at 37 percent; he got 48 percent. `` The undecideds, or the people who were n't saying, broke heavily for the Republican,'' said Gallup pollster <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugick </PERSON>. Those people, almost all of them whites, may have been uncomfortable saying they opposed the black candidate, <PERSON> Hugick </PERSON> said. But he also raised another possibility: `` They truly had n't made up their minds.'' Indeed, in many previous elections pitting a black and a white, `` the people who are undecided ... have traditionally moved toward the white candidate,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankovic </PERSON>, a pollster at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. If polls on Tuesday's election reflected that, she suggested, they would have been near the mark. `` I think that people are choosing to ascribe an easy explanation, i.e., lying, when there other methodological explanations available,'' <PERSON> Frankovic </PERSON> said. `` They're just harder to write about, harder to talk about, and the words are longer.'' Still, <PERSON> Coker </PERSON>, who polled in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, saw no other explanation for his exit poll result Tuesday: It found a 55-45 percent victory for <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> among voters leaving their polling places, far overstating the black candidate's showing and understating the white's. But on two other races, in which there were no black candidates, <PERSON> Coker </PERSON>'s results proved almost exactly correct. `` The history of exit polling and other polling has been that when there's no racial issue involved, they're pretty accurate. When there is, you're never quite sure,'' said <PERSON> Coker </PERSON>. `` You can only go with what the people tell you.''

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Most businesses and schools remained closed on the second day of a widely observed 48-hour strike to protest the arrest and apparent being in police custody of three opposition leaders. Transportation in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> and all other major cities in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> was paralyzed Wednesday, the second day of the strike. Government trucks providing free transportation were virtually empty. Almost all the estimated 15,000 factory workers at the industrial park, on the north side of this city of 1 million, did not report to work. No violence was reported. `` The success of the strike will give the army food for thought. Human rights and the constitution have got to be respected,'' conservative politician <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Latortue </PERSON> said in an interview. The goverment on Nov. 2 accused <PERSON> Jean-Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesyeux </PERSON>, co-leader of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s largest union; <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Etienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> of conspiring to assassinate <LOCATION> Haitian </LOCATION> ruler Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> and superior officers and to blow up the presidential palace. The three were displayed on state television that night with swollen faces, bandaged heads and bloodied shirts _ apparently resulting from beatings. `` The aim of their appearance on television was probably to terrorize the population,'' said <PERSON> Latortue </PERSON>, a former justice minister and presidential candidate. `` We thought we had put an end to such police brutality in 1986'' when dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled into exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, he said. Outraged by the television display, nearly 100 human rights, political, civic and neighborhood groups rallied to the strike called by <PERSON> Mesyeux </PERSON>'s union, the Autonomous Central of Haitian Workers. `` It is a strike of the revolted conscience,'' <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has no credibility left to govern with. He must release the three prisoners, and he must resign,'' said conservative political leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s bishops, in a statement broadcast by the Roman Catholic Church-owned Radio Soleil Tuesday night, expressed shocked at the resurgence of police brutality and urged respect for human rights.

<HEAD>Witnesses Say Food Shipments Mixing With Industrial Cargo</HEAD>

 Trucks and railcars are hauling garbage into <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s breadbasket and then carrying food on the way back with little or no cleaning in between, according to testimony on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Witnesses told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel of trucks that carry meat and solid waste on alternate trips, trailers that haul food along with insects left from garbage runs and diesel fuel from one shipment seeping into flour in the next cargo. `` Would you like your bacon and eggs delivered on any of these trucks?'' Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, asked the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials on Wednesday. The subcommittee is considering legislation on hazardous materials safety, including a ban on so-called `` backhauling'' of garbage to <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> dumps after shipments of food to the east. `` The need to dispose of waste at long distance landfills coincides with the desire of trucking companies to obtain a ` backhaul' from the East,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaillard </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> traced the activities of one refrigerated truck trailer that was seen at a <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, landfill and a <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, waste transfer station. Investigators found that of 29 loads it carried over three months, eight were meat cargoes, six were solid waste and 15 others were listed as miscellaneous shipments. <PERSON> Gaillard </PERSON> said that at a Hubbard, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, truck washing station, investigators found one truck that hauled avocados from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> before picking up a load of trash still reeked of garbage after the washing. He said truck trailers were routinely rinsed with hot water not exceeding 100 degrees and with no detergent or other cleaning agent. <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Hoosiers </ORGANIZATION> Opposed to Polluting the Environment, said maggots survived the cleaning of non-refrigerated trailers that made what she described as a `` Midwest garbage run'' to the private Center Point, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, Landfill. `` When one truck driver was questioned if this was a ` standard cleaning job,' he replied, ` Yes, once the liquid is absorbed into the wood the maggots crawl into the moist cracks and the flies later hatch,''' she said. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, whose group has a `` Dump Patrol'' that monitors the landfill, said she also witnessed shippers use the same tarpaulin to cover garbage and shipments of produce. She said there was evidence of medical waste being hauled, and one trucker allegedly was stuck by a needle and contracted AIDS. <PERSON> Aldan </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> contaminated loads have caused serious economic consequences. He said in one case, more than $ 1 million worth of dairy cattle died and milk had to be dumped for four weeks when a rail car bringing an arsenic compound to a <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> smelter took on a load of feed grain afterward. After some state residents complained of oily-tasting biscuits, <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON> said, inspectors discovered that two boxcars of flour were hauled in a car that had carried barrels of diesel oil. In another case, fresh market potatoes got a green coating when lead-based paint pigment was not cleaned from a car carrying the tubers, he said.

<HEAD>Energy Advisers Doubt Near-Term Potential for Accelerator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Energy Department advisers are casting doubt on suggestions that a linear accelerator may be a cheaper and safer way of making tritium _ a key nuclear warhead ingredient _ than new nuclear reactors now on the drawing board. An advisory panel to Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said in a draft report released Wednesday that a main problem with an accelerator is that large amounts of electricity would be needed to run the facility. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was meeting today to review the report. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has strongly supported a plan, prepared by his <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration predecessor, to build two new nuclear reactors to make tritium. They would replace government reactors in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> that are nearing the end of their useful lives. The new reactors are estimated to cost at least $ 6.8 billion. The department has said it needs to get started on replacements for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> reactors soon, so it would rather pursue the relatively simple reactor option instead of the accelerator technology, which is not fully developed. But scientists at two <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> laboratories concluded earlier this year that a linear accelerator would be cheaper and safer than a new reactor and could be ready sooner. In August, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> asked his advisers to study how soon an accelerator might be feasible and at what cost. An accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target, in this case lithium clad in aluminium. The resulting collision produces tritium. In a separate report Wednesday, the advisory panel said claims for the discovery of a new nuclear process called `` cold fusion'' are too weak to justify special government research efforts. The group told <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> it found no persuasive evidence that the cold fusion process first claimed by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> scientists last March would produce useful sources of energy. If such a process could work on a large scale it would make possible limitless supplies of cheap energy. `` Nuclear fusion at room temperature would be contrary to all understanding gained of nuclear reactions in the last half century; it would require the existence of an as-yet-undiscovered nuclear process,'' the report said. The advisory board said a chief concern about the accelerator is that it would require 800 megawatts of continuous power _ nearly the equivalent of the entire output of a large commercial power station. The board called this power requirement `` an amount that is not only costly but may not be readily available in the time frame of the years 2000 to 2040'' when the accelerator would be working. It said a new power station _ possibly a nuclear reactor _ might have to be built just to provide electricity for the accelerator. `` It may be simpler, in fact, to use a nuclear reactor to produce tritium directly ... rather than have it, or a fossil plant, produce electricity to operate the accelerator,'' the report said. The board's report said this and other issues would be considered in greater detail before next February, when a final report is due to <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>.

 A Jewish soldier who says he saved his battalion by singlehandedly shooting to death more than 500 Japanese soldiers may soon receive the Medal of Honor he believes was denied because of his religion. Marshaling the support of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, an authenticated photograph taken from the body of a Japanese soldier, and affidavits from two former commanders, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON> thinks he has enough evidence to win official recognition 47 years after the deed. <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>, 72, believes he was nominated for a Medal of Honor during World War II but denied the award because of the actions of an anti-Semitic commander. He has vowed to keep fighting for the award. `` If I give up, I'm beaten and I'm a fighter,'' <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON> said in an interview last year. `` If I lose, the Jewish people lose and then I'm going to let them down.'' According to <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>'s story, the heroic deed took place Dec. 1-2, 1942, in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> swamp known as `` The Triangle,'' during an attack by Japanese troops on <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>'s 128th Infantry unit. The former communications sergeant jumped into a machine gun fortification after it was abandoned by other soldiers and fired nearly 3,500 rounds of ammunition on the Japanese during 21 hours. Officials investigating <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>'s complaint said a photograph discovered this spring has brought strong credence to his claim. They officials spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON> came across the photograph in March while visiting an Army companion in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The photograph, reportedly taken from the pocket of dead Japanese soldier, shows a group picture of a Japanese military unit. A handwritten message in Japanese on the back said the picture's bearer had decided to commit suicide after he and other officers sent men into a battle in which `` 600 fine Japanese soldiers died because of a solitary <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier. Sen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, D-Wis., began working on <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>'s behalf in January and had the photograph examined this spring The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the photo was printed on paper from 1942 and the writing was from ink produced in 1942. The note on the back was interpreted by the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Based on my review of the evidence, as well as the contacts my office has had with Mr. <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>, I have concluded that he earned the Medal of Honor,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. Maj. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> of the Army Awards Branch in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said a review of <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>'s case began in January 1988 and a decision should be issued by the end of the year. Under Title 10 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Code, all recommendations for a medal from World War II had to have been submitted by May 1951. Thus investigators must determine whether a recommendation was made for <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>, and if so whether anti-Semitism played on role in the denial of the award, <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> said. He said the investigation into the medal `` must prove incontestable evidence. This is very difficult to do, after nearly half a century.'' <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON> has declined interviews recently, saying he wants to wait for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. But in an editorial he wrote for the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> last year, he said he was told in 1986 that his former commanding officers had nominated him for a medal. <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON> said he then began investigating why he had n't received <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stehling </PERSON>, a retired brigadier general who lives in <LOCATION> Beaver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION>, signed an affidavit outlining <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON>'s actions and confirming he nominated <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON> for the honor. Retired Gen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who died in September, signed a similar affidavit. Another affidavit signed by a military messenger said Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, now dead, had denied <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON> his medal because <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON> was Jewish. In the 1988 interview, <PERSON> Rubitsky </PERSON> said he had received numerous anti-Semitic phone calls and threats after deciding to fight for the medal. `` It's not really the medal,'' he said. `` It is the anti-Semitism that existed then and still exists now. I want people to know there is still discrimination.''

 <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Swierczek </PERSON>'s recovery from leukemia is being aided by a computer that keeps him in touch with classmates and his fourth-grade teacher, who transmits assignments from 3,000 miles away. Two months after <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> was diagnosed with leukemia in June, the family temporarily moved from Media, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, so the 9-year-old could undergo a bone marrow transplant at <ORGANIZATION> Fred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutchinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Electronic mail from friends, as well as daily school assignments, arrive via a computer service offered by <ORGANIZATION> Prodigy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>. Forget the classwork, says <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, who's more interested in keeping up with his pals and playing games on the computer with two younger brothers who have joined him for his recovery at an apartment near the hospital. With the extra attention being shown <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, his mother, June, has used the computer to begin her Christmas shopping and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON>, relied on Prodigy to reserve airline tickets for the family's Dec. 23 trip back to the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> loaned the family a computer, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> loaned <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s elementary school a computer, and Prodigy donated the software and three free months of the service to both parties, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Twiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> branch manager for Prodigy The <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based service allows users to communicate with subscribers across the country using local phone lines. It offers services such as news, weather, movie reviews and stock prices for a $ 9.95 a month. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s mother said she's hoping her son's communications with the school will prevent him from repeating the fourth grade. Just as important, she said, is keeping <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> in close touch with his classmates. Mrs. <PERSON> Swierczek </PERSON> said the computer service helps <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> feel closer to his classmates. `` They're do n't really talk on the phone at this age,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Swierczek </PERSON> said. But his friends are all very interested in the computer and frequently leave messages, even the girls, she said. `` It definitely makes him feel more in touch,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Swierczek </PERSON> said. The family came to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> after chemotherapy treatments in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> failed to cure <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> and the wait for a bone marrow transplant there was too long, Mrs. <PERSON> Swierczek </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swierczek </PERSON>'s bone marrow was found to be the closest match to his son's and, on Sept. 9, it was transplanted during a 10-hour operation. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> has made it past the point where he would have an acute rejection of the transplant, Mrs. <PERSON> Swierczek </PERSON> said. But doctors must wait 100 days after a transplant before they know if <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> needs treatment with steroids to maintain his body's acceptance of his father's bone marrow, she said. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> was released from the hospital Oct. 4. But since his immune system is still weakened from the transplants and chemotherapy, he mainly stays in the house to avoid contracting illnesses.

 A woman who accused Miss <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> of pulling a gun on her after a traffic accident denied running the pageant winner off a road and beating her head against the pavement during their fracas. `` I did n't do either of those things,'' said <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>, 23, of Fairmont, who was charged with reckless driving, battery and destruction of property after the altercation Tuesday morning with <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>, 21. <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> filed a criminal complaint alleging that <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> kicked out a window on her car, grabbed her by the hair and beat her head against the pavement while screaming obscenities at her after <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>'s car ran into a telephone pole. `` I admit I pulled her hair and kicked the window out of her car, but I did n't do any of the other things she said I did,'' <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said in an interview Wednesday. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> filed a complaint saying <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> pulled a gun on her during the altercation. Police arrested <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> and charged her with brandishing a deadly weapon. Both women were arraigned on the misdemeanor charges Tuesday night. <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> was freed on a $ 200 personal recognizance bond and <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> set free on a $ 350 personal recognizance bond, said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Twyman </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> magistrate. No hearing date has been set. <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> faces up to six months in jail and a $ 200 fine if convicted on the weapon charge. Several telephone calls to <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>'s residence Wednesday were answered by a machine. She had not returned the calls by late Wednesday. <PERSON> Jodi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bice </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>'s traveling companion and business manager, said <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> told her she did n't have a weapon. `` She said there was no gun and I've never known her to have one,'' <PERSON> Bice </PERSON> said.

 A large sign lists all Masses in Polish, but the hundreds of ethnic Germans headed for the mountain-top monastery in this former German region are coming to pray in their mother tongue. Franciscan monks have allowed celebration of Sunday Mass in German since June, and word has spread quickly among the thousands of ethnic Germans scattered throughout southwestern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Although gasoline is in short supply, worshipers often drive more than an hour each Sunday to gather at one of the few churches in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to offer services in German. A tightly-knit community, ethnic Germans in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to number 80,000. Most are concentrated in the former German territories of <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>. Ethnic Germans had hoped for a large turnout on Sunday, when Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was to attend a German-language Mass at the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION> monastery, known in German as <LOCATION> Annaberg </LOCATION>. The trip to the monastery was scratched, however, because the government was uncomfortable over a visit to the area, the site of a fierce battle in 1921 between Polish and German partisans over whether the area would go to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Polish-German relations in the region have been strained since the Nazi invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1939, and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> authorities apparently feared a visit by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who arrived in the country today for a five-day visit, would stir ethnic tensions. More than one-third of present-day <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was formerly German territory, and millions of Germans were expelled after the regions were awarded to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after the war. An alternate site for <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to meet ethnic Germans was found at <LOCATION> Krzyzowa </LOCATION>, known as <LOCATION> Kreisau </LOCATION> in German, a town where opponents of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> met to map out resistance plans. Some of the <LOCATION> Kreisau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> members were later involved in the abortive July 20, 1944, plot to kill <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> at an East Prussian bunker now located in northern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Ethnic Germans blamed the Polish government for conflict over a visit to <LOCATION> Gora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anny </PERSON> and say they plan to make a strong showing by organizing buses for the open-air Mass at <LOCATION> Krzyzowa </LOCATION> About 500 people who attended Mass in German on Sunday were urged by the priest, a Franciscan friar, to go to <LOCATION> Krzyzowa </LOCATION> and then provided with detailed instructions on how to get there. `` The Poles are afraid of us. We do n't want to hurt the Poles but we want to feel German,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, one of the leaders of the German Friendship Circle. The group maintains close links with groups of Silesians in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. As long as they can prove <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> heritage, ethnic Germans in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> can automatically receive West German citizenship if they decide to emigrate. But the Germans at <LOCATION> Gora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anny </PERSON> said they want to remain in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> `` We want to stay here. We have been here for 600 years. This is our homeland,'' said Urban. But he added: `` We want our children to learn German and we want our own schools and churches.'' All prayer books and guides sold at the monastery are in Polish. But down near the parking lot, one elderly German-speaker did a brisk business selling copies of the day's service and hymns in German for about 65 cents. Like many other social and ethnic groups, the German minority was forbidden to form independent associations under the previous Communist government. That leadership has been replaced with a Solidarity-led government. Ethnic Germans benefited from a law passed earlier this year allowing the official registration of independent groups. At least two associations for the promotion of German culture have been formed.

 Middle school students near the town where an 11-year-old boy was abducted last month are sending letters to students around the country asking for help in finding him. `` If somebody would see it, and they might see <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> ...'' said 11-year-old <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkman </PERSON>. `` They might be able to alert somebody,'' added <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottwald </PERSON>, 13. <LOCATION> Paynesville </LOCATION> is 30 miles southwest of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jospeh </PERSON>, the town of 3,000 people where <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetterling </PERSON> was kidnapped Oct. 22 while riding bikes with two friends. <ORGANIZATION> Paynesville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lund </ORGANIZATION> said some children are afraid to go outside alone and others have told of nightmares. `` We had a lot of our middle school students really concerned much more than expected. We were surprised by how affected they were,'' <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> said. On Monday and Tuesday, students made white yarn bracelets that they will distribute to remind people to look for <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>. The children gethered in the gym Wednesday and formed circles, held hands, and listened to a girls' choir sing `` Somewhere Out There.'' Many of the children tied white ribbons around their ankles, or wore white clothing. Some carried signs or wore T-shirts saying `` Jacob's Hope.'' `` I think it helps get rid of some of that tension and fear,'' <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> said. `` I think it helps them feel they are doing something positive for <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>.'' Each of the 430 fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth graders at the school wrote a letter to a middle school somewhere in the nation. The main body of each letter was already typed. Students filled in information about themselves and included pictures of <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> and of a van that may be involved in the abduction. `` We are concerned that as each day goes by, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>'s abductor may be taking him further and further from his home,'' the letter says. `` Each of the students in our school is trying to help out by sending these flyers to schools in other areas of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

 Chinese senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> has resigned as chairman of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, his top remaining formal leadership post, a semi-official news agency reported Thursday. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was replaced by his latest protege, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, in a personnel switch approved Thursday by a party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 85, has been seeking to retire from all his top positions to make way for a new generation of leaders centered around <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, who reportedly had sought the chairmanship over <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s objections, was named first vice chairman of the commission, the report said. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is expected to remain <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s paramount leader even after stepping down from the commission because of his stature as architect of Chinese policy over the past decade and his connections. Diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have said there was a power struggle in the party hierarchy centering on the military commission, which sets policy for the armed forces. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, who had been permanent vice chairman of the commission, reportedly sought to solidify his place in the post-Deng era by winning the position. But other senior party members felt the post should be automatically assigned to the party general secretary. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, 62, was named party chief June 24 after <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> was purged from the post for his tolerance of the pro-democracy movement, which the military crushed on June 4, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has named <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, who lacks a national power base, to lead the country as head of the next generation of Chinese leaders. The news agency report, which could not be independently confirmed immediately, said <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Huaqing </PERSON>, formerly deputy secretary general of the commission, was named the other vice chairman of the commission. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Baibing </PERSON>, the political boss of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>'s younger brother, was named secretary-general of the commission, the news agency said. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was purged twice by radicals during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, then staged a comeback that turned <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> around. He transformed a country dominated by ideological battles into one with pragmatic, market-oriented economic policies. Living standards have improved for millions of Chinese but the modernization drive led to serious problems of inflation and corruption. The Communist leadership is now seeking to remedy those problems, with the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> expected to approve an economic austerity program during its current session. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> wears a hearing aid and smokes heavily but is not known to have any serious health problem.

<HEAD>Officials Investigate Radioactive Leak at Ohio Nuke Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMISBURG, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An accident during an experiment at a plant that produces nuclear detonators caused its heaviest discharge of tritium gas in at least 20 years and contaminated four workers, officials said. No evacuations were necessary. About 3.7 grams of radioactive tritium was released Wednesday at the Mound Nuclear Production Plant, 10 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>. The accident released about 10 times the gas normally discharged from the government-run plant each year and was the largest at the plant since the 1960s, said safety director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neff </PERSON>. But he characterized it as a minor leak. `` We do n't believe we had a significant amount that went up,'' <PERSON> Neff </PERSON> said. The plant produces detonators for nuclear bombs and propulsion systems for space vehicles. Plant officials initially estimated that no more than a few dozen residents could have been exposed to a maximum of 12 millirems of tritium, the equivalent of one chest X-ray. But plant spokesman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Charbeneau </PERSON> later said the maximum off-site dosage was 0.051 millirem. A person taking a plane across the country would be exposed to 3 millirems, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s standard of safe dosage is 25 millirems a year. The accident occurred when a quartz window in a bell jar containing tritium shattered. The tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, was vented into an exhaust stack. Plant workers had been engaged in a measurement process in which a laser beam is passed through the quartz to aid the movement of tritium, <PERSON> Charbeneau </PERSON> said. He would not comment on the purpose of the experiment, but said, `` We've done that before. It's not a new process.'' <PERSON> Neff </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the city of <LOCATION> Miamisburg </LOCATION> were notified. <PERSON> Neff </PERSON> said four of the 52 workers in the building where the accident occurred tested positive for tritium. The levels were relatively low, he said, but the exact dosage wo n't be known until further testing. <PERSON> Neff </PERSON> said tritium was `` relatively low-risk compared to most radioactive materials.'' About 2,200 workers are employed at the plant, which is operated for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> by </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G Mound Applied Technologies.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index gained slightly after nervous ups and downs today, while the dollar fell against the Japanese yen for the second consecutive day. The dollar closed at 142.70 yen, down 0.27 yen from Wednesday's close of 142.97 yen It opened at 143.33 yen and ranged between 142.67 yen and 143.33 yen. The dollar fell by 0.66 yen on Wednesday. On Thursday, it was falling on news that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks had cut their prime lending rate, currency traders said. Lower interest rates tend to make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors. `` Despite the narrowing interest rate gap between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the dollar has been bullish because of persistent demand among Japanese investors,'' said <PERSON> Mitsuhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinugasa </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> trader. `` That's mainly because investors have been buying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money prior to the auction of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities,'' he said. An estimated $ 6.71 billion changed hands today, down from Wednesday's $ 7.76 billion. On the stock exchange, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> gained 61.83 points, or 0.17 percent, closing at 35,657.42. The index fell in the morning and slipped further in the early afternoon as investors, including <ORGANIZATION> Solomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, sold spot issues for technical adjustments, said <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomura </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The Nikkei rose back when investors started to pick up issues whose prices had fallen, he said. Buying from foreign securities firms, mainly <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION>, for option trading also boosted the index, <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> said. Today was the last day for November options. `` But today's major players were securities dealers, who tend to buy and sell back issues frequently according to the fluctuation in the index,'' <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> said. `` That's why the Nikkei went up and down so nervously,'' he said. Trading was fairly active, with first section volume estimated at 800 million shares, unchanged from the previous day. Among gainers were shipbuilding, electric power plant and steel issues.

<HEAD>Former Nuclear Executive Tapped for Key Waste Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will nominate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, a former executive of a Massachusetts-based government contractor, to manage the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s high-level nuclear waste program, congressional and other sources said. The selection comes amid growing criticism on Capitol Hill of delays in the department's efforts to build a permanent dump for radioactive waste from nuclear power plants. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to nominate <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> for the waste job later this month, the sources said Wednesday, speaking on condition they not be identified. If confirmed, <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> would fill a void in the waste program that has plagued the Energy Department for two years. The current head of the waste management office, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON>, holds the job on an interim basis. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> would become a central figure in the federal government's bitter struggle with <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> over efforts to build the nation's first permanent dump for high-level nuclear waste. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> has blocked the department's efforts to begin studying <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, about 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, as the only candidate site for the proposed underground dump. The standoff, with other problems, is expected to force <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> to announce a further delay in the target date for opening a permanent waste dump. The current target date is 2003. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> is drawing increasing criticism on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> for his failure to break the waste impasse. In a letter released earlier this week, four influential <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members told <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> they were `` appalled'' the waste management office has been without a director for two years and that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> appeared to be planning major changes in the waste program without consulting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The letter, dated Oct. 17, was signed by Reps. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich.; <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, Sources who declined to be identified said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has decided to bring <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> into the department as a special adviser until routine <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background checks are completed and he is confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Both the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the department declined to confirm the <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> selection, saying there would be no comment until a nominee was announced. The company at which <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> had worked for the last decade, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is an engineering contractor to various government agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> was manager of the company's office of nuclear engineering until he quit earlier this fall, company officials said. The company declined to specify the work it had performed for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Female Gang Member May Have Forced 11-year-old Into Rape Initiation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An 11-year-old girl who was repeatedly raped as part of a gang's initiation may have been forced into the ordeal by a friend, a 17-year-old female member of the gang, police said. Five members of the Gangster Disciples were charged Wednesday with raping the girl Saturday night, but <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchannon </PERSON> said as many as 10 or 20 young men may have been involved The young men apparently considered the rapes to be a rite of initiation for the girl, making her their `` queen,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Pippen </PERSON>. `` Queen'' describes a girl who has been initiated by having sex with all of a gang's members, he said. Gang members usually try to entice a girl, normally someone they know, into participating willingly in the initiation, <PERSON> Pippen </PERSON> said. In this case, he said, the girl apparently did not participate willingly but was too afraid to resist. The incident started while the girl was staying at the home of her 17-year-old friend, a gang member, police said. They said the older girl tried to talk her friend into going outside for a walk. `` The girl did n't want to, but her friend dragged her out, even though she knew what was waiting for that little girl,'' <PERSON> Buchannon </PERSON> said. The girl was taken by her older friend and the gang members to a park where the rapes took place, he said. `` The gang members let the girl go when they started worrying about whether they'd get caught,'' <PERSON> Buchannon </PERSON> said. At least one of the boys threatened to kill her if she told anyone, he said. The girl returned to her friend's house after the rape and did not call authorities or her parents, <PERSON> Buchannon </PERSON> said. Residents who heard about the rape flagged down <PERSON> Pippen </PERSON> and his partner during their patrol Sunday and told them about it. The deputies found the girl still at her friend's house and questioned her. The five gang members were arrested later Sunday. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 18, was charged as an adult and the four others were charged with being juvenile deliquents accused of rape, <PERSON> Buchannon </PERSON> said. Three are 17 and one is 14. He said that to his knowledge, none of the five, all students at <ORGANIZATION> Brighton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, had been in trouble before. He described them as being from middle-class families.

<TEXT>
 A judge has banned testimony about the victim's criminal record in the case of a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officer who shot and killed a black motorcyclist, sparking three days of racial disturbances Dade County Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> ruled Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Clement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> previous drug convictions, and defense contentions that he was collecting drug proceeds the day of his death, were irrelevant to the case. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, an attorney for suspended <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, said the ruling hurt his effort to defend the 30-year-old policeman against manslaughter charges. The defense wanted to show <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was desperate and drugged enough to try to run over <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>. `` He's excluded our entire defense,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was a drug dealer out collecting his profits; he did n't want to be stopped.'' <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> did allow evidence that <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, had 5.5 grams of marijuana and $ 1,500 dollars in cash on him at the time of the shooting. In his blood, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> had alcohol and high levels of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana _ evidence which also can be introduced in court. The judge banned any mention of similar evidence concerning <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> passenger, who died when the motorcyle crashed after the shooting. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> faces two manslaughter counts in the deaths. During the hearing, prosecutors told the judge the defense should not be allowed to put <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, both black, on trial instead of <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>. Lead prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> remained cautious about his victory in pretrial motions. `` We're happy with some of them, unhappy with others,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said. `` But obviously we won some motions that were important to us.'' <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> allowed the prosecution to use testimony about <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> city police regulations to prove <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> acted negligently and unprofessionally when he shot and killed <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> on Jan. 16. Those regulations are much more restrictive than <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s `` fleeing felon'' law, which the defense argued should be the standard to judge the officer <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> fired one shot, hitting <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> in the head and killing him, as the motorcyclist sped away from another officer. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> contends the motorcycle was heading straight at him. Prosecutors say <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police policy dictated that he should get out of the way, and should not have fired at a moving vehicle. In the riot that followed the shooting, one person was killed, 11 were wounded by gunfire and 13 buildings were burned down in predominantly black neighborhoods. The defense on Wednesday also sought to introduce statements contending the prosecution was racially and politically motivated, and that some prosecutors had privately acknowledged that. But the judge denied that testimony.

 A <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> shopping mall that attracted interest from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Filipino prosecutors for its ties to former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> drew only one bidder at a foreclosure auction. Real estate developer <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> led a group of investors who bought <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a 10-story vertical mall across the street from <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>'s flagship store, for the minimum bid of $ 25 million Wednesday. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, allegedly bought the mall and three other <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> properties with money looted from their homeland's treasury <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> died in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in September, leaving his wife to face numerous lawsuits in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, including a criminal indictment. The court-appointed special master of the auction, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Estroff </PERSON>, said he was disappointed that more bidders did not come forward. `` Retailing in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> is undergoing stress,'' <PERSON> Estroff </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has suffered from poor business in recent years, with retail and restaurant outlets dropping from a high of 70 to the current 45 tenants. But <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> was optimistic about its future. `` <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> is the premier retail location in the country today,'' he said. `` If properly directed, we are going to have some good response.'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said his group would announce its plans for the center soon. The auction of <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> was part of a foreclosure action by the property's mortgage holder, <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> and Real Services. Money from the sale will go toward a $ 58.65 million foreclosure judgment awarded Security Pacific by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Leval </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leval </PERSON>, who presides over one of the Philippine lawsuits, allowed the sale of three of the buildings and said any proceeds left over would be held by the court pending the outcome of the litigation. One of the other buildings, 40 Wall St., was sold for $ 108.6 million at auction in August but the sale collapsed when the buyers failed raise the money by the Oct. 10 closing date. That building will be re-auctioned Monday. An auction date has not been set yet for a third property. Foreclosure proceedings are under way for the fourth property and a sale is expected soon.

<TEXT>
 A man whose defense hinges on his claim of involvement in a plot to kill <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s former leader is an internationally known heroin dealer trying to avoid prison, prosecutors said. `` You would create any sort of story. You would say anything,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Regan </PERSON> said Wednesday as he began cross-examining <PERSON> Mushtaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Malik </PERSON>. The 41-year-old defendant has testified that his involvement with an accused drug dealer was merely an effort to track down a man who double-crossed him in a plot kill <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> President Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>. The plot, <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> has said, was orchestrated by officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose current leader is Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> died in a mysterious plane crash Aug. 17, 1988. A Pakistani official has denied the assassination plot. <PERSON> O'Regan </PERSON> reeled off a string of alleged heroin smuggling acts in which he said <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> was involved, including a `` double-dipping'' scheme with a German official in which <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> dealt heroin and then tipped off the official to the shipment, thereby reaping the sale and reward. <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> called the allegations baseless. The defendant appeared to be at odds with his attorney, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrarone </PERSON>, frequently telling the defense attorney to sit down when he tried to raise objections to the prosecutor's cross-examination. <PERSON> Malik </PERSON>, who said he's of royal blood and known as `` The Black Prince'' in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, has stopped short of saying he was involved in the plane crash that killed <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> <PERSON> Riaz </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, has told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Malik </PERSON>'s claim of an assassination plot was `` another attempt by the drug mafia to discredit the government because of <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s campaign against the drug trade.'' Pakistani officials, including those who served <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, at first blamed the plane crash on Soviet and Afghan agents operating against <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for their support of Afghan Mujahedeen. After <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> came to power, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Ejaz </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, and some opposition right-wingers blamed her ruling <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> in early 1985 was convicted in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and served more than two years in prison for heroin trafficking.

<HEAD>Hugo May Be to Blame for Death of Rare Wolf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stress or injury from Hurricane Hugo probably contributed to the death of the sole male red wolf in a wildlife refuge, but four pups of the endangered species appear healthy, the refuge manager said. The 7-year-old wolf had been released on <LOCATION> Bulls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast, with a female adult in an attempt to reintroduce the species, which had become extinct in the wild. The male adult's carcass was discovered Saturday, about three weeks after the animal died, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garris </PERSON>, the refuge manager. `` We're not sure of the cause,'' <PERSON> Garris </PERSON> said. `` He probably sustained injury during <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> or the stress was too much for him.'' The carcass was not found earlier because trees felled by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> on Sept. 21 blocked island roads until last week. The hurricane, with 135 mph winds, came ashore at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, about 20 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Bulls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The four 6-month-old female pups appear healthy, and could be transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Alligator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> within several months, once they learn hunting techniques, <PERSON> Garris </PERSON> said. A Cape <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> employee is tracking them and giving them food. Born in a zoo, the male adult and a female adult were released on Bulls Island in 1987. An alligator killed the female less than a year later and the male raised their two male pups. The pups later were transferred to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> refuge, where they still live. A second female wolf was introduced on <LOCATION> Bulls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> last winter. The pair produced five female offspring in the spring. Days later, an alligator killed the mother, and one pup later was killed by another alligator. The red wolf once ranged from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> east to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast and north to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, but began disappearing because of their inability to adapt to changes in the land and predator control. In 1973, after the passage of the Endangered Species Act, the entire red wolf population in southeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> was captured to prevent its extinction. The red wolf is smaller than the gray wolf, with females weighing 40-60 pounds and males weighing 60-80 pounds. The black-footed ferret is the only mammal that is rarer than the red wolf in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 What a blast! Sheriff's deputies attacked the drug problem by blowing up mounds of dirt before marijuana could be replanted in them.

<TEXT>
 Babies born to refugees from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> are at high risk of catching hepatitis B and should be routinely vaccinated against the dangerous virus, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health officials recommended today. Long-time carriers of the virus have an increased risk of liver cancer and chronic liver disease. The younger people are when they catch the hepatitis virus, the more likely they are to die of these diseases. Since 1975, nearly 1 million people have moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, where infection with the hepatitis B virus is extremely common. In today's study, doctors from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> found that the children of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> immigrants have a substantial risk of catching the virus, even if they are free of it at birth. The research, directed by Dr. <PERSON> Adele </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It was based on 196 refugee families with 257 children who were born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The virus is frequently passed from mother to child before birth. In the families studied, 55 percent of the children born to mothers with infectious disease had the infection. However, 7 percent of the children whose mothers were free of the infection also had the virus. The researchers concluded that child-to-child transmission was responsible for at least some of the hepatitis B infections. Under current guidelines, vaccination is recommended only for newborns of mothers with infectious disease. The researcher said this should be expanded to include all newborn children of refugees from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoofnagle </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> and Digestive and <ORGANIZATION> Kidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diseases </ORGANIZATION> agreed with the proposal. `` This advice is sound,'' he wrote, `` and if followed, will contibute materially to the good health of the children of these first-generation Americans.''

<HEAD>Study: Breast Cancer Linked with X-rays During Infancy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Exposure to radiation even during infancy can significantly increase women's risk of breast cancer when they reach adulthood, a study published today confirms. The research was based on a long-term follow-up of women who were given X-ray therapy shortly after birth for treatment of enlarged thymus glands. Such treatment was common until the late 1950s, when doctors realized that seemingly enlarged thymuses were actually normal. By age 36, the study found that those who had received the treatment were nearly four times more likely to get breast cancer than were sisters who did not receive the radiation. The researchers said their work `` suggests that irradiation of the female breast at a very early age can have harmful effects that do not appear until many years later.'' Experts have long recognized that breast tissue is extremely sensitive to the damaging effects of radiation. Until recently, they believed that only those who received radiation during adolescence or adulthood would be harmed. However, recent follow-up of <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> girls exposed to radiation from atomic bombs during World War II found they also had an increased risk of breast cancer later in life. The latest study, directed by Dr. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildreth </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dentistry </ORGANIZATION>, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The doctors followed 1,201 women who received X-ray treatment for enlarged thymuses and 2,469 of their sisters who did not get radiation. There were 22 cases of breast cancer among the radiation group and 12 among the sisters. Another study in the journal, conducted by Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>, followed 31,710 who received repeated diagnostic X-rays for tuberculosis. This study found the greatest risk of breast cancer among those who got the X-rays between ages 10 and 14. The risk fell with increasing age.

<HEAD>Predictions of Conversion Rate Trigger Panic Selling of Dollars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Poles rushed to sell hoarded dollars after officials predicted the Polish zloty could be convertible by year's end, sending the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency into a tailspin on the unofficial market The dollar has lost nearly 30 percent of its value in legal private trading over the past week and has dropped by 50 percent over the past month. On Wednesday, banks and commercial traders were paying between 4,800 and 5,000 zlotys per dollar _ down from more than 10,000 in early October and from 6,300 on Monday. Dollar dumping has accelerated with predictions that the commercial rate will soon be brought into line with the official rate for foreign business transactions, now at 2,800 zlotys per dollar. Panic selling ensued after the pro-Solidarity daily <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> reported the discussion at a Monday Cabinet meeting of fixing a uniform conversion rate of 3,500 zlotys to the dollar by year's end. Officials contend the dramatic fall of the dollar on what used to be the black market could be a step toward stabilizing the Polish monetary system and encouraging farmers to put up more of their produce for sale. But millions of Poles who amass dollars to control their buying power in times of spiraling inflation are seeing their personal wealth devasted. `` I have to buy a car, so I am forced to sell my dollars,'' said <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Oblencki </PERSON>, an engineer among more than 100 people lined up at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poland </ORGANIZATION> office in central <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> early Wednesday. Like many Poles saving for expensive items, <PERSON> Oblencki </PERSON> had been buying dollars on the commercial market for months, assuming the dollars would hold their value better than the troubled zlotys. Inflation, currently estimated at over 600 percent annually, has undermined public confidence in the Polish currency. The selling rush of the past few days has overwhelmed private traders, who have run out of zlotys and have been forced to suspend buying dollars. `` If I had zlotys to sell I could buy $ 100,000 to $ 200,000 just today,'' said <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Kujawa </PERSON>, director of a currency exchange on bustling <LOCATION> Pulawska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kujawa </PERSON> is one of dozens of private traders operating in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. In a transition to a more market-oriented economy, the government in January gave official sanction to private money-trading in hopes of luring dollars from people reluctant to put their money in the bank. The private traders determine conversion rates based on the daily demand from government and industry for hard currency to purchase goods abroad. `` Even the wisest man can not foresee what will happen in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, or whether the dollar will go up or down,'' said <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Daczewski </PERSON>, a department head of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The true value of the dollar in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> at present is between 6,000 and 7,000 zlotys, according to <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawecka-Wlodarczak </PERSON>, the bank's foreign exchange manager. Her calculation was reported in Wednesday's edition of the government newspaper Rzeczpospolita. Uncertainty in the fledgling money market has forced those saving for big purchases to gamble on when to trade in their hard currency. `` Some people are panicking because they want to buy their apartments before Jan. 1, when the price per square meter is expected to go up,'' <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Socha </PERSON> explained as he waited in line at the bank. Dozens of other Poles who crowded around to add their thoughts on the money situation said that without sufficient goods and produce on the market to soak up the zlotys, the dollar's tumble is artificial and will soon correct itself. <PERSON> Tomasz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, an agricultural specialist, said farmers are holding back grain in hopes of being able to sell it later when prices and the value of the zloty are more stable. Economists are hoping that Western aid expected to arrive over the next few weeks will boost food supplies, stabilize prices and engender public confidence in the zloty.

 Tornadoes and torrential rain swept through the Deep South, damaging buildings and causing floods and at least two deaths, including a 3-year-old who was thrown 200 yards by a twister that blasted his family's mobile home. Tornadoes touched down Wednesday evening in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, and rains continued in already flooded parts of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, `` If there was a <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale for floods, this would have topped it,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Yenni </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. A 2-year-old boy there died when he fell into a drainage canal earlier this week. The 3-year-old and his parents were in a mobile home smashed by a tornado in <LOCATION> Pineview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, a town of 560 people. `` The child was found under a car 200 yards from the foundation of the trailer,'' said Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` Someone just happened to look under it and saw the baby.'' The child's name was unavailable. His father, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, was found lying in the road with a broken neck and was in critical condition early today, said <PERSON> Mandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shackleford </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>. The mother also was hurt. The tornado damaged at least four other homes and caused three additional injuries, authorities said. A tornado touched down near <LOCATION> Stonewall </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday night, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said, but no details were available. Two tornadoes hit two counties in southeast <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> on Wednesday morning. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a woman was hurt when her mobile home was tossed into a fish pond. Her husband paddled to the trailer in his boat to retrieve his wife and their daughter. `` It just all happened so fast,'' Mrs. E.C. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, 54, said in a telephone interview from her hospital bed. `` The trailer is still intact. It got picked up and was dropped in the pond. I'm fine, though.'' A tornado damaged more than 40 homes and businesses in the town of <LOCATION> Dothan </LOCATION>. `` This is the worst tornado I've seen in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 10 years,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Dothan-Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've found some roofs that were taken seven blocks away and dropped.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> opened a shelter for those left homeless or without power because of the storms. About 2,000 students at <ORGANIZATION> Wallace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> were kept in hallways for an hour during the worst of the storms and then were sent home. Several found their cars floating in a flooded parking lot. The weather service on Wednesday reported 5.6 inches of rain in Mobile, 9.6 inches in <LOCATION> Dothan </LOCATION>, and nearly 10 inches in <LOCATION> Florala </LOCATION>. More than 2,200 homes and businesses flooded after a record 17 inches of rain drenched <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and three surrounding parishes during a 24-hour period that ended Tuesday night, according to preliminary estimates. The rains continued in some areas Wednesday. Of the 1,400 homes in the <LOCATION> Ormond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estates </LOCATION> subdivision, 20 miles up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, 1,000 were flooded. Water was up to 2 feet deep in homes that cost from $ 100,000 to $ 500,000. Another 1,000 homes flooded in <LOCATION> Gretna </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> and parts of <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yenni </PERSON> said he would call for passage of a $ 100 million plan for major canal improvements and two more pumping stations in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> area, which is below sea level and relies on a network of drainage canals and pumps to protect neighborhoods from flooding. `` I can not believe this. I think I'm going to be sick. Brand new carpet ruined, everything ruined,'' said <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Arceneaux </PERSON>, who returned to her <ORGANIZATION> Ormond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION> house by boat to find 5 inches of water standing in the home.

<HEAD>Hindus Break Ground For Temple At Disputed Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> AYODHYA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Tens of thousands of militant Hindus stood guard today with tridents and bows and arrows as priests broke ground for a temple at a religious site claimed by both Hindus and Moslems. More than 1,000 Hindu pilgrims stood solemnly as four consecrated bricks passed over their heads and were placed on the ground as a symbol of the foundation they say they will begin digging Friday. Hundreds of security troops surrounded the disputed shrine, watched from rooftops and lined the roads leading to <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION>, a town of 35,000 people some 325 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The massive police and paramilitary presence indicated the lengths the government has taken to prevent violence between members of the two faiths. At least 290 people, mostly Moslems, have been killed in religious riots across other parts of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> because of plans to build the temple. If ever completed, the temple would engulf a disputed 17th century shrine claimed by followers of both religions. Moslems, who comprise 11 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people, say the shrine is the Babri Masjid, or mosque of the Moghal emperor <PERSON> Babar </PERSON>. Hindus, who comprise 82 percent of the population, claim the mosque was built over the birthplace of the Lord Ram, an incarnation of <PERSON> Vishnu </PERSON>, one of the supreme trinity of gods. The dispute over the squat, white buildings with three domes dates back to the 19th century but erupted afresh in August after the militant Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hindus </ORGANIZATION>, announced plans to build a new temple. The ceremony prompted the government to put police and the army on a state of alert across northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Additional forces were patrolling cities with significant Moslem populations, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said on condition of anonymity. The issue also has become a focal point for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s general elections, scheduled for Nov. 22, 24 and 26. Asked if construction would begin before the elections, <PERSON> Surya </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON>, joint secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Vishwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parishad </ORGANIZATION>, replied: `` Within a month.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who faces a strong challenge for re-election from an opposition coalition, is unwilling to risk alienating the majority Hindus. He is equally unwilling to risk the minority Moslem votes, which traditionally have gone in favor of his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vishwanah </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, leader of the opposition coalition, has also avoided taking sides on the dispute. Both have urged moderation and tolerance by members of both faiths, without giving any specific suggestions on how to resolve the problem. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> had planned to be in <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION> on today to try to keep tensions from boiling into violence. However, he remained in the town of <LOCATION> Faizabad </LOCATION>, about four miles away. Asked why, he replied, `` This is part of <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION>.''

 <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, struggling against alcoholism, was hospitalized for severe reactions to rubbing alcohol, which she drank while exhausted because of flu and depression, her doctor said. The wife of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been taking anti-depressants prescribed by her psychiatrist, but tests showed the rubbing alcohol caused her hospitalization, said Dr. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, the family physician. Some specialists in treating alcoholism characterized Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' action as a `` desperate cry for help.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> family removed all alcoholic beverages from their home after Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> entered a treatment program for alcoholism last February, said <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON>, the governor's spokeswoman. <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> did not comment Wednesday on whether Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had knowingly tried to hurt herself or was seeking the effects of alcohol when she drank a small amount of the poisonous substance Monday. The former Democratic presidential candidate spent Monday and Tuesday at his wife's side, canceled all appointments, and refused to comment. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who turns 53 next month, was taken by ambulance to the hospital on the eve of the first anniversary of her husband's presidential defeat `` Autumn has been a particularly bad season for her,'' said <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>. `` Kitty has suffered from chemical dependency and struggled with depression for many years. These two problems often are related.'' She was admitted to the intensive care unit at <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital complaining of what a spokeswoman said were `` flu-like symptoms.'' On Wednesday, she was moved to a private room. <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON> said Wednesday night she did not know how long Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be hospitalized. Rubbing alcohol is normally about 70 percent isopropyl alcohol, which is much more toxic than ethanol, or drinking liquor, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Isopropyl alcohol can damage the stomach and about 10 ounces of it could be lethal, <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> said. It is not uncommon for alcoholics to drink rubbing alcohol if nothing else is available, but specialists in alcholism treatment said such behavior was more likely to be seen among impoverished street alcoholics than affluent drinkers. `` Usually it's somebody with a severe alcohol problem,'' said a woman at the <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> 24-Hour Hotline who declined to give her name. `` They'll drink anything, even hair spray.'' Others said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' behavior could hardly be interpreted simply as an effort to get a drink. `` It seems like a desperate cry for help, really,'' said <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON>, director of an alcoholism detoxification program at <ORGANIZATION> Andrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. In February, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> entered a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> alcoholism treatment center for four weeks of therapy. She previously said she overcame a 26-year addiction to diet pills. In October, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> participated in an Outward Bound rafting and camping expedition in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, `` a great experience that suggested falsely that this fall might not be so bad,'' <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said. He said she had been keeping a hectic public speaking schedule and was exhausted when she returned from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> a week ago today. Others said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> may have stretched her nerves by making too public a recovery from her problems. `` I think it's very difficult to try to manage a recovery in the public spotlight,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Domenic </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciraulo </PERSON>, substance abuse consultant at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The Dukakises were married in 1963 and have always lived in suburban <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, where they grew up. They have three grown children and a granddaughter. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 86-year-old mother, Euterpe, also was hospitalized Monday. She was in satisfactory condition Wednesday at <LOCATION> Beth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where she was admitted after a bout of fainting spells. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has faced a difficult season, aggravated by the dissolution of what had been touted as the state's economic miracle. As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> visited his wife Wednesday night, weary legislators had their hands full, debating cuts into an already lean state budget to offset a $ 720 million shortfall. His four-year term ends in 1991. He has said he wo n't seek re-election.

<HEAD>Oscar-Winner Cleared for Top-Secret Films</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Actor <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> is in demand by government producers who value his top-secret nuclear weapons security clearance as much as his Academy Award. For six years <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> has held the nation's highest-level security clearance because of his no-fee work narrating classified instructional films and videotapes for the government. And the actor who claimed the Oscar for best actor in 1959 for his work in `` Ben Hur'' knows what possessing the top security clearance means: Keep quiet. `` I'm not trying to be dramatically secretive or anything,'' <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> said. `` But I ca n't get into that.'' About 28,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and defense contractor employees involved in nuclear weapons programs have the clearance that <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> has, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said. He has worked on at least six highly classified productions, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The latest was a video titled `` Trust but Verify,'' which reportedly showed both Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high-tech nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>, a staunch Republican and former six-term president of the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, says the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is n't the only government agency he's worked for, but he wo n't say what the other agencies are. `` I do work for other agencies from time to time,'' he said. `` Most of the stuff that you do in this area is not designed for public consumption.'' The actor's film credits include `` The Ten Commandments,'' `` The Agony and the Ecstasy,'' and `` Planet of the Apes'' and `` The Three Musketeers'' series.

 A cyclone battered <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s southwestern coast <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> today, killing at least 11 people and leaving thousands homeless as it uprooted trees and blew away hundreds of thatched huts, news reports said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said the storm ravaged the district of <LOCATION> Nellore </LOCATION>, 900 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The agency quoted unidentified government officials as saying at least 11 people were killed in the storm. Further details of damage were not available because it had cut off communication links, it said. The cyclone blew across the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> after killing at least 169 people in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> last week as Typhoon Gay. It crossed the coast at <LOCATION> Nellore </LOCATION>, a district of 2.2 million people, at 1:30 a.m. today, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. The news agency said trains in the area were halted after strong winds blew down trees and damaged railroad tracks. <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, another news agency, said the military had been alerted for rescue efforts and people were evacuated from the coastal regions. The storm hit <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> on Friday, and authorities in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said at least 111 people were killed on the mainland and another 58 drowned at sea. Another 447 people, mostly fishermen out on the Gulf of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, have been reported missing.

<TEXT>
 The dollar was mixed in early European trading today, and gold was higher. Dealers expressed some surprise that the dollar was holding up despite a quarter-point drop in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Federal Fund rate and recent rate hikes in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Star Tribune Guild Gives Lackluster Approval To Six-Year Deal</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> newsroom workers averted a strike by approving a six-year contract, but a union leader called the new pact a `` rotten deal.'' The Twin Cities Newspaper Guild approved the pact Wednesday night, hours after their second strike deadline passed in as many days. Guild Chairwoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON> said the vote was 233-70. The contract includes lump-sum bonuses in each of the first three years, and pay raises of 3.2 percent in the fourth year, 3.1 percent in the fifth year and 3.0 percent in the sixth year, union officials said. Union leaders said they recommended approval because other unions at the plant were reluctant to support a strike, <ORGANIZATION> Many </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> members feared they would be replaced in a prolonged strike, they said. `` It's a bad deal. It's a rotten deal,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, vice chair of the workers' negotiating committee. `` It simply does n't meet the needs of people trying to keep their standard of living intact,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, strike coordinator for the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> unit of the Guild. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennison </PERSON>, vice president of labor relations for the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, said the company succeeded in its goal to freeze wage scales for three years. But he said the company also `` made an effort to accommodate some key needs of the Guild.'' `` Sometimes you have a feeling you did n't get everything you wanted,'' <PERSON> Dennison </PERSON> said. `` But both sides can walk away with their head up.'' For top scale reporters, photographers, copy editors and district circulation managers, the bonuses will be $ 2,000 in the first year, $ 1,750 in the second and $ 1,500 in the third, <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennison </PERSON> said. The pay raises for top-scale employees will amount to about $ 26 a week in each of the last three years, they said. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said the package averages out to a 1.6 percent annual increase in pay scales over six years. He called it `` worse by far'' than the deal struck by <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> employees at the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> -RRB- Pioneer Press Dispatch earlier this year. For the first three years of the new pact, top minimum weekly salaries for <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> members will remain at $ 315.50 for copy aides; $ 742.50 for circulation district managers; $ 812 for reporters, photographers, copy editors and promotion personnel; and $ 895.75 for some editors. The <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> unit has been working without a contract since its three-year pact expired July 31. The unit covers about 300 newsroom employees and about 60 circulation and promotion workers.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats are attacking the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's willingness to accept automatic budget cuts that would force the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to reduce the nation's armed forces. `` It would be a disaster if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration decide to go over the cliff,'' Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday as <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials described the impact of automatic reductions on the four military branches The 2.1 million active duty armed forces would have to be reduced by about 229,000 in fiscal 1990 under the cuts, with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> cut by 80,000, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> by 76,000, the Army by 62,000 and the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> by 11,000. Military contracts for such big-ticket items as the multiple-warhead MX nuclear missile and the Advanced Tactical Fighter would also have to be renegotiated, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The automatic budget cuts are necessary because of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' failure to pass a deficit reconciliation bill aimed at complying with the budget-cutting requirements of the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would be willing to live with the cutbacks in fiscal 1990 rather than accept a budget reconciliation bill that does not result in real deficit reductions. The president is seeking $ 14 billion in cuts; <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has indicated a $ 12 billion cut is possible. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators are still thrashing out reconciliation legislation. Without the legislation, federal programs would suffer $ 16.1 billion in automatic cuts, with half targeting the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> invited <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to describe the impact of the automatic budget cuts. At the session, however, members of the panel fell into partisan bickering. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., said he could not believe that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` the great defender of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' would accept the defense reductions that would be `` absolutely devastating'' to the military `` The effect of this decision would be to take us back to the readiness levels of the mid-1970s,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn., who indicated that the `` zillions of dollars'' spent during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations on building up the nation's defense would be for naught But Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the committee, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must share some of the blame. `` We're in this hearing because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> failed to do its job,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We've got a lot of faults. We did n't come into this with clean hands.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, shrugged off the concerns expressed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, and told reporters the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is `` not paralyzed with fear like the last administration was'' over the automatic cuts. Rep. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, R-Calif., said that if `` defense had more flexibility,'' he would favor the required budget cuts During the session, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s comptroller, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON>, and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> described the steps they would have to take in response to the 4.3 percent across-the-board cuts. <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> request that would give them the authority to move money around to minimize the effect of the automatic budget cuts. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he supports that request but indicated other congressional committees oppose the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s call and the likelihood of approval is slim. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> will comply with the budget cuts `` however painful that may be,'' <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> said.

 Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> today resigned from his last <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> post, as head of the powerful military commission, and cleared the way for his chosen successor to assume undisputed power. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 85, was replaced by the protege, 63-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The move was approved by the ruling party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in a meeting that ended today. The committee also issued a communique warning that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must go through at least two more years of economic austerity to overcome current problems of inflation, excessive growth and corruption. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> announced <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s resignation. The architect of Chinese policy for the past decade, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has been seeking to make way for a new generation of leaders centered around <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> though apparently meeting some resistance from President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> and his allies. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who has served <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Communist cause for six decades, resigned from the party's ruling Politburo and other top party posts in 1987 but is still recognized as the ultimate source of power in the country. In a Nov. 7 letter to the Politburo carried by <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> he said giving up the last post while still healthy was his `` long-cherished desire.'' In the letter, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> expressed his confidence in the new party chief, saying party leaders had in June elected `` a leading nucleus headed by Comrade <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> and it is now already carrying out its work effectively.'' He said he would now seek to resign from the less important government body whose functions parallel the party military commission, which sets policy for the armed forces. President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, 82, was named the party military commission's first vice chairman, a job left vacant when former party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> was stripped of all leadership posts for tolerating the pro-democracy movement The committee's communique did not mention <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who has been under house arrest. There had been speculation that the plenum might recommend criminal charges against <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> or remove <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> supporters from their offices. The changes for now end the power struggle diplomatic sources have reported between <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, who had been the commission's vice chairman, and younger party leaders. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, a hard-liner, reportedly sought to solidify his place in the post-Deng era by winning the chairmanship, but other senior party members apparently felt the post should be given to <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> was one of the principal leaders behind the decision to declare martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and bring in troops to crush the pro-democracy movement. Soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in a June 4 assault. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Baibing </PERSON>, the political boss of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, was named secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The army's chief of staff, <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Haotian </PERSON>, is said to be <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s son-in-law, and there has reportedly been opposition to what appeared <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s attempt to establish a family dynasty within the military <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Huaqing </PERSON>, formerly deputy secretary general of the commission and former head of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>, was named the commission's second vice chairman. `` Basically, it looks like a compromise,'' a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-based </LOCATION> diplomat said of the changes, with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> getting his way regarding the chairmanship and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> getting his way regarding his brother. When asked if <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> could use the position to develop a power base in the military, the diplomat said: `` If <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> dies, he -LRB- <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> -RRB- has no chance ... I do n't think the position makes any difference whatsoever.'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> was named party chief June 24 with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s backing. He had been party boss of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, the country's largest city, but lacks a national power base. The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the new commission lineup indicates `` nothing's been really resolved'' in the struggle to succeed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. `` There is no clear sign one way or the other.'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> declared: `` Our cause of reform and opening to the outside world has just started. We have arduous tasks ahead and there will be some twists and turns on our way of advance. But I firmly believe that we will be able to overcome various difficulties and carry forward the cause pioneered by our predecessors from generation to generation.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was purged twice by radicals during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, then staged a comeback that turned <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> around beginning in 1978. Under <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, living standards have improved for tens of millions of Chinese. He also opened the country to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as part of his drive for modernization. But the harsh suppression of the spring pro-democracy movement showed that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was not willing to loosen the party's firm grip on politics.

 A van carrying immigrant factory workers to their jobs in the suburbs skidded off a damp highway in heavy fog, crashed into a tree and exploded. Seven people died and eight others were injured, two critically. Police said the driver told investigators the van blew a tire before veering out of control just before dawn Wednesday on the Northern State Parkway. `` It was wet and extremely slippery. It's like driving on ice,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> investigator <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Faro </PERSON>. `` Frankly, I'm amazed that we did n't have more killed.'' The van's occupants, all Haitian, lived in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and worked in factories on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where there has been a shortage of workers for entry-level jobs. They spoke little English, complicating the investigation, police said. Police said they were investigating whether the van, registered as a passenger vehicle, was being used illegally as a van for hire or legally as a car pool. Police also were questioning the van's driver, who apparently did not have a valid <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> driver's license, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. Five people were dead at the scene and two others died later of their injuries, authorities said. Killed were four men, two women and one person whose sex could not be determined. Two of the injured were in critical condition and the six others were in fair to serious condition. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Siraucia </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetics </ORGANIZATION>, said that two of the workers in the van, including one of those who died, had worked for him for about two years. `` They were just good, hard-working people,'' he said.

 Complaints about homeless people at the nation's busiest airport have prompted a plan to move them to shelters But advocates for the homeless are criticizing the idea. The strategy, still in its formative stages, would clear the homeless out of <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> through nightly sweeps. `` I would n't go,'' said a diminutive, white-haired woman, who gave her name as <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>. `` It's no solution. It's too short-term because you're only there for a short time and then you're back on the street, and I know about these things.'' One of about 200 who live at the airport, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> said Wednesday night she hustles baggage carts to make money. She sneaks up behind airline passengers, waits for them to take the bags off their rented carts, then sneaks off to return the rental. Each returned cart makes her 25 cents. Ten carts buy her a hot dog. `` See that guy? He's been doing it 11 years,'' she said, pointing out an older man who slipped into a side entrance of a terminal's cafeteria as the lights were turned off for the evening. A <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> policeman closed the door behind him. `` The city offers them free housing and programs downtown ... but they can make a ton of money out here'' by returning carts, stealing luggage and recruiting passengers for limousine services, said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a 24-year-old former fast-food restaurant worker who began living at the airport two weeks ago when he lost his apartment, disagreed. `` There's a lot of people here who do n't have a place to go,'' he said. `` At least at a shelter they'll have a bed and a hot meal. I know I want to go somewhere, not just stay here.'' Complaints provoked <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Aviation Commissioner <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Franke </PERSON> to set aside $ 500,000 out of the $ 350 million annual airport operations budget to deal with the homeless problem. Ideas include closing the airport for a short time in the early morning hours, rounding up those who appear to be homeless, and taking them to a shelter in the surrounding suburbs. `` Airports all over the country routinely close in the middle of the night for a variety of reasons, sometimes for the removal of live-ins,'' <PERSON> Franke </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` But there's no plan in place, no dates, no deadlines, no nothing.'' Elsewhere, efforts have been tried to clear the homeless from public property. For example, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> recently, as the number of homeless people and the number of complaints about them have continued to rise, officials have adopted codes of conduct in public spaces and erected barriers that close off areas frequented by the homeless. The O'Hare plan, endorsed by Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, needs <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approval. But suburbs surrounding <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> have denounced a plan to build a shelter or to bus the homeless there. `` Everybody complains about the homeless at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> ... and the minute you go to develop a program people complain about that,'' <PERSON> Franke </PERSON> said. `` It appears it's impossible to please everyone.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, historically opposed to random sweeps of any kind, said it is monitoring the issue and would examine the plan's legality when it is proposed. And advocates for the homeless say the plan could be discriminatory. `` It'll all be based on what somebody looks like,'' said <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Non-Violence </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. Still, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> praised those who want to take the homeless to a shelter rather than just evict them. `` It's better than saying, ` Why do n't we drive these people out of here?''' he said. `` It's a more progressive response.''

 A Danish ferry with more than 370 aboard limped into harbor today after a freighter struck it from behind in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, killing three passengers and injuring 11 other people, officials said. Witnesses said parts of the dance lounge of the passenger ferry <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> were hanging out of a 60-foot gash in the hull after the Wednesday night collision with the Nordic Stream. The freighter's deck was littered with cocktail chairs from the ferry By coincidence, the lounge was almost empty when the crash occurred because the conductor of the ship's band was feeling sick and had delayed a scheduled evening dance by half an hour, said officials with ferry owner Scandinavian Seaways. The ferry was traveling from <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Harwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> when it was struck. Six seriously injured people were taken by helicopter from the ferry after the accident south of the island of <LOCATION> Helgoland </LOCATION>, said an official with ferry owner Danish Scandinavian Seaways. The official, <PERSON> Hardwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheel </PERSON>, said in a radio interview that experts in <LOCATION> Bremerhaven </LOCATION> were investigating how the huge ferry, carrying 277 passengers and 96 crew members, was struck by the Nordic Stream, a container ship. Scandinavian Seaways said the 170-foot ferry, with a capacity of 1,000 people, was struck above and below the water line in the area of the ship's lounge where people were relaxing. Eleven people are known to have been hurt, of which five remained hospitalized Thursday, <PERSON> Scheel </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, revising an earlier report of 15 injuries. He said the identities of the dead were not confirmed but that they appeared to be two Britons and a German. Scandinavian Seaways said the passengers included 60 Britons, 192 Germans, 16 <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> and nine others of unidentified nationality. The <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> has a gross registered tonnage of 13,141. The 8,026-ton Nordic Stream sails under Panamanian registry. The West German sea rescue station in <LOCATION> Cuxhaven </LOCATION> said the accident occurred at 10:16 p.m. as the <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> was steaming out to sea and the Nordic Stream was heading toward the <LOCATION> Elbe </LOCATION> channel in the direction of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> harbor. Officials said a storm warning was in effect at the time of the accident with high winds and rough seas. Rescue officials said evacuation of the injured had been hampered by the bad weather. The ferry sails every two days between <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Harwich </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>$50 Million Judgment Against Bank of America Reversed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A state appeals court threw out a $ 50 million judgment won by a farmer who said a bank defrauded him by enticing him to borrow millions and then cutting off credit when his business went sour. In a ruling seen as a victory for banks on the issue of `` lender liability,'' the court Wednesday said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanghellini </PERSON> failed to prove the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> committed fraud. A jury in 1987 awarded <PERSON> Stanghellini </PERSON>, his elderly mother and aunt $ 20 million in compensatory damages and $ 30 million in punitive damages. The award was reduced by $ 3 million, the amount Stanghellini owed the bank. <PERSON> Stanghellini </PERSON> had argued that the bank got him to borrow heavily to expand and then cut him off after his tomato-growing business suffered heavy losses in the early 1980s. The appeals court cited errors by the trial judge and misconduct by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stanghellini </PERSON>'s lawyer. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> had tried to `` vilify the bank unfairly, both in and out of court'' make his case `` through sources beyond properly admissible evidence,'' the court said. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was unavailable for comment, a spokeswoman said Wednesday. Recent decisions by appeals courts have reversed several rulings against banks that abruptly cut off credit to long-standing customers who began losing money.

<HEAD>President Tells White Extremists Reforms Will Continue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President F.W. de Klerk today told leaders of two white extremist groups that he rejected their proposal for a whites-only homeland and will continue to pursue power-sharing with blacks. The meeting was the first ever between a South African head of state and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>, leader of the neo-Nazi <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. It is the country's most powerful white-supremacist group. <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>, who wore a khaki uniform to the hourlong meeting, was accompanied by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonder </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Boerestaat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Both organizations advocate creation of a whites-only nation in the northeastern third of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, to be controlled by the Afrikaners who make up 60 percent of the country's 5 million white population. `` I do n't think the proposals of those two parties are realistic or very workable,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, also an Afrikaner, told a news conference after the meeting. `` I sincerely believe <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> does not represent a substantial number of people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> declined comment and left the president's office in the company of 10 bodyguards in khaki uniforms bearing the movement's swastika-like emblem. He was expected to talk about the meeting at a speech scheduled for tonight in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, a Johannesburg-area industrial town controlled by the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The president said <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> did not warn that his movement might take up arms against the government. But, `` should revolutionary forces be allowed to take over, they would take up arms,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> and <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonder </PERSON> also expressed concern about the possible consequences of releasing prominent black security prisoners, such as jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The meeting was requested by <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>, a charismatic orator who often ends his speeches with Hitler-style salutes. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who took office in mid-August, has offered to meet leaders across the political spectrum. He conferred last month with three prominent anti-apartheid church leaders, including Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION>, provincial capital of the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, seven members of <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>'s movement went on trial today for allegedly tar-and-feathering Mayor <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Gouws </PERSON> of the town of <LOCATION> Welkom </LOCATION> because he permitted a multiracial foot race. Also today, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said government reform moves are being undercut by action against the news media and a threat to suspend a leading anti-apartheid newspaper. Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Louw </PERSON> has accused the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of `` promoting the public image'' of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and warned the newspaper it could face a suspension of up to three months. The weekly newspaper, published by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, was shut down for three months in 1988 but maintained an aggressive anti-government stance after returning to newsstands. `` The South African government is mounting a campaign against the press,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlangeni </PERSON>, one of seven <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders released from prison last month. Such a crackdown will undermine any government attempt to create a `` climate that can make meaningful negotiations possible,'' <PERSON> Mlangeni </PERSON> said on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders. Under state of emergency regulations the government has wide powers of censorship and may close publications for up to three months without having to justify its action in court.

Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> contingent that is monitoring the elections have cited the alliance for several possible infractions of the election code, including incidents of intimidation and the display of party posters too close to polling stations. <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roux </PERSON>, a spokesman for the territorial government, said today that 60.4 percent of the 701,483 registered voters had cast ballots Tuesday and Wednesday. `` This is quite remarkable _ a figure that speaks well not only of the system but of the enthusiasm of the Namibian people,'' <PERSON> Roux </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roux </PERSON> earlier predicted that the turnout could approach 100 percent by the time voting ends Saturday. Namibians, many of them first-time voters, are electing a 72-seat assembly that will write a constitution and make <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> after 74 years. Voters have been willing to wait for hours in temperatures up to 108 degrees to cast their ballots. Election officials said results could be released by Wednesday. Assembly seats will be allocated according to the proportion of votes received by each party, and the assembly is to convene one week after the results are final. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, a leftist movement which waged a 23-year war against South African rule, could write the constitution on its own if it wins two-thirds of the assembly seats. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy, was part of the transitional government installed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Also today, authorities launched a search for a missing reporter from The Republican, a <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> newspaper published by the alliance. The reporter, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Erastus </PERSON>, was last seen Monday and his abandoned car was found later near <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s northern border with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> captured the vast, mineral-rich territory from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War I.

 <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, premier for the past six years, was sworn in as president today in a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> ceremony boycotted by opposition parties. He named <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbulut </PERSON>, speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, as the new premier. In his inaugural address, <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said one of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s main aims should be `` to occupy its distinguished place in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>,'' and he called for reform he said is necessary to become an <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> member. All 155 opposition deputies also stayed away from the 450-seat <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> was elected president Oct. 31. All but 20 of the 283 deputies of <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> voted for him. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, 62, swore to be free of all bias and to uphold the secular republic, all its laws and democracy. Cannons fired 101 salvos to mark his inauguration. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> proposed that a standing committee on human rights be established in the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and that judicial reform be undertaken. The appointment of <PERSON> Akbulut </PERSON>, a member of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who has served as speaker since 1987, came as a surprise. He had not been mentioned among the frontrunners for the job. Parliament must approve the appointment and is likely to vote next week. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> appointed the 54-year-old lawyer apparently because he was hard-pressed to find a candidate acceptable to all factions of the party that includes liberals, Moslem fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists, political analysts said. The premier-designate is considered a moderate and exteremely loyal to <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>. He served as interior minister in one of <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s Cabinets before the 1987 general election <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> succeeds <PERSON> Kenan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evren </PERSON>, leader of a 1980 military coup. In a speech at a second ceremony, <PERSON> Evren </PERSON> proposed that the constitution be changed to allow voters to elect the president directly. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> sought and won the presidency at a time when popular support for his free-market policies had plummeted to about 17 percent, according to recent public opinion polls. The opposition, which includes the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the centrist <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led by former premier <PERSON> Suleyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Demirel </PERSON>, contended that <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> lacked a popular mandate and could not be the nonpartisan president required by the constitution. The presidency is a highly respected post but has little executive power. He can veto legislation but <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> can overturn his vetoes. He can refuse to appoint Cabinet ministers suggested by the premier, but this authority has been used sparingly in the past. However, <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s successor as premier is hand-picked, and he remains the power in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> served as premier after his <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won the 1983 general elections that ended three years of military rule. He is credited with the success of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s 1980 economic rescue program and liberalization that brought export-led growth.

<HEAD>Moslem Fundamentalists Score Major Electoral Victory</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Moslem fundamentalists scored a major victory today in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s first general election in 22 years, capturing at least 26 seats in an 80-member Parliament. Former government officials faired poorly. The Islamic fundamentalists, who call for stricter Moslem laws and the elimination of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, swamped their opponents in districts throughout the country, according to early results. The victory appeared to be a setback for King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, who had appealed to voters to separate religion from politics. Islamic activists and leftists easily outnumber declared pro-government deputies. Among the victors was <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> <PERSON> Murad </PERSON>, convicted in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> of participating in the 1969 grenade attack by Palestinian guerrillas on the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> office of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s state airline, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON>, that killed a child and wounded 14 other people. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> freed him in 1970 to win the freedom of 55 hostages aboard a hijacked Olympic Airways jetliner. <PERSON> Murad </PERSON> edged a member of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> to win the seat in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>'s 3rd District reserved for Circassians, a group of 19th century Caucasian refugees who settled in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Most results had been officially reported this afternoon, but those for several large districts remained unclear. Official announcements gave the Moslem Brotherhood 19 seats and they were expected to pick up another five when all results were tallied. Independent Islamic activists, some allied with the Brotherhood, won seven seats and were expected to pick up about three more. Although parties have been banned in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> since 1957, the government allowed the Brotherhood to operate as a charitable organization, in part to counter the influence of leftist groups. Radical leftists won only four to five seats and leftist <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nationalists at least nine. Pro-government figures, tribal leaders and centrists got about 20 seats and were likely to pick up a few more. More than 62 percent of the 877,000 eligible voters cast ballots, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Salameh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> said. The elections involved 647 candidates, including 12 women who were able to vote and seek office for the first time. None seemed likely to win. Women's rights activist <PERSON> Toujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON>, who won international attention when Islamic fundamentalists filed a lawsuit accusing her of abandoning her faith, was trounced 4-1 by a Moslem Brotherhood candidate. Several prominent pro-government figures were defeated, including former Public Works Minister <PERSON> Shafiq </PERSON> <PERSON> Zawaideh </PERSON> and former Industry Minister <PERSON> Hamdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabaa </PERSON>. By far the biggest winners appeared to be Brotherhood candidates. `` The people want Islam and it is not strange for our country and our people to have such a large number of Moslem candidates winning,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghanimeh </PERSON>. The last nationwide election occurred in April 1967, two months before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, represented by half the deputies in the old <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. It was the first nationwide election since <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> renounced claims on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The Parliament must pass all laws and budgets and can reject cabinets _ something previous legislatures have done several times in the past. The king remains the center of authority. He can dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> at any time and for 22 years has ruled by martial law.

<TEXT>
 Former crewmen of a oil-drilling ship that capsized during a typhoon said the flat-bottomed vessel was not fit for rough weather. The ship's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> owners blamed faulty weather forecasting. The 5,373-ton Panamanian-flagged <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON>, operated by <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, overturned Friday as Typhoon Gay rolled through the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, killing more than 300 people. The storm was the worst to hit the country in 35 years. Only six of the 97 people aboard <LOCATION> Seacrest </LOCATION> are known to have survived the typhoon. Twenty-five bodies have been found, but the rest of the crew remains missing. All seven American crew members were feared dead. `` That drill ship was made for moderate tropical waters _ it was never designed to withstand the sort of excessive seas that it took on Friday,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>, a crewman on the <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON> for 10 years. He said he was called to help in the rescue operation because of his knowledge of the ship's layout. <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>, another <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON> crewman and relatives of men lost aboard the ship also accused Unocal of disregarding weather forecasts and of failing to mount effective rescue efforts. The <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> reported today that some relatives of missing or dead crewmen were considering legal action against <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> has denied the <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON> was unseaworthy. Senior company executives have cited poor weather forcasting as a reason for the loss of the ship and admitted some shortcomings in rescue attempts. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Imle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thailand </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference Wednesday no company boats were able to approach the <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON> until about eight hours after it capsized. The Nation quoted <PERSON> Kriangkrai </PERSON> <PERSON> Korwattana </PERSON>, head of the meteorological center in the southern port of <LOCATION> Songkhla </LOCATION>, as saying <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> had ignored repeated storm warnings. `` They had three days to decide what to do,'' he was quoted as saying. The other former <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON> crewman, a relative of a man missing in the disaster, accused Unocal of being complacent about weather conditions in the normally calm gulf. `` If this was the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> the safety standards would be very different,'' he said. The <PERSON> Seacrest </PERSON> capsized in the <LOCATION> Platong </LOCATION> field, one of several being explored for natural gas by <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The Sandinista government enters bargaining with the Contras today with an offer to free all political prisoners _ but only after half the rebel force is dismantled and all Sandinista captives are freed. The leftist government's revised plan for disbanding the U.S.-backed rebels offers few new elements. It goes part of the way toward meeting Contra demands, but carries a threat of renewed war. At the heart of the talks is a 3-month-old regional pact to demobilize the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> force _ about 12,000 fighters based in jungle camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> _ by Dec. 5. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is determined the deadline be met. National elections are scheduled for next Feb. 25 and could be at risk if fighting resumes after 19 months of relative quiet. The negotiations are taking place at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and include a joint U.N.-Organization of American States commission as well as Sandinista and Contra delegates. The commission was set up by the Aug. 7 peace accord signed in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and four other Central American presidents. Its mission is to supervise and verify the demobilization. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> today, the Contras announced the formation of a new `` civilian-military commission'' to act as the governing body in place of the old directorate, several of whose members have returned to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Contra spokesman <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> negotiating team headed by the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION>'s military commander, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, has recognized the new commission, which includes only one of the former directors, <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>. As part of the peace accord, in exchange for the dissolution of the Contras, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> moved up the election date from 1991 and pledged free and fair campaigning and balloting under the supervision of international observers. The most significant items in the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' new 15-point proposal were an offer to release all political prisoners and a statement guaranteeing the Contras their human and civil rights. Even so, these offers are conditional. The political prisoners would be released only after half the Contra force has been demobilized and after all Nicaraguans claimed by the Sandinistas to have been kidnapped by the rebels have been freed. Similarly, the human and civil rights guarantee is for those rebels who lay down their arms and return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Contra leaders say they distrust Sandinista promises. They demand an unconditional general amnesty and so far have made no move to demobilize. Among nine point in the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> proposal that are not new is one urging the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to put toward Contra demobilization the non-lethal aid it has approved to maintain the rebels as a fighting force. `` If the Contras do n't accept this plan, they will be voting for war,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told a news conference. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> also have offered to suspend arms imports until April 25. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said in May it stopped shipping arms to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at the end of 1988, but <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfowitz </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary, said last week that other Soviet bloc nations and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have continued sending weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have also offered to reinstate the cease-fire <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> suspended on Nov. 1 and to withdraw the huge military machinery the government has since deployed so Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> can return to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The reverse of this offer is that if the Contras do n't agree to demobilize, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> could launch an offensive to wipe out the 6,500 Contras the government says are in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, 4,000 of whom are said to have infiltrated in the past month. Stepped up fighting could make campaigning for the elections difficult if not impossible in many places. And disrupted balloting could fuel opposition claims that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> were never serious about free elections. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is sending a 625-member border patrol force to stop the Contra infiltration from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and to interdict shipments of Nicaraguan and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> weapons the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says are being made to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The pact that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> signed calls for the `` voluntary'' demobilization of the rebels force, but the Contras were not a party to the agreement. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, the only party that could force the Contras off its territory, rejected <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s invitation to take part in the negotiations, saying it never has recognized the Contras legally as an insurgent force. It later relented and sent a delegation to the talks, but only as observers. By attending only as an observer, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> apparently hopes to project an image of cooperation in the regional peace effort while avoiding a decision on the Contras and possibly angering its ally, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, also was to attend as an observer. He is the only figure in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> whose moral authority is recognized and respected by both sides. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has told his negotiating team it must not leave the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> meeting without a signed accord.

 A consumer health group today asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to revoke an agreement between a cigarette manufacturer and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> which the group says `` smears the Bill of Rights with the blood of all Americans killed as a result of smoking.'' The August agreement makes <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> part of an Archives campaign to commemorate the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights. A nationally televised public service announcement that is a part of the campaign includes the voices of President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> over images of the Bill of Rights and scenes from civil rights demonstrations. The announcement identifies <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> as the sponsor. `` This joint venture smears the Bill of Rights with the blood of all Americans killed as a result of smoking Marlboro and other <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> cigarettes,'' said <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, in a letter to Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Democrat, heads the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on government information which has jurisdiction over the archives. `` The campaign has nothing to do with cigarettes. It's about the celebration of the Bill of Rights,'' <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, vice president of corporate affairs for <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, said today. We are only identified at the very end -LRB- of the announcement -RRB- and we consciously separated the identification of the company from the messages about the themes of the Bill of Rights,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` We're just sponsoring the messages and the archives is helping us to make sure they're historically accurate.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> added that as of this morning, 200,056 people had requested a copy of the Bill of Rights offered by <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. `` The Bill of Rights belongs to everybody,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, likening his company's sponsorship of the campaign to that of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> raising money to refurbish the Statue of Liberty. Efforts to reach national archivist <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> by telephone were unsuccessful. The agreement is the first such cooperative effort and `` launches the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>' endeavor to engage the corporate world in supporting events related to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s documentary heritage,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said in a Nov. 1 announcement. The agreement with <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> allows the company to `` obscure its deadly role in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and worldwide society'' and should be reversed, said <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in 1971 with consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>. Under the agreement, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> donates $ 600,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and is permitted to publish or broadcast announcements as part of the Bill of Rights bicentennial commemoration, using voices of prominent Americans such as former presidents. `` What would <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> or <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> think if they knew their voices were being made available by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> in order to improve the image of a company with the deadly record of <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>?'' asked <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> in his letter. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said Archives staff have told him $ 475,000 of the company's contribution will go to build an exhibit gallery in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> building and the remaining $ 125,000 will give the company the first charter membership in an association, yet to be established, that will solicit corporate donations to do the work of the Archives.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has ordered deodorant makers to give up smog-forming aerosol propellants or find a way to reduce the pollution they create. `` This landmark action requires manufacturers to use more environmentally acceptable substitutes if they choose to continue selling aerosols and will likely set a precedent for other consumer product actions that follow,'' <PERSON> Jananne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpless </PERSON>, chairwoman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement. Manufacturers and industry experts said the move against underarm sprays could open the door to restrictions on other aerosol products such as hair spray and prompt some manufacturers to pull their products out of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Hydrocarbons are used as a propellant to spray many products. They became popular after 1978 when chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, were banned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of their danger to the ozone layer. Hydrocarbons cause no known damage to the ozone but combine with other pollutants to create smog. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday gave manufacturers of antiperspirants and deodorants until 1992 to reduce smog-creating hydrocarbons by 20 percent. The order also calls for an additional 60 percent cut by 1995. Manufacturers will be given the option of providing a plan to comply with the ruling by 1999, using yet-to-be developed products that spray without polluting. The delay will allow time for safety testing. The board suggested the use of substitute propellants and such mechanical features as pumps. The order could lead manufacturers to concentrate on sales of roll-on and solid antiperspirants and deodorants, which account for 75 percent of sales in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` There already are more environmentally acceptable alternatives for aerosol deodorants that are being purchased by three out of every four Californians,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sharpless </PERSON> said. Manufacturers said they were not sure of the ruling's impact but suggested board members were opening the way for restrictions on other products. `` Their intention is to ban aerosols. This is step No. 1. The only reason they are n't putting an outright ban is because there would be a hundred lawsuits,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON>, president of Diversified <ORGANIZATION> CPC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturer based in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Haiden </PERSON>, an economic consultant from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said some manufacturers may simply decide not to do business in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` Most companies could n't have a two-product distribution system _ one for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and another for the rest of the nation,'' he said. Deodorant makers had earlier appealed to the board because they felt the restrictions would cost millions of dollars and have little effect on pollution. `` We believe the emission reduction is so small that it does n't warrant this kind of treatment,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Specialty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> The board has authority over the quality of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s air, and its order on aerosols does not need the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s approval. The action was taken in conjunction with the first phase of a 20-year, three-part plan approved in August to help smoggy <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> meet federal clean-air requirements. The first phase also will include a ban on barbecue lighter fluid and restrictions on smokestack emissions. Spray underarm deodorants and antiperspirants release about five tons of pollutants into the air statewide every day, the board said.

<TEXT>
 When the orange sunset glows on the white wood frame houses along Ninth Street, most of the neighbors of `` Crack Alley'' know it's time to get off the streets. But federal drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> did n't see the area of north-central <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> at its worst during his visit today. The tired-looking but homey neighborhood seems quiet during daylight hours. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> met with law officers and substance abuse experts at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, where Police Chief <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> boasted, `` You spend about $ 1 million in this community and we'll show you what hometown <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> can do to clean up its own act.'' The nation's drug policy chief gave assurances that the government is devoting more money to fighting drugs, but he said, `` I did n't bring my checkbook with me. I'm not the secretary of treasury. I'm in charge of drug policy.'' During the day here, the old two-chair barber shop operates, and dilapidated, paint-starved Turner Drug with its 1950s soda fountain decor is open for business. A few residents visit with each other outdoors; kids gather on the playground at <ORGANIZATION> Dunbar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. It's a different world after dark. As soon as night falls, the neighborhood begins its deadly transformation. Children are whisked into homes by their parents, laid-back corner dwellers abandon the sidewalks and the shadows that congregate near `` No Loitering'' signs do n't promise comradery. During the past year, several blocks on either side of Ninth Street have become a free-fire zone for dealers and buyers of crack cocaine. During the past three months, four people have died from gunfire there; three people were wounded last week. Police investigating assaults and homicides are sometimes frustrated because the number of fresh and old shell casings on the ground make it difficult to sort out usable evidence. `` There is shooting every night,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 34, a lifelong Wichitan who still hangs around the area to visit friends. `` They do n't always hit somebody. Sometimes they just shoot up in the air to scare people.'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said he was nearby when 20-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> was struck by a stray bullet Oct. 28 while visiting with friends. <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, who was eight months pregnant, died. Her baby was delivered by Caesarean section but died four hours later. The 18-year-old suspect is charged in another `` Crack Alley'' shooting two days earlier at the same intersection. The teen-age victim told police he was walking away from an argument between a drug dealer and some women when the dealer shot him in the arm and leg. `` It used to be a good fun place where you could go hang with your partners. Not any more,'' said a woman who was with <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> on Tuesday night. `` I come down here to get my honey, but I stay away from what's going on.'' There was fear in her voice when a white reporter who had offered the black couple a ride started to drive toward one of the local hangouts, a liquor store with scantily stocked shelves and wire and wrought-iron protected windows. `` If you're going this way I'm going to duck down because they see me driving around with a white man I might get shot as a snitch next time I'm out on the street,'' she said. Police have increased patrols in the area for months, but the violence continues. Last weekend a 60-year-old man, who was awaiting trial on drug charges, was stabbed to death. Most of the cocaine is brought in by Dominicans who control much of the crack trade in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, police say. <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> has seen drugs before, but never such drug-related violence. An 80-year-old woman who has lived in the neighborhood since the 1930s said she hears gunfire sometimes at night after she turns off her television. `` I just try not to pay attention to it, because the more I think about it the worse I feel,'' she said, asking not to be identified for fear of reprisal. `` I do n't feel too afraid unless somebody comes knocking on my door or something. But I do n't answer my door.''

 West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> arrived today for a six-day visit that will take him to <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> and the ethnic German region of <LOCATION> Krzyzowa </LOCATION>. It marked the first visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> by a West German leader since 1977 and <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s first meeting with new Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> brought a $ 1 billion aid package that the first non-Communist government in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc hopes will help secure democratic reforms. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, the former Solidarity editor elected two months ago, and several other top Polish government officials greeted <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Okecie </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> exchanged words with school children in the welcoming party before leaving for talks with <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed today to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to debate President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed capital-gains tax reduction, but there appeared little chance it would clear <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement was announced by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. He said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would pass in a new bill the capital-gains cut that it approved on Sept. 28 as part of a deficit-reduction plan. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans would offer their own capital-gains cut as a substitute for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan, and the debate would center on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> proposal. However, neither proposal is likely to become law this year because most Senate Democrats are opposed. It would take 60 votes to cut off a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> filibuster against a capital-gains cut, and even <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> acknowledged today that chances of getting that many votes are `` iffy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Republicans failed in earlier attempts to attach a capital-gains cut to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> deficit-reduction bill and to a measure raising the government's borrowing authority. Some lawmakers feared that if they engaged in a lengthy debate, those bills could be jeopardized. In next week's debate, capital gains will not be tied to any other issue, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> noted. `` That excuse will be gone,'' he said. `` Either they are for or against capital gains. No more excuses.'' Present law taxes capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments, at the same rates as wages and other incomes. During his campaign last year, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a lower tax on capital gains as a way to spur investment and economic growth. Democratic leaders oppose a capital-gains tax cut on grounds 80 percent of the benefits would go to those with incomes above $ 200,000 a year. They also say that restoring a preferential tax rate for capital gains would begin the unraveling of the landmark 1986 tax overhaul. With the backing of 64 Democrats, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was able to win a reduction in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> but the effort stalled in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The House-passed proposal would exempt 30 percent of capital gains from taxation until 1992. Starting in 1992, the system would be `` indexed'' so that the portion of gains caused by inflation would not be taxed. The plan proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans would allow an exemption based on how long an asset was held. If property was owned for more than a year, 5 percent of the profit would be tax-exempt. The exempt portion would increase by 5 percentage points each year to a maximum of seven years; thus, 35 percent of profit from the sale of an asset owned more than seven years would escape taxation. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plan also includes an expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts. Unlike present IRAs, which provide tax deductions for some workers at the time a deposit is made, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> IRAs would offer no tax benefit until the money is withdrawn for retirement, or education or medical expenses.

<TEXT>
 Victorious black Democrats toured the Capitol today and <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said his triumph in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> governor's race proved `` Americans have come of age.'' Republicans were debating whether their 1989 election debacle was an ominous sign about their prospects for the much heavier ballot slate in 1990. During a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> joked about the narrowness of his margin _ a majority his Republican opponent still questions. Turning to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the mayor-elect of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> congratulated him and other Democrats, `` some of whom had landslide victories like I did.'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was asked if racism was the reason he ran behind other Democratic candidates for statewide office and he replied, `` It says I had a very negative campaign being waged against me and my ticketmates did n't.'' `` Americans have come of age,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said. `` What was preached and practiced for some time has come full cycle.'' `` I do n't think <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> is saying that racism is not a factor'' in elections, said <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. `` But I do believe that tremendous progress has been achieved. But things are not perfect in our land, to be sure. It's -LRB- racism -RRB- on the wane. It's not as great as it was.'' Democrats were jubilant as they tallied gains that included the governor's mansion in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> as well as the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and the election of blacks as governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Analysts of political trends among blacks hailed not only the results in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but also in such cities as <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, as `` a new direction.'' <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, appearing with <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, said he believes the election demonstrated that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s stance on abortion is `` an untenable position.'' He said he believes President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has `` painted himself into a corner'' by taking a strong anti-abortion position. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Tuesday's election results show the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` is not only alive and well, but strong and getting stronger.'' Standing between <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the chairman praised the two blacks as men who projected themselves as `` mainstream Democrats'' whose appeal transcended race. `` We've built tremendous momentum,'' he said. `` We think it's an important building block'' as the party looks to the 1990 congressional elections and the 1992 race for the White House. In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said the outcome of the governor's race was `` still in doubt.'' He said that if the official vote tally, due in four more days, shows <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s victory margin in the governor's race is as narrow as expected, he will ask for a recount. The unofficial tally showed <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> by about 5,500 votes out of a total of 1.78 million cast. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law authorizes recounts if the difference is less than one half of 1 percent. `` There's no way for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to find any silver lining at all in what happened yesterday,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` No time in my lifetime do I ever remember waking up the morning after an election where one party had won everything, all over the country.'' `` The Democrats are on a roll,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have recruited better candidates. Our candidates have better mainstream messages. And the voters are responding.'' Many Republicans followed the lead of party chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> in brushing off <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> losses with the comment that `` all politics is local.'' `` It's hard to see a message,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, chairman of the House Republican Policy committee. But House Republican whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> saw the results as a clear warning. `` Any Republican who looks honestly at yesterday's results has to be very sobered up and has to be willing to rethink exactly what we're going to do in 1990 if we're going to have a successful year,'' said <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> after a White House post-mortem on the elections. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s strongest supporters of abortion rights, emerged from the meeting and said that if abortion is an issue in 1990 `` we will just get the bejabbers kicked out of us. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> called abortion `` a very small part of the equation.'' `` We as a party, we're not big enough, we do n't run aggressive enough campaigns, we do n't stay in the game full-time,'' said the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> congressman. Defections on the abortion issue already are beginning. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, Republican gubernatorial candidate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and a number of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state legislators joined Democrats in signing a petition seeking a state constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to abortion. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said the results demonstrated that `` if <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and members of his party remain beholden to the anti-choice minority, they will pay a tremendous price at the polls.'' `` The lesson that will be learned ... is that pro-life candidates can not waffle and pro-life candidates must run as aggressively on this issue as pro-abortion candidates,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Steen </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned for the losers in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. His only comment on Wednesday was `` wait'till next year.'' <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>, a White House spokesman who normally specializes in foreign affairs, handled political questions in the absence of press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and told reporters, `` Suffice it to say, this election's over with. We're pleased with the victory that our candidates have achieved in certain elections and we're looking forward to the 1990 elections We're looking forward optimistically to 1990.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it will rebuild a smaller version of the polyethylene plant that was destroyed last month by a series of explosions.

 The first comprehensive report on Hurricane Hugo's assault on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> puts the damage at $ 4 billion and estimates more than 40,000 people will need counseling.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave a warm welcome to <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> today and predicted that their countries will be able to reach a new agreement governing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. With Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> standing at his side during a rain-spattered arrival ceremony on the White House south lawn, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We are confident we'll mold a new and mutually beneficial long-term security partnership in the future.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has remained silent on the issue, refusing to say whether she believes a continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is desireable. She made no reference to the base issue in her arrival statement, indicating that the focus of her talks would be on economic issues. Asked by reporters about the base issue later while posing for photographers with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> noted only that preliminary talks begin next month. In her formal remarks, she said: `` We will raise particularly the means by which the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can cooperate in more ways to our mutual economic benefit. We shall explore the means to increase trade between two countries with long historic ties and deep cultural affinities.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke warmly of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s success in helping restore democracy to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> after long years of authoritarian rule during the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> era. He called the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> `` a beacon of democracy worthy of imitation throughout the world.'' After her meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> planned to attend a luncheon hosted by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and meet with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders. She is the guest of honor at a White House state dinner tonight. The two main themes during her visit, which ends Saturday night, will be trade and investment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> remains strong, but she is not expected to match the tumultuous reception she had in 1986 when she visited seven months after leading the successful fight to depose President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. She so charmed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that lawmakers rammed through a $ 200 million aid package for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in record time. Since then, the mutual confidence of the two countries has been shaken somewhat by acrimonious negotiations last year over the terms for the continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Also contributing to the sense of unease is Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s refusal to rule out the possibility that she might ask <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> soldiers to leave once the existing agreement on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases expires in 1991 Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s ambivalence reflects the existence of an influential minority in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> which believes the continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence at the bases infringes on Filipino sovereignty. Talks on a new base agreement open next month and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe that, after considerable wrangling, they will conclude with agreement that the bases remain. `` We think that there's a logic that both parties will see at the end. That is to say that these facilities do, in fact, serve the interests of both countries in very important ways,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who briefed reporters Tuesday on condition that he not be identified. `` And I think that will be the compelling fact that will assert itself. And I think we will have an agreement.'' The two principal installations are <ORGANIZATION> Subic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> <PERSON> Base </PERSON>. They are considered among the most important <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities abroad. Congressional attitudes towards the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are somewhat more tightfisted than before because some lawmakers believe economic reform and increased trade would improve living standards there more than additional economic aid. Still, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> commands a considerable measure of good will both in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in other Western democracies. One example is the commitment among donor countries to provide the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> with $ 14 billion in aid over five years. During her stay, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is expected to stress her accomplishments since 1986, including the consolidation of democracy, the failure of five coup attempts, a restoration of economic growth and a leveling off of the threat of the Marxist insurgency.

<HEAD>Company Designs 500-Story Building, But No Plans to Build It</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A construction company said Thursday it has designed a 500-story skyscraper for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, although there are no immediate plans to build it. The designers would need 25 years and $ 326.2 billion to build the 6,669-foot-tall `` Aeropolis 2001,'' said <PERSON> Yasuyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Ohbayashi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. This includes the money necessary to reclaim a 56-square-mile island in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, he added. The project was made possible by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s advanced techniques to protect buildings in earthquakes, he said. The tallest building in earthquake-prone <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the 60-story Sunshine City Building in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The 110-story Sears Tower in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is the world's tallest building. <PERSON> Yukihisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokunaga </PERSON>, a city planning official of the Construction Ministry, said the 500-story building is one of a number of private plans by major construction firms to meet <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s growing need for office and apartment space. `` I understand that none of the plans, including what they call ` Waterfronts,' ` Geofronts,' ` Undergroundpolis' and ` <LOCATION> Aeropolis </LOCATION>,' has been submitted for any government approval,'' <PERSON> Tokunaga </PERSON> said. The Ohbayashi building would be able to accommodate 300,000 people. Aside from office space and residential units, it also would have space for hotels, hospitals, parks and convention centers. The design envisions elevators that would reach the top floor in 15 minutes. The building is shaped like a triangle, becoming smaller at the top to help it absorb shock waves. It would have a number of tunnels to let typhoon winds pass through rather than hitting the building with full force. The Japanese archipelago, in the world's most active seismic zone, is hit each year by some 1,000 tremors strong enough to be felt. Three times this century, in 1923, 1946 and 1948, quake deaths have climbed into the thousands. The Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 leveled vast areas of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION>, killing 140,000 people. About 25 typhoons develop in the region annually. In the early 1960s, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> developed a technique of building flexible structures to replace the rigid construction techniques favored for decades. Under the old concept, engineers built structures of up to 11 stories, using ferroconcrete solid pillars and walls to absorb shock and sustain the building's weight. The new concept called for making walls of slabs of reinforced concrete with several slits on the surface. Using the new method, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s 36-story, 482-foot-tall <LOCATION> Kasumigaseki </LOCATION> Building was completed in 1968. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> has about 200 buildings of 12 stories or more, all erected since 1963.

<TEXT>
 The end of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s official career leaves <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> without a paramount leader for the first time since he rose from disgrace after <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s Cultural Revolution to undisputed power a decade ago. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 85, announced at a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting Thursday he is leaving his last party post, chairman of the powerful party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He also will resign soon as head of the state military commission, a job with overlapping functions. His departure was accompanied by a carefully crafted compromise that bolsters, at least for now, the political stature of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s appointed successor, new party chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, 63, was named to succeed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> on the military commission, a vital post in a nation where the army wields considerable political clout. His rival for the job, hard-line President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, becomes first vice chairman. In another concession to <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, a mastermind of the June army crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, his younger brother <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Baibing </PERSON>, an army political commissar, was appointed secretary-general of the military commission. Although <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> described <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> party boss with a weak power base in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, as the `` nucleus'' of the new leadership generation, many believe the party leader's political fortunes are inextricably tied to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s physical health. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is certain to remain the ultimate authority as long as he remains healthy, and will protect <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, an economic moderate and political conservative. A diplomat in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said, however, that if <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> dies, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> `` has no chance.'' He said <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s new post on the military commission, together with the promotion of <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s brother, `` looks like a compromise'' but `` nothing's been really resolved. There is no clear sign one way or the other.'' In a power struggle likely to follow <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s death, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> could be trapped between the conservatives, led by <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, and the reform camp, now in retreat but capable of a comeback. One indication the reformers are not yet out was the failure of the party meeting to condemn <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, the reform-minded party leader who was purged in June after being accused of supporting the pro-democracy demonstrations. There had been speculation the party would recommend criminal charges against <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who has been under house arrest since the crackdown. The lack of further criticism indicates he still has the respect of many party leaders, including <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. The paramount leader has nurtured such reformers as <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who carried out his bold ideas on economic reform, but <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> also has managed to keep the old ideologues at bay by adopting a conservative line on political dissent. In the past two years, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has permitted the dismissal of two proteges, the late party chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, to keep his reforms intact. In perhaps his last balancing act, the man <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has put on the tightrope this time is <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, a relatively obscure politician with the formidable task of avoiding political disarray while leading a nation of 1 billion people toward economic prosperity.

<HEAD>Excerpts of Walesa Interview</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Walesa, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Excerpts from interview with <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, as translated from Polish by The Associated Press:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ On the situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>: Now we strive for economic pluralism. That is the most difficult one. We are living in the jungle of the East. The jungle of bureaucracy. Terrible regulations. Abnormal attitudes. Lack of competence. So it is the jungle of the East. We need Columbuses from the <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and others to come to discover <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, to clear the trail. As <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON> smoothed the way into <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, those Columbuses should blaze the trail to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. ... Just look through this window. <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> has not been repainted in 45 years. Two-thirds of this city are slums, as in all of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Two-thirds should be demolished and rebuilt. All the cars should be replaced. They should n't be used. So, in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>? Where is there business opportunity, there or here? But first clear the trail, clear it like <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. And then there will an influx of millionaires. Because there is business to be done here.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ On his trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>: Any trip to the States shorter than one month is no good. It should be only one day or at least one month. And if I am going for five days, it is neither this nor that. There will be many people who I will insult, many will be discouraged. And I will disappoint many people. Because they deserve a talk, I should meet them. How can I choose who and whom? It is impossible. This program -LRB- for the visit -RRB- is bad, but it is impossible to make up a good one. We can not make a good program. So that is why I will disappoint many. And that is why it is not a good trip and a trip which is dangerous for me. I can not satisfy Americans in such a short time. I can not thank Americans enough, because it is physically impossible. That is why it is so hard.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ On how he makes decisions: I just calculate. I set up my mind and it works like a computer. It calculates everything. And it just chooses. So far it is not too bad. But I do n't know. I am getting older. But I am trying to save myself. I am doing calisthenics now because I am starting to feel exhausted. Maybe I weigh too much. Just to stretch it out, I started wearing blue jeans, pretending I am 18 years old. I do sports to extend my life. I do n't know if it is going to work.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ On his life: I do n't like what I am doing. I was born as a free man. And now what's offered me is slavery. Just look, now BOR -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is sitting on my tail. I do n't want it. I did not want it. But I can not throw them out, that would be breaking the law. Someone decided that they should be there -LRB- guarding me. -RRB- And all of this makes me a slave. I am fighting for freedom. I have been fighting for Saturdays off. And I do n't even have Sundays off. I am supposed to be free, and as it turns out I felt better when I was a prisoner than I do now that I am free. Then I could lay down and rest. And now it's like being under arrest even at home. I can not even walk outside. Somebody is immediately on me. They see me everywhere. And so time is running out. I want to live a little, and I do n't know if it is possible anymore.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ On whether he will be president of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>: No, no, in all likelihood I will not be. But, then, that is only what I am saying today. Unless it is very easy, everything settled in advance, and I will in fact be there only symbolically, and to be free, and to get the health insurance, so I can go to the doctor. But if it is going to be as hard plowing as it is now, then I do n't want to be president. I want to be president only in order to rest. But if there is any work, then I do n't want it.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ On his influence on the government: No, I do n't have it and I do n't want to have it. I have been building and I am building political pluralism. And if there is an elected government, it should do its own work. The last time, I allowed myself to be used, manipulated into posing for pictures -LRB- with all the Solidarity candidates -RRB- for the elections. That was the last time. I will not allow that again. It -LRB- politics -RRB- should be based on a program. If I have been criticizing this government, and I have done it a few times, it is for not speeding up completion of political pluralism. That makes it difficult to create new and better programs. I do n't criticize them for other things because they are new, they are learning. But it must complete political reforms, and the sooner the better.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ On Solidarity's influence: Today, we are building things and pluralism, and there is no one else to build them. And tomorrow, we will make demands, just like other unions, and we will be not loved, just like other unions are n't. And maybe we should not be called Solidarity anymore. We needed Solidarity to fight for reforms, to unite us, and to share the burden. But later on in our work, we should take down this banner, fold it, preserve it, and put it in a trunk so that our children, when things get bad again, can take it out and fight against us. That is what I think. But will democracy allow me to do it? Because what we are building is against us. Because I should be striving so that everything is -LRB- controlled by -RRB- Solidarity _ the party, the government, the economy _ everything Solidarity, led by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. But that is not what it's all about. I can not replace one monopoly with another one. So whatever I build, it will be against me. Because pluralism and democracry are guided by their own rules. It takes some ideas away. And it is pushing me and us more and more to the side. It is tough, but that is how it has to be.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ On whether the Communist system is finished: A long time ago. But it all depends on what we understand by `` communism.'' If you understand the monopoly of one party, monopoly over everything, then that has been over for a long time. It can not be maintained. But certain slogans in different conditions can still do a lot of things, and they may be very popular. But there can be no limitation of freedom and pluralism anymore. If communism corrects these two things and a few other minor things, then it will not be entirely a stupid ideology someday, when people forget about all its sins.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ On criticism of his accepting a government-issued <ORGANIZATION> Lancia </ORGANIZATION> car and driver: Yes, but it is not important to me. I am supposed to fight with my arguments and my program and I can bring this program faster in a <ORGANIZATION> Lancia </ORGANIZATION>. And I will make it much faster than I would on a bicycle. ... I do n't really want it, but I have been using it because I would be stupid not to. My stomach aches when I am in a Syrenka -LRB- an old model car -RRB- because of the vibrations. The vibrations do n't suit me.

 Rapid and radical change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has divided <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and could lead to a looser alliance in the next decade, the former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` The picture today is muddier than I've seen it in my 25 years of experience with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' Retired Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said at a congressional <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing on future national security needs. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said the Western alliance is sharply split between cautious response and the desire of some to undertake `` headlong reductions'' in military might. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to spread defense costs more equitably among alliance members will likely have little effect, he said. `` The countries of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are going to spend less on defense no matter what we do,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> told the panel. `` Ultimately, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will probably remold itself into a looser arrangement, probably with reduced <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. participation.'' Such an outcome also would reduce American influence over <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> affairs, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. The rapid restructuring occurring in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the political and economic reforms it has touched off in countries such as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> `` are stunning,'' said <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, who retired last month as the nation's top military officer. `` I never thought it would happen in my lifetime.'' It's too early to say what impact the changes will have on U.S.-Soviet relations, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said, calling the situation `` a very uncertain strategic transition. ... The future ai n't what it used to be.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planners should be `` very cautious'' about making any sudden cut in military spending, he said. `` We should use the first rule of wing walking,'' said <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, referring to the barnstorming acrobats of decades past: `` Never let go of something until you've got ahold of something else.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said it was too soon to pronounce the Cold War over, but said it could happen if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reach arms control agreements on strategic nuclear weapons and conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But even if those trends play out successfully, he said, the Soviets will still have a 4 million member military force. `` We have to fashion some kind of security relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. As such a relationship is forged, regional instabilities around the world will assume a greater role in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> calculations of security needs, he said, mentioning the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> fired its thrusters today to start the first of about 30 course corrections the craft will make during its six-year, 2.4-billion-mile journey to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. `` So far everything is going just fine,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> mission director at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. During the three-day maneuver, which started at 8:31 a.m. PST, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will fire its thrusters in pulses of no more than two minutes each. The maneuver is meant to aim <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> for its flight past <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> in February.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> today dismissed speculation he is quitting the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` If I was going to switch parties, I would hold a press conference and I would tell the people at home I was switching parties and why,'' the lawmaker said. `` I would n't make a switch unless I had a compelling reason.'' The State newspaper in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> today quoted unidentified sources as saying the 62-year-old, two-term congressman feels out of step with the Republicans and is considering becoming a Democrat but wants assurances he can keep his committee assignments. In a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office today, <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> said he is frustrated because he has been unable to obtain a seat on the <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He called the appointment `` extremely important to the health and wealth'' of his district. <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> said if he is rebuffed in his effort to get on the committee, `` certainly I would consider my options.'' He declined to say what those options might be, but when asked if they would include defecting to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, he said: `` I would n't go that far.'' In an interview earlier this week, <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON>, whose coastal district includes Hilton Head, <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and was battered by Hurricane Hugo in September, expressed disenchantment with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, The State reported. He said he had been criticized by conservatives in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> for his recent support of funding for abortion in cases of incest or rape and for backing some spending measures. `` I'm just not a right-winger. I'm a moderate, and it just drives some of the Republicans back home up the wall,'' <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` I could just as easily be a Democrat as a Republican.'' But <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> said today those comments were `` a lot of old stuff I've been saying for a long time.'' The congressman said that he draws on support from Democrats as well as Republicans at election time. His district had been historically Democratic before it went for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980. If <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> switched parties, it would be a coup for the Democrats, in part because it would happen in <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s backyard. A switch by <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> also would come on the heels of the Democrats' sweep of Tuesday's major elections in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Americans Hold Unusual Abortion Protest in Soviet Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two dozen Americans held posters, lighted candles and heard speeches outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in a protest of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's abortion policy that drew puzzled looks and laughter from Soviet passersby. `` It's incomprehensible! It's absurd!'' one elderly woman said after stopping to read a poster that said in Russian, `` Return my Body!'' The Americans, who are studying <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> or working in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, called the demonstration in advance of more than 1,000 rallies and other events by abortion rights activists in 150 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities scheduled Sunday. The protesters assembled on the sidewalk outside the embassy's main entrance, an area crammed with Armenians and Jews who want to emigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> The timing of the protest, during the evening rush hour, also drew curious passersby. One woman stopped to ask what the protest was about and when told it concerned restrictions on abortions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, she said with a laugh and smile, `` Come to us. We'll do it.'' Abortion is the primary form of birth control in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and each woman has an average of nine abortions. One speaker said that like Americans, Soviet women have been deprived of the choice to have an abortion. Here, the woman said, Soviets must have abortions because they have no contraceptives. Soviet police guarding the embassy entrance watched without trying to stop the protest. <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Essig </PERSON>, 24, a protester who studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Pushkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Russian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Language </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the rally was held outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> so government representatives inside could see the opposition to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's abortion policies. With demonstrations common in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on issues ranging from democracy to emigration, one woman remarked after stopping by the abortion protest, `` It's become so interesting here! You never get bored.''

<HEAD>Air Raid Shelter, Ships Latest Ideas to House Refugees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Officials Thursday hunted for every available space, including ships and an air raid shelter, to house the deluge of East German refugees heading into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The chaos is growing larger and larger,'' said <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON>, the social services minister of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalia </LOCATION> state. The West German government issued a caution to any more East Germans planning to join the flow of more than 200,000 who have headed West this year. `` Every refugee must figure that he will have to live in inadequate housing for a fairly long time, and will probably be living much worse than if he had stayed home,'' said Interior Minister <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON>, in a speech to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said the federal government has no intention of turning back any East Germans. Amusement parks and vacation apartments are next on the list in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for possible emergency shelters, which already have been set up in military barracks, camping places and gymnasiums. Refugees also are being housed in hotels temporarily. The <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> oil company said it was making available the administration building of a closed plant in the town of <LOCATION> Monheim </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to provide temporary shelter for 100 refugees. Most of the East Germans stay in the shelters or hotels until they can move in with relatives or find an apartment in an increasingly tight and costly rental market. There have been increasing predictions of difficulties in absorbing the newcomers. But opposition leader <PERSON> Hans-Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said it would be erroneous for `` orthodox'' Communists in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to think they could spark a right-wing backlash in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by encouraging the exodus. Compounding the housing difficulties are the 300,000 ethnic Germans from other parts of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the 90,000 asyslum seekers who have reached <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> so far this year. The influx also has created problems in finding jobs, while strapping social services across the country. <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhine-Westphalia </ORGANIZATION> social services minister, said the organizational difficulties of handling the East German refugees `` can hardly be overcome.'' The social services minister said in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> the state government is hoping to rent eight ships to house 1,000 East German refugees each, while amusement parks and vacation apartments were also being targeted. In the port of <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION>, social services director <PERSON> Hans-Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoppensack </PERSON> said city officials would set up a temporary shelter in an underground air raid shelter. <PERSON> Hoppensack </PERSON> said the East German refugees would move in within the next few days, but declined to outline specifics. Hanover Mayor <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmalstieg </PERSON>, who also serves as the president of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s league of cities, warned that local authorities nationwide would soon be unable to accept either East German refugees or ethnic Germans. `` Hanover may soon be forced to take this step,'' <PERSON> Schmalstieg </PERSON> told reporters on Thursday. But in the southern city of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, officials had another idea. Police say they would like to hear from any refugees who were members of the Volkspolizei, the East German police force. <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> police say they would be happy to consider signing up the former Vopos, as they are called, to switch uniforms and start patroling the streets of the Bavarian capital.

 Two Soviet men who came to town to see the unveiling of a Russian mural have defected. `` We have received two asylum applications from Soviet citizens.

He declined to identify the men but said they defected late last week. They will be allowed to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pending a review of their applications, which could take weeks, <PERSON> Swan </PERSON> said. The baked clay mural, brought here as part of an art exchange program, was unveiled last week at the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>. The two men who defected were not part of the delegation of artists and musicians who arrived here by ship with the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> mural, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohlschmidt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> participant in the US-Soviet exchange. The men flew here for the unveiling at the invitation of two women, <PERSON> Ohlschmidt </PERSON> said. The men had played host to the women when a delegation from <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> presented a mural to the residents of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> in July, and the women were returning the favor, officials said. `` We had no idea this was going to happen. It took us by complete surprise,'' <PERSON> Ohlschmidt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON>, organizer of the art exchange, was quick to distance the men from the project. `` They are two grown men who made a choice,'' <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> said. `` They were not part of the project.

 At least six people who attended a high school reunion at a motel in September have contracted Legionnaires' disease and two died, health officials said today The six cases were among 17 people who came down with pneumonia-like symptoms after the gathering at the Best Western Cow Palace Inn in <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON> said the department is awaiting lab results but that all 17 cases are believed to involve Legionnaires' disease. Three of those stricken have died, two of them with confirmed cases of Legionnaires'. The four others with confirmed Legionnaires' cases recovered. Two other persons got the disease after staying at the motel prior to the reunion Sept. 22-24. However, health department officials today said they did not include those cases in the 17 because they can not be directly linked to the motel. Legionnaires' is believed to be caused by bacteria that are found in soil and grow in water, favoring such places as air conditioning ducts, storage tanks and rivers. The disease takes its name from an outbreak at a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> American Legion convention held at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> hotal in 1976. Thirty-four people died in that outbreak. Epidemiologists took air and water samples from guest rooms and common areas of the Cow Palace last weekend. Results are expected next week, said <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON>. Health Department officials are giving a questionnaire and blood test to motel employees.

<HEAD>Vatican, Soviet Cooperate on Exhibit of Russian Icons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> is holding the first exhibit of Russian religious icons outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in what a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> official Thursday described as a sign of the rapprochement between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the Holy See. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> will inaugurate the exhibit Friday, three weeks before his scheduled meeting with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the first between supreme leaders of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and Kremlin. The exhibit of 107 medieval icons, seven ancient Russian embroideries and three sculptures was presented to reporters Thursday by officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museums </ORGANIZATION> and J.S. <PERSON> Melentev </PERSON>, minister of culture for the Russian republic. `` We consider this exhibit a concrete step on the road to greater mutual understanding'' with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Melentev </PERSON> said. To underline the improved ties, he read the text of a Nov. 4 Soviet Politburo communique, which he said would have been `` unthinkable one or two years ago,'' approving the Oct. 20 meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and a top <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> foreign ministry official, Archbishop <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sodano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is scheduled to meet with the pope at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> during his Nov. 29-Dec. 1 visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has often expressed the wish to visit his flock in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and church officials say the talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could clear the way for such a trip. <PERSON> Melentev </PERSON>, who will present the exhibit to the pope Friday, said he hopes a papal visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can take place `` in the not too distant future.'' The minister's speech was filled with comments indicative of the more open attitude toward religion in the officially atheist <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He spoke of the country's spiritual roots, the improvement in East-West relations, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s vision of a `` common European home.'' `` We are on the threshold of a new era, the third millennium since the birth of Christ. ... In the name of this fragile common home, people are ready to abandon old stereotypes and ways of thinking,'' <PERSON> Melentev </PERSON> said. He quoted a phrase from author <PERSON> Rudyard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kipling </PERSON> _ `` Oh, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> is </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and West is West and never the twain shall meet'' _ and said: `` Kipling probably made a mistake. Because now it is necessary for East and West to meet and find a common path. Step by step, not only states and governments, but all people are moving in this direction. We should get used to this.'' Melentev even quoted from the Bible: `` A time to scatter stones, and a time to gather.''

 Although he gave up most official titles in recent years, paramount leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> retained ultimate power and fashioned a decade of economic reform. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 85, resigned Thursday from his last formal <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> post, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> _ an action delayed, according to reports, by the pro-democracy movement crushed in June. Reports indicated <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> had hoped to step down after the visit in May of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The end of a 30-year estrangement between the Communist giants would have been the crowning achievement of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s career. The student-led demonstrations for democracy overshadowed the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visit, however, and led to the bloody military crackdown. At least among educated Chinese, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is likely to be remembered more as the hard-liner who ordered the army to suppress the democracy movement than as the reformer who created economic modernization. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was born Aug. 22, 1904, as <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zegao </PERSON>, son of a wealthy landowner in southwest <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province, and changed his name when he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> more than six decades ago. He was purged and rehabilitated three times. After one purge, he was jailed, called a `` capitalist roader'' and paraded through <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> wearing a dunce cap. In 1978, at age 74, he won the power struggle that followed the death two years earlier of Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>. Under <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> established normal relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, worked out agreements to regain <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION>, and achieved an unprecedented relaxation of tensions with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, seat of the rival Nationalist government. He reduced the bloated <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> by 1 million men, cut military spending and presided over the first codification of civil and criminal law. The economy grew enormously under <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s stewardship. Central controls were eased and foreign capital flooded in, but rapid growth created inflation and bribery became commonplace. Political corruption spread and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was linked to it through his son, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Pufang </PERSON>, who was associated with a company accused of tax evasion and other questionable practices. Outrage over corruption by bureaucrats and party functionaries culminated in the student-led protests that began in April. Workers, intellectuals and pensioners joined in, often chanting, `` Xiaoping, step down!''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> opened a $ 2.7 million visitors' center Thursday that boasts high-tech computer displays in the same historic Castle building where <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> observed hot-air balloon maneuvers during the Civil War. Electronic wall maps, touch screen video displays in seven languages, two movie theaters and scale models of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s downtown tourist attractions _ including one with <ORGANIZATION> Braille </ORGANIZATION> captions _ will greet the 3 million visitors who are expected to use the new <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> next year One stop at the Victorian-style Castle's great hall, said Assistant Smithsonian Secretary <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinzler </PERSON>, `` will help visitors make the best use of their time at the museums and save them the frustration of an endless trek from building to building.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> has expanded greatly since 1855, when the Castle was built to house its early scientific collections. Today the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> includes 14 museums and galleries, plus the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, which attracted 28 million visits last year. At the newly renovated ground floor of the Castle, cherrywood kiosks contain 13 video screens giving tourists detailed information and travel directions to Smithsonian attractions and scores of other <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> landmarks. Volunteers are available to answer such frequent questions as `` Where is the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> brothers' plane?'' -LRB- in the National Air and Space Museum -RRB- or `` How much is the Hope diamond worth?'' -LRB- it's priceless -RRB- New ramp entrances at the east and west wings of the building are designed to accommodate wheelchairs and baby strollers. Restrooms include diaper-changing facilities. In addition, the former Children's Room at the south entrance, closed nearly a half-century ago to make room for offices, was restored and reopened to the public Thursday as a lounge. Decorated with wall stencils, peacock feathers and ceiling paintings, the vaulted room resembles its appearance in 1901, when it was installed with stuffed birds and aquariums of special interest to children. The two-year renovation of the ground floor of the red sandstone Castle, whose towers, gables and battlements are a familiar sight on the National Mall, was privately financed by donations from individuals and several foundations. The Castle is a National Historic Landmark whose upper floors house the offices of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McC </PERSON>. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Woodrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholars </ORGANIZATION>. It also contains the crypt of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smithson </PERSON>, the eccentric English scientist who bequeathed his estate of $ 515,169 in gold sovereigns to establish the institution in his name. The Castle originally provided living quarters for the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s first secretary, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, and his family, and once served as home for bachelor curators, visiting scientists and a 30-foot dinosaur skeleton. Its visitors have included <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, who observed <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> reconnaissance balloons from the Castle's main tower

<TEXT>
 The Democratic-controlled House today approved a $ 305 billion defense bill that slashes $ 1.1 billion from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spending request for the Strategic Defense Initiative in fiscal 1990. By a vote of 236-172, lawmakers approved legislation that provides much of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request for land-based nuclear missiles and restores some funds for two conventional-arms programs the president sought to kill. The bill provides $ 3.8 billion for SDI, also known as Star Wars, in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 _ about $ 279 million less than the amount spent in fiscal 1989. The spending level represents the first reduction in the SDI program in its six-year history. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said this budget represents the `` last deficit-driven defense budget What we're likely to face next year is the first in a series of -LRB- Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- Gorbachev-driven defense budgets.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., said reductions in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense budget in response to efforts toward democracy in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should occur this year `` The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact is crumbling before our eyes and we're building weapons of destruction,'' said <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> panel The legislation, which still must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, includes approximately $ 1.1 billion for the rail-based MX multiple-warhead missile and the truck-based Midgetman single-warhead missile, about $ 150 million less than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had requested for the two nuclear weapons. The bill also includes House language imposing a 50-missile cap on the MX. The bill provides $ 4.3 billion for the B-2 stealth bomber program _ $ 430 million less than the adminstration requested. It provides money for the purchase of two stealth bombers in fiscal 1990 and components for five of the bat-winged aircraft in fiscal 1991. The legislation restores some money for the two conventional-arms programs <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to cancel _ the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Osprey </ORGANIZATION> tilt-rotor aircraft and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F-14D Tomcat. The Osprey, an aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but can fly like a plane, will receive about $ 255 million in research and development money but no funds for procurement. The future of the program would be tied to commercial use of the plane. The legislation also includes a provision calling for the purchase of 18 F-14D fighters in fiscal 1990. However, the bill requires the manufacturer of the F-14D, <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, to sign a contract to end future production of the plane.

<TEXT>
 A coalition of national health groups launched a campaign Thursday to raise awareness of glaucoma, especially among blacks for whom the disease is the leading cause of blindness. Glaucoma is the second-leading cause of blindness among Americans overall after diabetic retinopathy, but blacks are four to six times as likely to get the disease as whites, medical experts said at a news conference. `` Awareness is essential because glaucoma has few, if any, early symptoms and if it is detected early blindness can be prevented,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, an associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 2 million Americans have glaucoma; at least 1 million have lost some sight and 80,000 are blind because of it. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> to Prevent Blindness announced a new effort to reduce blindness from glaucoma by focusing screening and public education on high-risk groups. The program will try to get physicians to identify those at risk and refer them for complete eye exams. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> designated Nov. 12-18 as National Glaucoma Awareness Week. Blacks, the elderly, diabetics, people who are nearsighted and those with a family history of glaucoma are at high risk for developing the disease, caused by a buildup of fluid pressure inside the eye. The fluid buildup eventually damages nerve cells in the eye. A recent Gallup survey found that a majority of adults incorrectly believe that a feeling of pressure in the eyes is a sign of glaucoma and that eye damage from the disease can be corrected. Medical experts say that when detected early, the disease usually can be controlled and vision loss prevented with drugs in the form of eye drops, laser treatment or surgery. However, whatever vision is lost can not be restored. The disease usually has no early warning signs, though it sometimes causes loss of side vision, difficulty in adjusting eyes to the dark and a frequent need for new glasses. In its later stages, glaucoma can cause eye pain, blurred vision, seeing halos around lights, nausea and vomiting. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said a study he conducted found glaucoma occurs in blacks at four to five times the rate in whites, while a survey by Dr. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> found the rate as much as six times as high in blacks. Neither study identified the reason blacks are at higher risk than whites. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said the best way to detect glaucoma is through a comprehensive eye exam. Measuring fluid pressure in the eye _ the most common test used in glaucoma screening _ does n't always detect the disease, he said. The coalition launching the campaign includes the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on the Aging, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and Lighthouse.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> today bowed to Christian fundamentalists and unanimously adopted new guidelines on the teaching of evolution that take note of the theory of creation. The board voted 9-0 to approve the guidelines for science textbooks in the biggest school system in the nation, with 4.6 million students. The old guidelines said evolution must be taught in schools, and they offered no guidance to teachers or administrators on dealing with questions from students about the biblical theory of creation. As a result of today's vote, the new guidelines hold that `` some people reject the theory of evolution purely on the basis of religious faith'' and that such `` personal beliefs should be respected and not demeaned.'' However, the new document, unlike the old, gives evolution a central place in science education, arguing in detail the importance of teaching evolution. `` It's very clear in the document that evolution will be taught and creationism will not,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Honig </PERSON>, state superintendent of instruction. The board has been at the center of a struggle with national implications that pits religious groups against science teachers and administrators who say the theory of evolution is no more controversial than gravity or electricity. In 1985, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> education authorities successfully demanded that publishers devote more space to evolution, and those revised textbooks are now being used in schools across the country. In September, the original guidelines were declared a `` national victory for science over dogma'' by <PERSON> Micheal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, Western states director for the Washington-based People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, a civil liberties group. The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> voted on the guidelines after they were amended Wednesday by the board's Policy and <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Eugenie </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, said the policy adopted by the commission was `` slightly weaker'' on evolution than a draft prepared in September by a state panel. `` It's a concession to board members who are knuckling under to right-wing religious pressure,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> said the wording was changed from an earlier draft to make it less offensive to those who believe <PERSON> God </PERSON> created the universe. Specifically, a sentence was struck that read: `` There is no scientific dispute that evolution has occurred and continues to occur; this is why evolution is regarded as a scientific fact.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Traditional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Values </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> said creation theory supporters were given `` crumbs from the table'' in the amendments. Evolution may no longer be called fact directly in the document, `` but it says that in other ways,'' he said. The guidelines provide a detailed explanation of how science should be taught in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> schools. The framework does not mandate course content, which is determined by local school boards, but sets standards and goals, and influences textbook publishers.

 Calling discrimination against AIDS patients `` absolutely unacceptable,'' Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> issued a new call Thursday for anti-discrimination legislation. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, speaking at a conference on AIDS and minorities, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is committed to seeing acquired immune deficiency syndrome covered under legislation pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the Americans With Disabilities Act. `` This administration is committed to enacting legislation to prohibit such discrimination,'' he said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said AIDS has become a `` special problem'' of the nation's poor and minorities, but added, `` This sort of us-versus-them thinking _ this is dangerous.'' The secretary was on friendly turf at the conference, which was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, an alumnus of <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, was founding president of the medical school before he was appointed to the Cabinet by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said part of the onus of stopping AIDS _ transmitted chiefly through sex or drug paraphernalia _ rests with individuals, to `` think and behave in a more constructive way'' with `` moderation, self-control and discipline.'' He called for a `` new ethic of personal responsibility, a new culture of character,'' not just for AIDS but for other problems such as teen pregnancy and homicide. `` It can not be brought about by federal mandate,'' he said. He also addressed the overload of AIDS patients at medical facilities from coast to coast. `` AIDS has not caused a crisis in our health care system,'' he said. `` AIDS has simply revealed the pre-existing cracks in the system. `` We have not yet made health care sufficiently available to all American citizens. ... We must work to put our entire health care system in order.''

 The African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-apartheid organization outlawed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, opened an office here Thursday trying to improve relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thabo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s Director of International Affairs, said the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office would seek to persuade the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to impose additional economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> told reporters the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, in marked contrast to its predecessor, believes the existing sanctions have already forced the South African government to liberalize its policies toward the country's black majority. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said recently that while the administration opposes harsher sanctions at this time, it would be willing to consider them if no progress is made toward black-white negotiations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by next summer. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration differs with its predecessor on another point. `` Clearly the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has moved away from the notion that the South African government must be pacified, pampered, pleased,'' he said at a news conference. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s meetings with prominent anti-apartheid leaders such as Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> are important, <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> said, `` the greatest contribution <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could and should make is further sanctions.'' The sanctions were imposed in 1986 by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, after it overrode a veto by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> opened a similar office in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last year, and already has about 40 representatives abroad, <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, whose father <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> was one of seven top <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> officials released from prison last week after 25 years in captivity, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appears committed to pushing for an end to the racial discrimination policies in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> had been encouraged by administration officials to open its office here `` because they know we are central to the solution of the South African problem.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is concerned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may let up pressure on newly elected President F.W. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who has been liberalizing his government's policies toward blacks but has rejected giving them the vote and maintains wide powers of arrest and censorship. If that turns out to be the case, <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> said, `` we have to resurrect'' the pressure. Conservatives in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> contend the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is funded by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and that its armed wing is supplied by the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> said there would always be `` those who do n't like us'' but that the question of Soviet support was `` not an issue'' with the administration. In 1987, then-Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>. Regular meetings have been conducted with the group's representatives ever since.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said today it was opening its borders to the rest of the world and that its citizens can travel or emigrate anywhere, including through the 28-year-old Berlin Wall. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo, said that those who want to visit other countries and then return would still need a visa, but that the visa requests would be handled without delay. The stunning announcement comes on the heels of a remarkable series of events that has shaken this once rigidly controlled Communist nation. Earlier today, new leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> both called for free and democratic elections, the main demand of a widening opposition movement. Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> ousted the Politburo and replaced aging hard-liners with reformers in a desperate move to counter daily public unrest and the mass flight of tens of thousands of East Germans to the West. Communist leaders also decided today to consider even more changes in the government hierarchy. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> set a party conference for Dec. A party conference, a forum for making major changes in party policy, was last held in 1956. The official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the conference would discuss personnel changes in the 163-member Central Committee. The move to open the borders comes after decades of fencing East Germans in to prevent their flight to the West. The Berlin Wall has divided <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and the two German nations since 1961. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said free travel for East Germans would be a `` very positive development'' that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would welcome. `` We've been talking a long time about freedom of travel being a basic human right. We've been talking a long time about open borders. We've been talking a long time about the importance of seeing the wall come down,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> said those who want to emigrate can go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> directly without having to go through a third country. More than 50,000 East Germans have fled through neighboring <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> since Saturday and about 200,000 have fled this year. <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that the decision was made during a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting. He said the decision means all East Germans `` can travel over all East German border checkpoints.'' While stunning changes have taken place at the top, daily street protests have continued almost unabated for the last several weeks. About 40,000 people demonstrated Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Neubrandenburg </LOCATION> and near <LOCATION> Karl-Marx-Stadt </LOCATION> for free elections and an end to authoritarian one-party rule, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. In the first official Soviet comment since <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> reshuffled the country's top leadership, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told a news briefing in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> today that it was clear <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was undertaking a `` renewal of socialism. `` They're improving the situation in the sense that they're moving toward perestroika on their own terms,'' he told a news briefing, referring to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s current program of reforms <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> touched on the volatile topic of multiparty elections in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that was published today in state newspapers. He called for a `` new election law that ensures free, democratic general elections with a secret ballot. He proposed `` public supervision in every stage of the balloting.'' <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> did not say whether he was urging a true multiparty system in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Officials already say elections are democratic, even though the system guarantees the Communists virtually unanimous approval. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> also promised new laws on freedom of assembly, assocation and the press, but gave no details. However, he did say independent groups might have a role in the nation's politics as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> tries to recover from the shock of losing more than 200,000 mostly young, skilled workers to the West this year. <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> said earlier today that the Communists were ready to go into free elections `` without any limits.'' `` If we profess free elections here, then we are professing free elections without any limits and with all risks that are connected,'' <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> told <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Westdeutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s pro-democracy opposition groups have made free elections their main demand, although <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly said that any changes ca n't jeopardize the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s `` leading role.'' Party dominance also is embodied in the nation's constitution and a constitutional change would be required to abolish it <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON>, leader of the small <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party that previously had closely followed Communist policy, also called for free elections today. Writing in the party's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, he questiioned whether the constitutional article that guarantees the party's leading role `` could still stand.'' Meanwhile, a group of 15 prominent <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Communist intellectuals and officials wrote a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> suggesting the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall be torn down in the near future. `` It is also imaginable, even in the foreseeable future, that the wall will become a relic of the past'' if an agreement is signed with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that would prevent `` damage to the East German economy,'' the group said. The letter appeared today in the <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON>, a newspaper of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organization. Among those who signed it were <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, secretary for economy with the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> party leadership, and <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Reissig </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Communist authorities built the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> in 1961 to stop an exodus to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. It became a symbol of the differences between East and West, differences that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has sought to erase by urging reforms in the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, who assumed power just three weeks ago, on Wednesday purged much of the old guard from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo. The 21-member body was reduced to 11. The leadership reshuffle swept aside nine aging Politburo members and brought in four new ones, including <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>. Seen as a reformer, <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> was proposed as the new premier when the 44-person Cabinet resigned en masse Tuesday.

<HEAD>Pentagon: Soviets Suspected of Aiming Lasers at U.S. Aircraft</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials suspect the Soviets of shooting lasers at American planes in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> recently, damaging the eyesight of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> crewman in one of four incidents, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday. An agreement signed last summer by top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet military officials is designed to avoid such military encounters, but it does not go into effect until Jan. 1. Pentagon officials said privately they were dismayed that such incidents could be continuing in the meantime. At a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing, spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said two Soviet vessels `` may have'' aimed lasers at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft on Oct. 17, Oct. 28 and in two separate incidents on Nov. 1 over waters off <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Asked whether the matter affected U.S.-Soviet ties, which have been improving, the spokesman said only, `` I will not characterize the incident beyond describing it.'' Meanwhile, other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said the matters are being investigated, and some expressed irritation that such activity may be continuing despite the agreement that is about to take effect. One senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official, commenting on condition of anonymity, said laser activity is suspected because of past incidents and because of descriptions provided by the military personnel involved in the most recent cases. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he could not identify a Soviet vessel involved. Pentagon sources said, however, that it was a military ship that was in the waters where Soviets have traditionally observed the splashdowns for their missile tests. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes traditionally observe the movements of such Soviet ships, the sources said. Lasers are sometimes used as rangefinders to target enemy aircraft. The afflicted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crewman _ a loadmaster aboard an HC-130 aircraft _ suffered disruption of his color vision, headaches and other visual problems and is under medical evaluation, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources said. The crewman had been wearing `` laser eye protection'' gear at the time, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are also investigating why the damage could occur despite that equipment, the sources said. In 1987, the copilot of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> WC-135 suffered vision problems when she observed a nearby <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reconnaissance aircraft `` illuminated'' by a laser that was determined to have come from the Soviet ship <LOCATION> Chukotka </LOCATION>. The vessel was operating off <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, near the target zone of a Soviet missile test. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said at the time the crew member's vision was affected for about 10 minutes and that the damage was not believed permanent. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> noted that it is now standard procedure for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel in such areas to wear protective eye gear in order to avoid damage from the intense beams of light. He offered these details of the most recent incidents: _ On Oct. 17, the injured crewman aboard an HC-130 experienced `` what may have been possible laser illumination'' about 1,200 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> as the plane was observing a Soviet ship _ On Oct. 28, the flight crew of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> P-3 observation plane again reported the possible laser illumination from the same Soviet vessel, then about 1,800 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> No injuries were reported from that sighting. _ On Nov. 1, another <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> HC-130, flying about 1,000 miles west of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, again reported possible laser illumination from a Soviet vessel A few minutes later, a similar report was received from an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> WC-130, a four-engine weather observation plane, located 780 miles south of the first aircraft. Again, no injuries were reported. The fourth incident was connected with the Soviet ship involved in the first two incidents, but a second Soviet ship may have been involved in the initial Nov. 1 illumination, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The HC-130 Hercules four-engine turboprops are often used for surveillance purposes. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources said that because no official determination has yet been made that lasers were involved _ and since the new U.S.-Soviet agreement is not yet in effect _ no protests have been filed with Soviet officials. One official noted that following the similar type of incident in 1987, a protest was filed under a 1972 `` incidents at sea'' agreement. The pact that takes effect Jan. 1, worked out in nine months of negotiations, covered four points and was designed to allow for `` communications to avoid and resolve'' military incidents between superpower military forces. The agreement dealt with the accidental straying of military units into the other nation's territory; hazardous use of laser range finders that could blind the other country's soldiers or sailors; hampering the other country's military operations in a tense area such as the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and interfering with command and communications networks of the two militaries. Pentagon officials said the pact included lasers because of the 1987 incident.

<HEAD>Soviets Plan Military Rummage Sale of Scrapped Missile Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Missile carriers, generators and mobile barracks will go up for grabs in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> park this month at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first equivalent of a military rummage sale, organizers said Thursday. The exhibit, which opens Nov. 28, is aimed at selling off reusable parts of intermediate-range nuclear missile installations that were dismantled under a 1987 superpower treaty. It is also meant to pave the way for broader sales of equipment that will no longer be needed as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> cuts its military forces and future treaties rule out other types of weapons, said <PERSON> Elvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON>, one of the fair's organizers. The money the fair is expected to bring in this year will go in part to help support servicemen who are discharged as a result of the cutbacks, <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is in the process of reducing troops and tanks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and it has shifted from aggressive arms-race rhetoric to espousing a doctrine of `` reasonable sufficiency.'' It has already destroyed 297 of its 654 SS-20s under the 1987 treaty and the rest are due to be scrapped over the next two years. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, keeping pace, has eliminated 486 of its 846 rockets covered by the treaty. The proceeds from the military sale will also be used to raise the living standards of soldiers remaining in the army and to charity, said <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON>, who heads Intellect, a foundation aimed at encouraging creativity among youth that is one of the charities to benefit from the sale. Foreigners will be allowed to buy most of the military goods on sale at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sokolniki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, and some of the offerings will be put up for auction. The several hundred items at the fair will include the heavy-terrain vehicles used as missile carriers, radio and electrical elements, generators, measuring devices, frames, pipes, condensers and other miscellanea. <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> said the missile carriers could be used to transport construction cranes or vats of fertilizer on farms and the mobile living units that housed the missile installation crews could be used by geologists in the field. The pipes and electrical supplies are assured plenty of Soviet buyers because of the widespread shortage of construction materials, <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> noted. Much of the equipment which was part of the nuclear missile installations has never been used, he added. `` If it had been, we would n't be sitting here,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Spares Teen From Jail in Son's Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A 16-year-old mother of three who had been abused most of her life was spared prison for the beating death of her son by a judge who said putting her behind bars would only continue the cycle of abuse. <PERSON> Tammie </PERSON> <PERSON> Janette </PERSON> <PERSON> Loray </PERSON> was sentenced Wednesday to three years in a juvenile center on a no-contest plea Aug. 30 to second-degree murder in the beating death of her 5-month-old son, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` If I take some other action now, I will not be breaking the cycle of abuse. I will be perpetuating it,'' acting Circuit Judge <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said. The girl had been sexually abused by her adoptive father from age 4 to 11, abandoned twice by her adoptive mother and given to other men before age 10. The judge told the teen-ager that her case `` involves the death of two children because it seems to me you never had a childhood.'' He sentenced her as a juvenile on the murder charge and as an adult for aggravated child abuse. With 15 years' probation on the abuse count, Miss Loray will be under the court's jurisdiction until age 34. The prosecution wanted <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Loray </PERSON> sentenced as an adult to 17 years in prison, and the defense asked that she be placed in treatment for three years with no probation. Miss Loray and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> took <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to an emergency room March 4, 1988, where he died four days later, authorities said. Her other son, <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, was born Oct. 7, 1988, the day she was indicted. Her first child, <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, suffered brain damage in September 1986. Authorities said the 3-month-old had been violently shaken. No charges were filed. Psychologists, foster parents and state social workers testified that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Loray </PERSON> is immature and suffers from severe depression and low self-esteem. The judge warned the girl she faced prison if she failed to cooperate during treatment or refused to complete programs thought necessary by her parole officer.

<HEAD>NATO Prepares for Possible Withdrawals from Warsaw Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday put final touches on a plan that it said would curb conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and ease the path of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries that decide to leave the Soviet bloc military alliance. Negotiators for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said the proposals contained several new provisions placing more emphasis on individual countries within the two military alliances. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, who spoke outside the opening session of the winter round of East-West non-nuclear arms talks, said the new Western package defined the talks as between `` groups of states'' instead of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact alliances. `` This is a development away from alliances and toward individual states'' at the 23-nation talks, said chief delegate <PERSON> Ruediger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A Western delegate who spoke on condition of anonymity acknowledged the change of emphasis was in anticipation of possible future moves by some <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries to leave the Soviet-led alliance of seven nations. Several Hungarian leaders have suggested in recent months that their <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact country might opt for neutrality in the foreseable future as part of its reform process transforming it from communist rule to multiparty democracy. The delegate indirectly acknowledged Hungarian developments influenced the new language of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposals. He said some countries contemplating a move away from the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> would be reluctant to sign a treaty binding them to an alliance they could soon be outside of. <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON>, in the same vein, said that `` some Eastern nations now -LRB- are -RRB- not ready to assume responsibilities for the whole East bloc.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> package thus proposes country-by-country limits on weapons categories instead of only two ceilings _ one for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, the other for the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, said the delegates. It also would permit any individual country belonging to one of the two alliances to unilaterally withdraw from a conventional arms treaty if its supreme interests were jeopardized. Chief Soviet negotiator <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON> told another news conference he was reluctant to comment on the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposals before seeing them, but he appeared cool to the `` group of states'' concept. `` It's possible to have some quotas for each country,'' he said, when asked about individual country limits as opposed to alliance ceilings. `` But the agreement -LRB- should be -RRB- ... between the two alliances.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposals were to be presented at Thursday's opening round. But a Western delegate said last-minute disagreement among the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> on their language meant they would likely be submitted next week. While the proposals remain confidential, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> negotiators said they contained modified versions of suggestions made by the Western side since the talks opened in March, including: _ Limiting the size of military exercises to no more than 40,000 troops per bloc _ Mandatory advance notification of major mobilization of reservists and of large troop movements _ Mandatory easy access to specific weapons depots with up to one-fifth of each side's arsenals and simplified surveillance of equipment in units with a low level of readiness. The East already has agreed to the 40,000-person limit on maneuvers but has sought to limit such large exercises to once every three years instead of once every two years, as proposed by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> earlier.

The <ORGANIZATION> Berthoud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tunnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> had hoped to sell $ 247 million in tax-exempt bonds in December for planning and construction of the 4-mile tunnel, which would spare motorists from having to drive a fearsome, zigzag road over the 11,315-foot gap. But <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, authority president, said Wednesday that a budget bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in October requires that 85 percent of tax-exempt bonds be used within five years of sale. `` That stops the project dead in its tracks,'' he said. Construction is n't scheduled to start until 1992 and the tunnel is n't due to open until 1996. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> has asked members of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation to seek an exemption to the restrictions. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the bill does not include the restriction.

<TEXT>
 Ferry passengers Thursday recounted the panic after a freighter hit their ship and killed three people, but the owners said more may have died if an after-dinner dance had not been delayed. The <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, a Danish ferry bound for <LOCATION> Harwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, with nearly 400 people aboard, was rammed by the 8,206-ton Panama-registered Nordic Stream in high winds and rough seas south of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Helgoland </LOCATION> on Wednesday night. Three passengers _ two Britons and one German _ died and 11 people were injured when the container ship's bow punched a 60-foot gash into the ferry's hull, according to the vessel's owner, Danish Scandinavian Seaways. `` I was in the lounge just having a drink. The next thing we knew we were flying through the air and tables and chairs and glass were flying about,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Peart </PERSON>, one of a group of British passengers. `` There was a lot of panic, people were picking themselves up off the floor and dashing to the nearest exit and trampling over everybody,'' said <PERSON> Peart </PERSON>, 37. `` People thought it was going to sink.'' Witnesses said parts of the ferry's dance lounge were hanging out of the hole in the hull. The freighter's deck was littered with cocktail chairs from the ferry. The lounge was nearly empty when the crash occurred because the leader of the ship's band was feeling sick and had postponed a scheduled dance by half an hour, Seaways officials said. The ferry was only about one-third full. The West German <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said sea traffic controllers had warned both boats they were sailing dangerously close to one another. The cause of the crash was still under investigation, a ministry statement said. Six seriously injured people from the ferry were flown by helicopter to land for treatment before the <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> limped into <LOCATION> Bremerhaven </LOCATION>. West German authorities said the crash occurred as the <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> was steaming out to sea and the <LOCATION> Nordic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION> was headed toward the <LOCATION> Elbe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> in the direction of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> harbor. A storm warning was in effect at the time. Scandinavian Seaways said the ferry was carrying 96 crew members and 277 passengers, including 60 Britons, 192 Germans, 16 <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> and nine others of unidentified nationality. The ferry, which can carry 1,000 people, sails every two days between <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Harwich </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Senate Sends Bush Congressional Mailings Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday sent President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a bill to save congressional newsletters, reversing a previous vote to ban the mailings that had touched off a congressional civil war. The compromise, negotiated earlier in a bitter House-Senate conference, was adopted by voice vote and will halve the number of unsolicited mass mailings from six-to-three per lawmaker. On Sept. 7, in an action that enraged the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, senators voted 88-7 for an amendment to ban the mass mailings and give the estimated $ 45 million in savings to a treatment program for pregnant women with drug addictions. But senators knew that vote was preliminary, and faced with nearly identical language Thursday they voted 66-29 to kill the proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. The lawmakers then adopted the $ 1.9 billion appropriations bill for congressional operations that includes the compromise mail provisions. The mailings in question, usually newsletters, are addressed to postal patrons rather than individual constituents and increase greatly during election years. The September <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote to ban the mailings led to ruffled feelings that saw members of each house threaten _ and back off _ from proposals to change the other's rules. Senators did n't like the idea that only their rules require disclosure of mailing costs by each member, and sought to force House disclosure. House members threatened to retaliate by trying to end senators' use of money from honoraria, political action committees and party campaign committees for office expenses House rules prohibit such expenditures. In the end, the compromise sent to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> includes a package of reforms in the congressional mail system. The measure would establish for the first time separate <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> mail accounts; limit the size of newsletters to two sheets of paper; establish a voluntary procedure for keeping mail costs within their budget; and strictly enforce a prohibition against postal patron mailings 60 days before an election. The compromise would budget $ 100.2 million for mailings, including $ 44.5 million for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, $ 23.9 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the remainder to pay the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for mailings that exceeded the fiscal 1989 mail budget. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., arguing for the ban on mailings, told colleagues to ask themselves `` how often you've been begged for a newsletter. `` No wonder the public grows cynical when they see us putting our perks ... above their needs,'' he said. `` They did not elect us to put junk mail ahead of ... treatment'' for pregnant women addicted to drugs. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the government only spent $ 4.5 million during the last fiscal year for the treatment, and would have added $ 45 million in savings from the mailing ban. However, those opposing <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> already has approved $ 85 million for the program in the current fiscal year. Sen. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, D-Nev., sponsor of the compromise that was adopted, said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would never accept the mailing ban and would back away from the other mail reforms if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> changed the agreement The result, he said, would be no congressional mail reforms. `` It's the best we're going to get,'' he said.

 Former dairy princess <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> was ordered Thursday to stand trial in the strangling of a former schoolmate during a quarrel over a boyfriend. Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>, 20, of rural <PERSON> Hatley </PERSON>, is charged with first-degree intentional homicide. The 1989 Marathon County dairy princess is accused of strangling <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Birnamwood </LOCATION> during an argument Sept. 20 in Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON>'s car. She resigned as dairy princess after being charged and is free on bail. Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> smiled as she entered court Thursday. She wrote in a notebook during the proceedings and visited with several friends afterward. Marathon County Circuit Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> set a Dec. 1 hearing for Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> to make a plea to the charge. Her attorney, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON>, said the three-week delay in entering a plea was granted because prosecutors may decide to file a different charge. No plea negotiations have started, <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said, `` but that does n't mean we are not going to have conversations.'' <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> has filed court documents contending that statements Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> gave detectives violated her constitutional right against self-incrimination. Sheriff's Detective <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoenisch </PERSON> testified Thursday Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> told authorities Sept. 29 that she killed Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON> after Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON> `` grabbed her and shook her.'' <PERSON> Hoenisch </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> sobbed as she recounted how the fight between her and Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON> broke out while the two talked about their relationships with <PERSON> Eland </PERSON> dairy farmer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Buss </PERSON>, 25. Friends have said <PERSON> Buss </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>'s one-time boyfriend, was about to become engaged to Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON>. The two women were in a car parked outside a <LOCATION> Wausau </LOCATION> hotel where Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON> worked when the fight erupted, authorities said. Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>, a junior at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION>, told detectives she implied she was pregnant by <PERSON> Buss </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON> responded angrily and `` grabbed at her hair and grabbed at her neck,'' Hoenisch testified. <PERSON> Hoenisch </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> told him she feared for her life. Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> told investigators at one point she pulled Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON> down on the seat of the car and `` pinned her there by putting a forearm around her throat,'' <PERSON> Hoenisch </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> said she saw a belt in the back of the car, grabbed it and `` put it on <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON>'s neck,'' <PERSON> Hoenisch </PERSON> said, adding that Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> dumped out a purse and found a mirror to check whether Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON> was breathing. `` She told us she did n't mean to hurt her,'' the detective testified. More than 150 people packed the courtroom Thursday, including <PERSON> Buss </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON>'s parents, Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>'s parents and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION> dairy farmer recently acquitted on charges he participated in the 1987 <PERSON> Kunz </PERSON> family killings in nearby <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The Contras announced a new military-dominated commission Wednesday to lead the Nicaraguan rebels, but ousted civilian leaders immediately denounced the move as a coup. The formation of the `` civilian-military commission,'' as the group calls itself, came as the Contras and Sandinista government opened talks at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> aimed at ending the civil war in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The new Contra leaders include three military commanders and <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, a civilian holdover from the old seven-member directorate. `` The commission was formed by military commanders ... because of the disintegration of the the old directorate,'' Contra military spokesman <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> said. Three of the seven civilian directors have returned to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has cut off funds to the old directorate, and most of the Contra supply and demobilization effort is already in the hands of the military, he said. <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> added that the Contra's <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> negotiating team has recognized the new commission. But two of the civilian directors, who were elected by the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>'s 54-member legislative assembly, quckly denounced the body as a power grab that violated the Contras' internal rules `` The intervention of the military in civilian matters has always been a great problem in our country,'' said <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, who was a leader of the resistance since it was formed in the early 1980s. `` I want respect for insitutions, and for the military to keep in their headquarters and do their duty.'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> blamed the takeover on the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which he said had undercut the directorate to favor military commanders. `` They have a short memory on how the military has screwed up before,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did not immediately return calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON>, another civilian director, said the new commission was supposed to work under the directorate, not replace it. `` The disbanding of the directorate would violate the statutes of the assembly, and I consider that a coup which creates a serious precedent,'' said <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON>. Members of the new commission, however, defended the body and said it was necessary because the directorate had ceased functioning. Commander <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, the Contra's military chief of staff and a member of the commission, issued a statement saying the goals of the movement had not changed. He and the other two military leaders, Commanders <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dimas </PERSON>, are known only by their battlefield psuedonyms. The new leaders will do `` everything necessary to fulfill the historic goals of our organization _ achieving peace and national reconciliation through the full democratization of Nicaraguan society,'' <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said. Asked about the old directors, <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> noted that if military commanders agree, there is an option to expand the commission to seven members, and it is possible former directors could join. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, however, rejected the possibility. `` I would be doing a disservice to democracy if I approved, and I will not,'' he said.

 The White House said today a decision by the East German government to allow its citizens to travel freely was an important step toward democratic reform. `` We have always called for and supported freedom of movement,'' said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` The East German decision would be an important step in the direction of peaceful and evolutionary democratic reform. It would seem to be a positive response to the wishes that the East German people have voiced so strongly in the last few months,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said free travel for East Germans would be a `` very positive development'' that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would welcome. `` We've been talking a long time about freedom of travel being a basic human right. We've been talking a long time about open borders. We've been talking a long time about the importance of seeing the wall come down,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He spoke to reporters after hosting a luncheon for <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said today it was opening its borders to the rest of the world and that its citizens can travel or emigrate anywhere, including through the 28-year-old Berlin Wall. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` The country appears to have been moving in that direction, but I think it was a surprise when it happened. At least we had no advance warning.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, ssaid the East German decision amounts to `` the symbolic destruction of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to `` take the final step and tear that wall down.'' Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said `` the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and all that it represents are crumbling, even as the communist state which built it crumbles, too.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should make clear its desire that the East German people achieve freedom and that the country's communist government be replaced by a functioning democracy. `` But we should not do anything at this point which might needlessly add fuel to the fire,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said providing food, clothing and housing for the refugees does `` present problems.'' `` I think all the countries of the world, certainly the allied countries, stand ready to watch and help as necessary. But at this point that has n't been required,'' said the White House spokesman. So far, he said, `` the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government has been managing this exodus into their country pretty well.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> have talked previously about the situation. `` We have always urged movements toward democracy. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called for tearing down the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> wall. We have been supportive of the border release of its citizens and we think those are important moves.''

<TEXT>
 Border issues spurred by dramatic developments in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and a conflict over Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> dominated the first day of his historic visit to post-communist <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s talks with Solidarity Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> upon arrival for a six-day visit were `` extremely open'' and wide-ranging, according to spokesmen for both governments. But the increasingly topical issue of eventual German reunification appeared to be the focus of the nearly two hours of discussion between <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. `` Certainly <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is now looking more seriously on the possibility of this,'' said Polish government spokesman <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Wozniakowski </PERSON>. `` The horizon of possible reunification is more visible than a few months ago.'' The chief Polish government spokesman, <PERSON> Malgorzata </PERSON> <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s information minister, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, made clear that border issues dominated the talks. Polish officials have been concerned about discussion among West German conservatives of the possibility of seeking reunification within the 1937 borders of the German Reich, which would involve large areas now part of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The West German parliament Wednesday proposed a resolution that appears to recognize the areas of <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION> as permanent parts of the <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Polish officials expressed satisfaction with that, but in an indication the issue remains sensitive, they pressed the West German visitors for more concrete assurances that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> does not covet the territories now a part of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a member of the arch-conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> tried to explain to <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> the continuing sensitivities among Germans expelled from their homelands in territories awarded to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after World War II. `` It is necessary to win these people over,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said, referring to those still unwilling to recognize the permanent loss of their homelands. Ms. <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> `` stressed that Polish people must have certainty that the question of borders be settled permanently.'' A 1970 treaty between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> recognizes the <PERSON> Oder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neisse </PERSON> rivers as the western boundary of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but does not commit an eventually reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to those terms. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also met with Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is bringing a billion-dollar economic package that is crucial for the Solidarity-led government to make the difficult transition toward a market-oriented economy. The new government and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> have argued for massive Western economic aid, saying it is needed to secure the fragile democratic process under way. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s largest Western trading partner and <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has brought business leaders with him to start developing joint projects. Earlier Thursday, sources disclosed that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visit to the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp had been delayed because the head of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Jewish community said he could not take part in the event on the <LOCATION> Sabbath </LOCATION>. West German officials with the <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> delegation said before the chancellor's arrival for a six-day summit that the visit originally set for Saturday was delayed because of objections by <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, head of the West German Jewish Community Council. <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, a member of the official delegation, told the West German government that in accordance with Jewish religious customs, he would not be able to travel Saturday, the sources said. On Thursday, Polish and West German officials responsible for arranging the trip in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> held an emergency meeting to resolve the delicate problem before <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s arrival. <PERSON> Jaroslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Szczepanski </PERSON>, deputy director of the government press office, said there was mutual agreement to make the change. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> said it appeared the trip could not be fit in until Tuesday. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> already is committed to a visit Sunday to <LOCATION> Krzyzowa </LOCATION>, a Silesian town where <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> resisters met during the war, for a meeting with ethnic Germans. Polish and West German leaders hope the visit will mark a new beginning in relations between the former World War II adversaries, but the trip has been marred by controversy. Memories of old territorial disputes and the legacy of the Nazi era still cast shadows over efforts at reconciliation. Polish anxiety over a planned visit by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Gora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anny </PERSON>, known in German as <PERSON> Annaberg </PERSON>, the site of a bloody battle in 1921 over whether the area should go to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, forced officials to find another place for a meeting with ethnic Germans Polish officials apparently feared that a visit by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to the once disputed city could fuel ethnic tension in the area. West Germans have expressed concern that the rights of the ethnic German minority are not being respected by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Hindus Begin Building Temple at Disputed Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AYODHYA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With a superficial scratching of earth and placement of four bricks, <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalists Thursday reaffirmed their intention to build a temple that has stirred a religious and political storm. Outnumbered by police and paramilitary troops surrounding the site, about 2,000 Hindu holy men, politicians, worshipers and youthful, unarmed guards mobbed a patch of earth considered sacred by Hindus and Moslems. Tens of thousands of other Hindu faithfuls streamed by behind the ceremony site outside a police barricade. Hindus planned a formal start to dig the foundation on Friday. At least 290 people have died in Hindu-Moslem clashes since August when Hindu fundamentalists announced they would build a new temple to the god Ram on the site of an existing 17th century mosque. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which is behind the temple program, maintains the mosque was built atop an ancient Hindu temple marking the spot where the group says <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> was born 900,000 years ago. Most of the deaths occurred late last month in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state, next to <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state, as bricks for the temple were borne by Hindu processions to this dusty town on the <LOCATION> Saryu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. There have been no reports of deaths in <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION>, and there was no sign of violence in the town of 35,000 on Thursday. The <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION> case has become a major campaign issue for Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> as he seeks to return his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to power in elections that will be conducted Nov. 22, 24 and 26. But neither he nor the man trying to replace him, <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, has offered a solution. They are fearful of alienating the vote of Hindus, who make up 82 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 milliion people, although Hindus traditionally have voted for secular parties. The candidates also want the Moslem vote, which usually has gone heavily to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> had planned to visit <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION> on Thursday to cool religious tensions, but changed his plans and made a short stop in <LOCATION> Faizabad </LOCATION>, about four miles away. In <LOCATION> Faizabad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said the Hindu-Moslem dispute over the <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION> site `` can not be decided by the courts.'' He declined to say how it should be decided. The question of proprietorship at <LOCATION> Ayodhya </LOCATION> has been dragging through the courts for four decades. So far the only thing legally clear is that the initial foundation for the new temple is slated for a 25-foot-by-23-foot plot owned by a Hindu. This tiny plot could hold little more than the front steps of the proposed temple. The rest of the envisoned two-story, three-domed structure would engulf land whose ownership is under dispute, including the 17th century mosque. `` We will not break down this structure,'' said <PERSON> Ashok </PERSON> <PERSON> Singhal </PERSON>, referring to the the building Moslems call the Babri Masjid, or Mosque of <PERSON> Babar </PERSON>. Hindus call it the <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Janambhoomi </PERSON>, or Ram's birthplace `` It can be lifted _ honorably lifted _ and moved, so this mosque, if it is a mosque, is not destroyed,'' said <PERSON> Singhal </PERSON>, a senior trustee of the committee to build the new Hindu temple. <PERSON> Singhal </PERSON> said he hoped to make such an attempt and begin contruction within a month, leaving the impression that it would be deferred until after a new government is chosen.

<HEAD>Bishops Urge Palestinian Homeland, Approve AIDS Statement</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops Thursday called upon the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to press for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> talks leading to an independent Palestinian homeland. The statement drew immediate criticism from Jewish leaders. On the last day of its fall meeting, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> also approved a statement on AIDS that rejects condom education in public schools and the distribution of clean needles to drug addicts. The bishops unanimously approved a statement on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> that declares Palestinians have a right to participate as equals in negotiations affecting their destiny and a right to territory. The statement called upon the Arab states and Palestinians to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, and said there must be limits negotiated on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> sovereignty to protect <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. The bishops urged the administration to increase talks with Palestinians, `` clearly'' express its support for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland, press <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states to normalize relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and urge all foreign nations, including <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to withdraw from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said the statement is a `` sorely needed invitation to dialogue for the cause of peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' But it drew criticism from American Jewish groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> Synagogue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which said the bishops' report `` prejudges what can only be achieved through the process of negotiations.'' Rabbi <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the bishops' call for sovereignty `` removes incentives for flexibility and accommodation on the part of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership.'' The AIDS statement approved in a 219-4 vote by secret ballot rejected the bishops' conference's earlier conditional support for condom education in public schools, urging that youngsters be taught chastity instead. `` We caution young people not to be trapped into the ` safe-sex' myth, which is both a lie and a fraud,'' said Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, chairman of the committee that drafted the statement The statement also opposes universal mandatory AIDS testing, calls for increasing federal funds for AIDS research, and denounces violence and discrimination against AIDS patients. The statement said it builds on a 1987 document approved by the conference's <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, but it drops a controversial assertion in the earlier document that the church could tolerate education about condoms in public school AIDS-prevention classes, as long as sexual abstinence outside marriage was presented as the `` only morally correct and medically sure way'' to prevent the deadly disease. Some bishops said the assertion could be misinterpreted as condoning extramarital sex and artificial birth control. Archbishop <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, newly elected conference president, said in an interview that priests could still counsel condom use in individual cases if it seemed the only recourse, but the bishops decided against a general statement. On similar grounds, the bishops said supplying clean needles to drug addicts to prevent infection from contaminated needles could encourage drug abuse. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Blotcher </PERSON>, a spokesman for the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said not giving youngsters information about condoms is `` abandoning them to death.'' Much of the debate Thursday focused on whether God should be thought of as having a role in determining who gets AIDS. In the end, the bishops rejected several proposed amendments on the matter. `` Without condoning self-destructive behavior or denying personal responsibility, we must reject the idea that this illness is a direct punishment by God,'' the bishops said. In other business Thursday, the prelates voted 175-12 to give bishops the discretion to allow laypeople to assist at marriages where priests or deacons are not available. Earlier in the week, the bishops approved a rite allowing laypeople to conduct Sunday services, though not Mass, in the absence of a priest. Both rules still must be approved by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Also earlier in the week, the bishops: _ Approved a strong anti-abortion resolution, making a special plea to <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> legislators to work to eliminate legalized abortion and saying that no <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> could responsibly take a pro-choice position _ Approved a statement on food policy that decried the loss of the family farm, said the growing concentration of farmland in the hands of large corporations threatens the common good, and called for more rights for farmworkers and less use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides _ Endorsed a plan to increase the participation of black Catholics in the church _ Elected <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>, who had been confererence vice president, to a three-year term as president Archbishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> was elected vice president.

The two pacts _ the 1974 Treaty on the Limitation of Underground Nuclear Weapon Tests and the 1976 Treaty on Underground Nuclear Explosions for Peaceful Purposes _ were signed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but have never been voted on by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Opponents of the treaties as originally negotiated contend that verification provisions in the treaties are insufficient to guarantee against cheating. The two treaties would limit the maximum yield of nuclear test explosions to 150 kilotons. But now, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said, verification technology has advanced to the point that a supplemental agreement on verification procedures appears to be within reach. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, however, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will block an attempt by 41 other nations to amend the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty to establish a comprehensive, permanent ban against all nuclear weapons testing. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will exercise its treaty rights to prevent the transformation of that treaty into a comprehensive test ban in the belief that testing is essential to ensure the reliability of the nation's nuclear deterrent. Test ban advocates disagreed, saying that testing is not needed to make sure nuclear weapons are reliable and asserting that such tests result in the production and deployment of more destructive nuclear arms. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position on nuclear testing is clear,'' Dr. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. `` Nuclear testing is indispensable to the maintenance of the credible nuclear deterrent that has kept the peace for 40 years. ... Testing is necessary to ensure the reliability of our nuclear deterrent and improves the safety, security and survivability of our weapons.'' She said a comprehensive test ban can be contemplated only when deep and verifiable strategic and conventional arms reductions have been achieved. But the committee's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, said that if a complete test ban goes into effect `` the weapons are less likely to be reliable and therefore less likely to be used.''

 An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease suspected of causing 17 illnesses and three deaths after a class reunion has scarred the image of this agricultural community as a wholesome convention site. `` There's concern, grave concern, over what this will mean to the community,'' said <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lamar </ORGANIZATION>, population 8,600, which depends heavily on tourism and conventions. City administrator <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauricello </PERSON> said the town still was reeling from a decision by a bus manufacturer to lay off 200 people last year. Eighty-five people were laid off Monday when the Best Western Cow Palace Inn closed voluntarily while health officials took more than 200 samples from air conditioning ducts, water and the cooling system, breeding grounds for the bacteria that cause the disease. The samples are being analyzed at the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, which expects to have preliminary results next week. Health officials expressed confidence that the Cow Palace will then reopen, after any sources of the bacteria are sterilized. More than 250 people from 21 states attended a <ORGANIZATION> Lamar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> reunion Sept. 22-24, held for classes of 1941 and earlier at the Cow Palace. The motel has about 300 guests per night and brings an average of one convention a week to <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON>, a highway crossroads town 220 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Six cases of Legionnaires' disease have been confirmed among 17 people who came down with pneumonia-like symptoms after attending the reunion. Three of those stricken have died, and two of the deaths involved confirmed cases of Legionnaires'. The other four people with confirmed Legionnaires' disease recovered. Two other people got the disease after staying at the motel prior to the reunion. However, health department officials said Thursday those cases can not be linked directly to the motel. <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON> said all of the cases are suspected to involve Legionnaires' disease, but the health department has to await laboratory confirmation. The health department canvassed those who attended the reunion or worked at the motel, but is not trying to track down other Cow Palace guests. Dr. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said hundreds of people may have been exposed, but only those with compromised immune systems, such as the elderly, catch the disease. Symptoms usually appear in two to 10 days and include fever, headache, appetite loss, muscle aches, coughs, abdominal pain and fluid in the lungs, which sometimes leads to the disease being misdiagnosed as pneumonia. A doctor must confirm the diagnosis with a blood test. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, manager of the motel, said he has lived there for 14 years and neither his family nor employees became ill. Neither have local civic leaders, who attended meetings at the motel. Nevertheless, the motel sat vacant this week, the indoor pool and hot tub empty. A pale green light streamed in through a skylight on dozens of empty tables set for guests. `` I do n't know what we're going to do. I do n't know if we can survive this,'' said <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said the Business and Professional Women of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> canceled its convention after news of the disease broke, costing <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> the money that would have been spent by 250 people. She is worried about the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and state convention of the Knights of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> next spring, but those groups say they have made no decisions to cancel. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said the town is considering an expensive advertising campaign to rebuild its image. `` These things stick in people's minds,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. `` It's not going away next week or next year `` The damage is already done. No matter what the outcome of the investigation, the damage is done.'' <PERSON> Rodrigue </PERSON>, who worked without a mask while collecting samples in the motel, said he would not be afraid to stay there once the source of infection is discovered. Dr. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastro </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said a contamination usually is neutralized with heat or chlorine, but may require continuing periodic treatment. The bacterium is found in soil and grows in water, such as air-conditioning ducts, storage tanks and rivers. Legionnaires' disease takes its name from an outbreak at a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> American Legion convention in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in 1976 that killed 34 people This was the first case in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has completed the dismantling of the electronic barrier along its westernmost border, an official said Thursday. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> began dismantling the electronic signaling devices and barbed wire fencing along its 220-mile border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> on May 2, physically dismantling part of the Iron Curtain between East and West. Brigadier-General <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Szekely </PERSON>, the national commander of the Hungarian border guards, told representatives of 14 political groups that the electronic signaling devices had been removed completely, the state <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. It was not clear from the brief report whether the barbed wire and other fencing has also been removed completely. The removal of all barriers originally was scheduled to be completed by Dec. 1, 1990. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s move to dismantle the border barriers followed legislation allowing Hungarians to travel freely.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers fatally shot an armed Palestinian in a roundup of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas Thursday and killed a masked <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activist during violent protests that erupted after the raid, the military command said. Fifteen other Arabs were shot and wounded in demonstrations as Palestinians marked the end of the 23rd month of a revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. A general strike called by underground uprising leaders paralyzed business and traffic and shut schools throughout the occupied lands. The army command said a military force on routine duties in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> spotted a `` suspicious movement'' near a house in the Jneid neighborhood before dawn Thursday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> media said troops surrounded the one-story house and used a loudspeaker to order the suspects to come out. When they refused, soldiers broke in through a metal door. `` There were six young men inside and one pulled out a pistol. He was shot and killed, and the others were arrested and taken for interrogation,'' an army statement said. The army said the victim, <PERSON> Iman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohsein </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruzeh </PERSON>, and the detainees belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION>, a guerrilla group backed by the radical Syrian-based Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction that opposes <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s peace initiative. The army said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruzeh </PERSON>, 23, was wanted for alleged involvement in the assassinations as well as for firebomb attacks, kidnappings and violent interrogations of suspected collaborators. It said <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuash </PERSON>, 19, wanted by security forces for involvement in the killing of eight <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>, was among the detainees. The Red Eagles are believed responsible for the slayings of nine Nablus Palestinians suspected of `` moral offenses'' or assisting <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, as well as of other attacks against Israeli troops, the army said. `` The nine were killed after severe torture, including killings by axes and knives,'' the statement said. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> has been the site of a large portion of slayings of Arabs accused of helping the Israeli authorities since the uprising began. Of 143 Arabs killed on such charges, 23 were slain in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, with most of the slayings blamed on the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> or another guerrilla group, the Black Panther Brigades. Israeli officials claim some of these gangs operate under direct orders of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, but Palestinians say at least some of the murders were carried out in defiance of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s orders. The raid was followed by violent clashes in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> in which one Palestinian was killed and four others wounded. An Israeli border policeman suffered moderate injuries in a stone-throwing attack after which the army clamped a curfew on the city of 120,000, the largest in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Eleven other Palestinians were shot and wounded in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. Thursday's deaths brought to 613 the number of Arabs killed by Israeli gunfire in the uprising. Forty Israelis have also been slain.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> establishment on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> stood beaming Thursday with <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, clearly pleased to have mainstream elected officials moving into a spotlight once held exclusively by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., and the entire Democratic leadership of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> smiled broadly as <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> stepped forward at a news conference in an ornate room off the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor `` Americans are prepared to accept candidates on the basis of their individual talent,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> needed strong support from white voters and they got it by concentrating on running campaigns that stressed mainstream positions on issues. Both campaigned as fiscal conservatives who were tough on law and order questions. And both kept <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at arms length. Never totally comfortable with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, establishment Democrats dive for cover when he becomes involved with left-wing leaders around the world. Only a week before the 1989 elections, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> called <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to ask him to intervene with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to obtain support for disbanding the Contra forces. <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders can rest easy, aware that neither <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> is likely to get any phone calls from <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. Other 1989 election winners were present _ House members who won contests throughout the year to fill vacancies _ but most of the attention was on <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, who scored racial breakthroughs on Tuesday. While his Republican opponent had yet to concede and a recount was likely, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was claiming victory in the race for governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, a triumph that would make him the first black elected governor of any state. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> is the first black elected mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In both cases, the margin of victory was smaller than many polls had predicted, a result that prompted speculation that race remains a potent issue in American politics. <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the first black to head a major party, dismissed the speculation as ridiculous. `` All the questions now are, ` Why did n't <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> do better?' and ` Why did n't <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> do better?' It's a ridiculous question,'' he said. `` The fact is that we have elected a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> mayor of the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who happens to be black, and we've elected a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor of the state of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, who happens to be black.'' Even as <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> celebrated their triumphs, talk turned to what impact their emergence would have on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the two-time presidential candidate who has been largely unchallenged as the most prominent black in politics. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigned for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Democratic primary but made few appearances for him during the general election campaign and stayed clear of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where he and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> agreed his presence would hurt more than help. After the election, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sounded resentful of the emphasis being placed on the distance <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> put between him and their campaigns. `` We stepped back strategically,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, speculating that if Greeks had risen to prominence in the party after <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 1988 presidential campaign `` no one would be trying to find the disconnection, because the connection would be so very apparent.'' `` If we're members of the same team, does it matter who scored the touchdown,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as he made the rounds of post-election interview shows. `` If we're members of the same team, if we win the championship, all of us get the ring.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who worked briefly on the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> presidential campaign, said the victories of <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> `` have little to do with whether <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is going to be a pre-eminent spokesman. ... I think <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will be a significant factor in the politics of this country for as long as he wants to be.'' <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a think tank that concentrates on studying political trends among blacks, said he doubted <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> would be in a position for some time to challenge <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for pre-eminence as a national figure. As a governor and as mayor of the nation's largest city, they are on `` a different track'' than <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Advisers Cite Possible Major Drawback to Linear Accelerator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Advisers told <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> on Thursday that they have found a possible major drawback to using a linear accelerator instead of nuclear reactors to make tritium, a key ingredient in nuclear warheads. The 12-member <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in an interim report to <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> that the need for huge amounts of electricity to run an accelerator could offset the machine's environmental, safety and possible cost advantages over nuclear reactors. The panel is still studying the matter and is due to issue a final report next February. If substantiated, the panel's interim finding could add weight to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's argument _ challenged by some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ that new nuclear reactors, not an accelerator, are the best answer to the nation's tritium needs. The administration has proposed spending $ 6.8 billion to build two new reactors. A linear accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target, in this case lithium clad in aluminium. The resulting collision produces tritium, a radioactive gas used in nuclear weapons to boost the warhead's explosive power. Government-owned nuclear reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Site </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> are the only source of tritium for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear warheads. Those reactors, built in the early 1950s, have been idled for repairs and safety improvements, and they are not expected to last much beyond 2000. The administration says new production capacity is needed to assure the readiness of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear arsenal, although some nuclear scientists dispute that. In the face of the administration's opposition to the accelerator option, scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> national laboratories and at <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse-Hanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state said earlier this year that an accelerator could produce needed amounts of tritium more cheaply, quickly and safely than new reactors. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> then asked the advisory board for an independent assessment of an accelerator's potential. In its report, the board said one of its chief concerns is that a linear accelerator would require between 800 megawatts and 900 megawatts of continuous power _ roughly equal to the entire electric output of a large commercial power station. The board called that `` an amount that is not only costly but may not be readily available in the time frame of the years 2000 to 2040'' when the accelerator would be working. It said a new power station, possibly a nuclear reactor, might have to be built just to provide electricity for the accelerator. In that case, the evironmental and safety advantages of an accelerator would be `` totally submerged,'' the panel said. `` It may be simpler, in fact, to use a nuclear reactor to produce tritium directly ... rather than have it, or a fossil plant, produce electricity to operate the accelerator,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
 Increasing winds Thursday blew more tumbleweeds into town, while the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> contemplated how to stop an invasion that buried homes and blocked streets. `` They're still coming,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` The wind is picking up. They've been baling this morning, but they're losing ground now.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said some streets that were blocked by tumbleweeds were cleared Thursday. Officials were worried about fires from the tinder-dry brush and traffic accidents, but <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said none had been reported. `` Most of the people slow down and let the thistle blow across the road before they drive through,'' he said. Two years of drought exposed the banks of the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Oahe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservoir </ORGANIZATION>, providing a perfect spot for the Russian thistle commonly known as tumbleweed to flourish. High winds Tuesday night launched the invasion; Thursday's forecast called for northwest winds gusting to 35 mph. Crews have been trying to bale the weeds already in town, but corps officials said Thursday they're not sure how to battle the brush left along the reservoir. One option is a controlled burn, but the extent of the weeds and the cool, windy weather could pose problems, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a natural resource specialist with the corps. Another is to chop the stringy weeds so they wo n't wrap around one another into mounds that grow, snowball-fashion, as they're tossed across the prairie He estimated that several hundred acres of weeds remain on the banks of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> said a combination of weather and geography led to the flurry of tumbleweeds, which buried some homes in the north-central <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> town of about 4,000 people. `` They grow all summer long, and at the first frost they die,'' he said. `` They break off right at ground level and get blown around by the wind.'' Other town need not worry he said, adding, `` <LOCATION> Mobridge </LOCATION> is fairly unique in that it sits right on the river.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> said the weeds first appeared in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the late 1800s in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. The scrubby tumbleweeds have a prairie charm that captivates the imaginations of tourists, he said. `` We get visitors to the lake all the time, and the two things they just freak at are prairie dogs and tumbleweeds,'' he said. `` Only in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> would you have a town taken over by tumbleweeds.''

<TEXT>
 Former Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Thursday that a planned bill to limit computer-driven stock trading does n't go far enough and suggested a ban on one form of the market strategy. He targeted index arbitrage, in which speculators try to take advantage of inconsistencies between the stock and futures markets by simultaneously buying in one while selling in the other. Critics claim index arbitrage widens price swings and drives small investors out of the market. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the telecommunications and finance subcommittee, plans to introduce legislation to restrict program trading during times of extreme market turbulence But <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, the former head of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposal `` is more of a partial solution to the problem and, if enacted, may not cure it.'' He told the subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the problem is stock index futures _ futures contracts tied to the performance of large groups of stocks. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> suggested doing away with the commodity aspects of index futures `` to lessen volatility'' or making `` the stock market derivatives have the same rules as stocks.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who now heads the <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Regdon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, told the panel, `` There are just a few traders who are selfishly rigging the market for their own benefit,'' said <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> before becoming <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary under then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, was part of a panel of investment company executives that called for restraining program trading. The witnesses split in their recommendations of what action <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should take. `` The problem we're addressing is volatility, not the program trading problem,'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said. Although his firm has halted index arbitrage for customer accounts, <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> noted: `` The public should recognize that any steps taken to curb program trading will not cure volatility.'' Program trading _ almost instantaneous transactions through computerized buy and sell programs _ has been a topic of dispute for years but the debate heated up after the Oct. 13 stock market slide. When the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped more than 190 points last month, many critics said the situation was worsened by program trading _ especially index arbitrage. The panel members agreed that market volatility scares investors out of the market, making it more difficult for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to raise capital through the sale of securities. Most of Wall Street's large investment houses recently have revised their policies on index arbitrage. And the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has called on large, institutional investors to curb program trading while ways to handle the bursts of stock orders it generates are considered. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>'s plan would grant emergency powers to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to temporarily halt program trading during extreme market turbulence.

 Three weeks after its launch from a shuttle, the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft fired its thrusters Thursday to begin the first of about 30 course changes needed for its roundabout six-year trip to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. `` We've started the first trajectory correction maneuver,'' mission director <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON> said after the three-day series of thruster ignitions got under way at 8:31 a.m. PST. During the maneuver, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> is firing four of its 12 thrusters in a series of pulses, he said. No individual pulse exceeds two minutes, each set of pulses takes about 45 minutes, and the entire maneuver will be completed Saturday night. Two other thrusters may be used to correct the spacecraft's rate of spin and the direction toward which it points, said <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The trajectory change is meant to aim <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> for its flight past <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> in February. The spacecraft, launched from space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18, will swoop by <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> once and <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> twice so the planets can act as `` gravity slingshots'' to propel <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> toward Jupiter during the $ 1.9 billion mission. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> was about 31 million miles into its looping 2.4 billion-mile journey to the solar system's largest planet, <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON> said. It was about 4.6 million miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and 58.5 million miles from <LOCATION> Venus </LOCATION>, traveling at 60,376 mph relative to the sun. In July 1995, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will separate into an orbiter and a probe. The orbiter will circle Jupiter for 22 months starting in December 1995, the same month the probe will parachute into the Jovian atmosphere, making measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed by intense pressure. About 30 course corrections involving thruster firings spread over 135 days will be required en route to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> has ignited its 3.5 inch-long thrusters on other occasions, but those firings were to adjust spin or direction, <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON> said. The three-day maneuver that started Thursday is <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>'s first trajectory correction, he added. <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON> said the West German-built thrusters have to fire in pulses to avoid contaminating sensitive parts of <LOCATION> Galileo </LOCATION>. The thrusters are attached to the spinning part of <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>, and can fire only when they are not above sensitive areas on the non-spinning section of the spacecraft. The thrusters also are fired in pulses because <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> fears continuous firing might make them overheat and burn through, a problem that developed on the same type of thrusters on two satellites in recent years, <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> was sworn in as <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s second civilian president Thursday and named a loyal follower to succeed him as premier in an apparent attempt to maintain control from his new, weaker post <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> named <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbulut </PERSON> just hours after he was inaugurated. Elected by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> assumed power from <PERSON> Kenan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evren </PERSON>, leader of the 1980 military coup, who completed a seven-year presidential term and by law could not run for re-election. The choice of <PERSON> Akbulut </PERSON> was dictated in part by fear that factional fighting could disintegrate the governing <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that has been held together by <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s leadership, political analysts said. <PERSON> Akbulut </PERSON> quickly announced a Cabinet almost identical to the previous one. Two state ministers were left out and seven new ones were added. The 450-member Parliament, where the <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> commands a majority of 283 seats, will have a vote of confidence on the new government sometime next week. The legislature will also elect a new speaker. Included in the Cabinet were just about anyone likely to mount a campaign for party leadership, which is to be decided in a convention Nov. 17. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, 62, was elected <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s eight president on a third ballot Oct. 31 with the votes of 263 Motherland deputies. Opposition Social Democrat and centrist True Path parties boycotted the inauguration ceremony just as they did the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> sessions for the election of the president. The opposition has maintained that <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, blamed for 75 percent inflation two years running and his popularity shrunken in the wake of charges of nepotism and corruption in government ranks, lacked a clear mandate necessary for the presidential post. They also claim he would transform the job with little executive power into an imperial presidency, running the <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from behind scenes, in violation of the constitution. In the presidential oath, accompanied by a 101-salvo cannon salute, <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> pledged to be free of bias. He said later, in an inauguration address, that he would be true to his oath `` at the cost of my life'' if necessary. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> first acquired political fame as deputy premier of the military government when he initiated the 1980 economic rescue program. He became premier in 1983 general elections restoring civilian rule and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> enjoyed export-led growth under his free-market economic policies. But high inflation, the price of the boom, has made economic planning difficult, the poor have become poorer and the middle class has shrunk. When he was elected president <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s public support was around 17 percent, according to public opinion polls. <PERSON> Akbulut </PERSON>, 52, served as interior minister in one of <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s Cabinets until he was elected parliament speaker following 1987 general elections The premier-designate is known as a moderate in the party which includes liberal, Moslem fundamentalist and ultra-nationalist factions. <PERSON> Akbulut </PERSON> raised the number of ministers to 30 from previous 25, adding five more state ministerships.

 Workers have dredged a 14-mile river to open <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s largest port to major commercial traffic from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> for the first time since the war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> began in 1980, an official said Thursday. Millions of tons of silt were removed from the <LOCATION> Shatt-Al-Basra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to make it navigable for medium and small-size vessels from the southern port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> to the gulf, said <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Ajmi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadum </PERSON>, director-general of the government-run al-Muthana Irrigation Co. He said cargo ships with hulls up to 33 feet deep will be able to navigate the waterway beginning Nov. 15, opening up the war-battered south to expanded trade under <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s postwar reconstruction drive. The waterway, which connects with the 30-mile-long <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Zubair </PERSON> <PERSON> River </PERSON> that leads to the gulf, is an alternative to the disputed and still-blocked Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main outlet to the gulf before the war. It is also about half the distance. The $ 12 million project was launched in October 1988 in a drive to reopen <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> to commercial shipping, two months after the cease-fire in the 8-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The port was shutdown when the war began in September 1980. <PERSON> Kadum </PERSON> said millions of tons of silt have been dredged from the channel between <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Maqal </LOCATION> port and <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Zubair </PERSON> to the south. There the waterway links with the <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Zubair </PERSON> river that runs into the northern waters of the gulf through Umm Qasr, near the Kuwaiti border. <PERSON> Kadum </PERSON> said the Shatt-Al-Basra was widened to 315 feet and its depth increased by 19 -LCB- feet. It is fed by the <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s southern marshes. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has demanded the Iranians allow the Shatt-Al-Arab, the southern boundary between the two countries, to be reopened under a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has refused to do so until <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agrees to abide by a 1975 treaty that draws the border down the middle of the waterway, which is still blocked by war debris. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says it abrogated the treaty a few days before war broke out and insists that the border runs down the eastern, Iranian shore.

<HEAD>Iran Says U.S. Release of Some Frozen Assets Not Sign of Good Will</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior Iranian official said Thursday that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s decision to release $ 567 million in frozen Iranian assets was not a sign of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> good will. Since the repayment was ordered by a claims tribunal, `` it has nothing to do with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration's good will,'' <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaezi </PERSON>, deputy foreign minister for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> affairs, said in Iranian news reports monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has linked any effort to help free 18 Westerners held hostage by Islamic groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> releasing Iranian assets frozen since 1979. The assets which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Monday that it would release are only a small portion of what <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he hoped the action will prompt <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to obtain freedom for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages, though administration officials said the decision to transfer the money was unrelated to the hostage issue. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says the assets frozen a decade ago are up to $ 12 billion, including the value of weapons purchased before the 1979 Islamic revolution but never delivered. The assets were frozen after militants stormed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Nov. 4, 1979, and held American diplomats and other personnel hostage. Fifty-two captives were released 444 days later. Earlier Thursday, in the first public reaction to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision, the <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said in an editorial that the release was insufficient. The newspaper, which is close to Iranian President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, did not elaborate on the `` goodwill'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is seeking before mediating a release of the hostages held by Shiite Moslem zealots. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, leader of the so-called pragmatists in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, told a news conference last month that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would help secure the release of the captives, including eight Americans, if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> unblocks Iranian assets. The money was held in a fund to guarantee American bank claims against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Most of those claims were settled in the past few weeks, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. In addition to the Americans, the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are four Britons, two Swiss, two West Germans, an Irishman and an Italian.

 Investigators on Thursday recovered $ 17 million in artworks stolen from <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s granddaughter, finding them at the home of a restaurateur, who was then arrested, police said. Two other men _ both security guards at <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Picasso </LOCATION>'s villa in <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> _ also have been arrested in the theft of the 13 works on Sunday, police said. The restaurateur, <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> Laugier </PERSON>, 47, was arrested in nearby <LOCATION> Le </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradet </LOCATION> and charged with fencing stolen goods. The security guards, <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouzeau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaguin </PERSON>, were charged with serious theft. All three men remained jailed Thursday night. <PERSON> Clouzeau </PERSON> was on vacation when the theft took place Sunday morning and <PERSON> Jaguin </PERSON> had gone shopping for a loaf of bread, leaving the villa unguarded for 40 minutes. Ms. <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> was not home. Police identified the missing works only as seven paintings by <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Breughel </LOCATION>, an <PERSON> Odilon </PERSON> <PERSON> Redon </PERSON>, three lesser-known 19th century works and a bust by sculptor <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodin </PERSON>. The works have an estimated value of $ 17 million. All were recovered Thursday and transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Nice </ORGANIZATION>, where the investigation continues, police said. Ms. <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> was spending the weekend in the Alpine town of <LOCATION> Megeve </LOCATION> when the theft occurred at her 1900s-style Pavillon de Flore in the <PERSON> Basse </PERSON> <PERSON> Californie </PERSON> section of <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> has made no public comment since returning to <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> on Monday. She is the daughter of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, the painter's son, and his first wife, <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Kokhlova </PERSON>. Investigators with the Nice police said early in the case that all signs pointed to someone with intimate knowledge of the property. There were almost no signs of a break-in, the sophisticated burglar alarm did not function, and none of the five guard dogs raised a fuss. Three current and former employees at the villa, including <PERSON> Jaguin </PERSON>'s girlfriend, were questioned Tuesday and released.

<HEAD>Quake Creates A Different Kind Of Disaster Victim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES O. CLIFFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The earthquake that tore through <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has been a postgraduate school for veteran <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who says the disaster has produced a `` different kind of clientele.'' `` This has been a real learning experience for me,'' said <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who runs an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base shelter that opened after the Oct. 17 earthquake. Shelters normally are designed to close quickly, said <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 64, a volunteer from <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, who has worked on 24 disasters. `` We figure a shelter will be closed in four days,'' he said in his office at the Presidio while children played on the barracks porch. More than three weeks have passed since the 7.1-magnitude quake struck, killing 66 people and causing an estimated $ 7 billion damage. In other disasters, said <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, the victims belonged to `` families where their houses were destroyed. They received temporary shelter and then were gone. Here, it's also people who lived in hotels, apartments, maybe on the streets. Some keep coming back.'' Red Cross officials estimated about 6,000 people needed help after the quake. There are about 300 people now at the three shelters on the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base and fewer than 200 in a downtown shelter. While Green talked, a woman wearing a robe walked down the hall, apparently after washing her hair. Outside, a man, his wife and another woman watched children playing. The scene was almost pastoral compared to the more tense atmosphere in the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelter in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where single men are housed and were shouting matches and even brawls are not unknown. `` We only have men here,'' shelter manager <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said. `` The bed count is now 125, down from a top of 300. Some of the people we helped have gotten jobs and everyone staying in the shelter has been verified as a quake victim.'' No questions were asked in the immediate aftermath of the quake, said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>. `` We just helped anyone one who needed it,'' said Page. `` A few days ago, we started to limit shelter to those who could prove they lived in a residence before the quake. Then again, your home before the quake could have been a park bench.'' As if to underscore the new limit on who may live there, a man who had recently been told to leave yelled at Page as Page walked to his car, telling him it would be `` smart'' to check under the hood for explosives. Other men outside ticked off a list of complaints, ranging from the food to the lack of showers. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, 37, has lived in the shelter since Oct. 25 when he returned from a trip to find his Marina apartment destroyed. `` I lost everything, even my car,'' said <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, taking notes for a book on the earthquake. <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said some of the men's gripes were legitimate. `` We had just cold cereal for breakfast this morning. Last night it was chicken patties. We get lots of potatoes _ even had them three times a day once.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> had a homeless problem before the quake and officials have warned that unless low-income housing wrecked in the disaster is replaced, the situation will only get worse. An estimated 80 percent of the housing left uninhabitable was marked for the poor. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, deputy mayor for housing, said 1,170 housing units were declared unsafe and 3,000 more were found to need repairs. Worse still, city spokesman <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said the earthquake destroyed `` a good part of the city's homeless program.'' The program paid for a night's lodging for transients at certain hotels. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> figured the quake demolished 25 percent of those hotel rooms. It is n't as if <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has n't gone through this before. The massive quake in April 1906 left far more homeless. By winter, some 25,000 people still lived in tents around the city. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> eventually designed wooden `` earthquake shacks.'' Why not again? For one thing, a lot in 1906 cost only $ 250. `` The opportunities for finding cheap land are much reduced from those days, when many parts of the city were totally undeveloped,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader, passed his last formal leadership post to his chosen successor Thursday and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> laid out an austere economic plan for the next two years. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 85, resigned as chairman of the party's powerful <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in favor of party chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>. He still heads the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a virtual mirror of the party group, but said in a letter released Thursday he also would leave that job. The move solidifies <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s position and appears at least to suspend a reported power struggle between him and President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, 63, had not held a national post until his elevation to party leader after the pro-democracy movement was crushed in June. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not surprised by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s move and added, `` I suspect he will remain an influence.'' `` You could say that the change would n't have occurred if there was n't a certain element of stability there,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> commented. Foreign diplomats and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources agree <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is likely to remain the leading voice in party and government affairs, as he has been since leaving the Politburo and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, an 82-year-old former general with strong army connections, was named vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which sets military policy. He is reported to have sought the chairmanship to consolidate his power base. In another concession to <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, a mastermind of the June military crackdown, his younger brother <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Baibing </PERSON>, an army political commissar, was appointed secretary-general of the commission. Although <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> described <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> party boss with a weak power base in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, as the `` nucleus'' of the new leadership, many feel the party leader's political fortunes are tied to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s physical health. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, quoted <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s resignation letter, dated Wednesday, as saying: `` As early as 1980, I proposed reforming the leadership system of the party and state and abolishing the life-long tenure of leading posts. `` I have insisted on not taking up day-to-day affairs and have been looking forward to completing the succession of the older generation by the younger generation as soon as possible and realizing my aspiration of completely retiring from the leading posts.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> praised <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> as the `` chief architect in all aspects of the party's and army's works.'' A lengthy communique said he was `` an outstanding Marxist, a staunch communist, a brilliant proletarian revolutionary statesman and military strategist and a long-tested leader of the party and state.'' It said economic reforms <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> began a decade ago would continue, but for at least two years the people must `` lead a thrifty life'' to fight inflation of nearly 20 percent annually, too-rapid growth and corruption. The party outlined goals of lower consumption, tighter financial control, realigned industrial structure and increased production. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s letter, in turn, lauded <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, who became head of the 48 million-member party after <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> was dismissed in June. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s former protege, was accused of being too close to the pro-democracy movement. Of the party leadership, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said it had created `` a leading nucleus headed by Comrade <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> and it is now already carrying out its work effectively.'' Although it is possible <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> has been shunted aside, his strong military ties are important because the army's power was enhanced by the brutal June crackdown in which hundreds of people were killed. In addition to having his brother beside him as the military commission's secretary-general, he has an ally in the army chief of staff, <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Haotian </PERSON>, said to be his son-in-law. During the student-led protests that began in April, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> were the party military commission's chairman and junior vice chairman, respectively. They prevailed over <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, the first vice chairman, in having martial law declared and ultimately sending in troops. Such a graphic illustration of how leaders could summon the army to support their policies gave the commission new eminence in the party power structure. In the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> on Thursday, an official said six people had been executed for participating in riots in June. The executions brought to at least 18 the number of people put to death in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after the pro-democracy movement was crushed. At <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which was a center of protest, students with party membership were summoned to a meeting Thursday and ordered to tell classmates not to use <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s resignation as an excuse for `` rash'' action, a student said. No incidents were reported on campus. `` We admire <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, but it's good that he's stepping down, since he's so old,'' said a student who was active in the protests. `` He's a skillful statesman. We do n't hate him, because he wants reform in his heart, even though he took such harsh measures back in June.'' He said of <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>: `` We do n't dislike him. He's more like the lesser of two evils.''

<HEAD>Afghan Rebels: Kabul Release of List of Slain Prisoners a Ploy</HEAD>

 Afghan guerrillas on Thursday said the Afghan government resurrected a 9-year-old list of executed political prisoners as a ploy to distance themselves from their Marxist predecessors. Lord <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethell </PERSON>, a British member of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, turned over a copy of the list to officials of the insurgents' Afghan government-in-exile in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bethell </PERSON> said Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> gave him the list containing thousands of names on a visit to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> last week where he secured the release of three rebel prisoners. An Afghan rebel spokesman in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafrey </PERSON>, said the list was first published in 1980. `` I'm not sure what the purpose of this is, except to try to distance themselves from the past,'' he said. It contained names of thousands of people secret police executed in the 20 months after the April 1978 coup that brought Communists to power. It included two former prime ministers, <PERSON> Noor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Etimadi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafiq </PERSON>. Soviet troops intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. They installed a new leader, then remained to help fight a growing anti-communist insurgency before withdrawing this year. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s first Communist leaders were <PERSON> Nur </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hafizullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> of the Khalq faction of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Both eventually were assassinated. The Soviets replaced <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> in 1979 with rival <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON> of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Parcham </ORGANIZATION> wing. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, of the same faction, became head of secret police for the next five years. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> was installed as party chief in 1986 after <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON> stepped down for health reasons. When <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON> issued the list of secret police victims in February 1980, it was seen as an attempt to discredit <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON>'s predecessors. It is still available in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> bookshops. Lefrey charged the list was being resurrected to further distance <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> from his party's Communist revolutionary roots. The <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government in recent years has attempted to shed its Marxist taint in favor of <LOCATION> Islam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s dominant religion, in an effort to broaden its support. But the guerrillas have fought bitterly to topple it and establish an all-Moslem government. <PERSON> Bethell </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that said some <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> lawmakers `` mentioned there had been a list of 11,000 in the early years of the revolution'' but he did not know whether his was a carbon copy of the earlier one. `` While <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> was head of <LOCATION> Khad </LOCATION> he did much worse than what was on that list,'' Lefrey charged. `` Some think the number of people who have been executed is 70,000 to 80,000 in the past 10 years.''

<HEAD>Advocates: Seafood Should Be Inspected Like Beef, Poultry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The absence of federal seafood inspection puts <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishermen at a competitive disadvantage and leaves consumers unsure about the quality of fish, witnesses told a congressional hearing Thursday. House Democrats representing coastal districts are pushing the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to back a plan for federally funded inspections to provide consumers the same quality assurances available for chicken and beef. Administration officials told the <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> and the Environment that they have reached no decision on the issue. `` The administration has not come to the conclusion that it is not needed right now,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. But he added, `` The administration has not come down on a position on what it wants to do.'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s comment drew a sharp rebuke from the subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., who said, `` I do n't think we've had a matter of consequence before this committee on which the administration has had a position. The cost of a federally funded seafood inspection program could range from $ 50 million to $ 80 million, according to <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Currently the seafood industry pays about $ 6 million _ as much as $ 100,000 per year for an individual company _ for seafood inspections. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said one reason for the administration's reluctance to provide financing is that seafood inspection is a direct benefit to the industry because it promotes consumer confidence. `` In essence we're talking about how to promote the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry and whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry should pay for it,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> said that the beef and poultry industries benefit from government-financed inspections while fishmermen must pay for their own. Over eight years, the subcommittee said, consumption of commercial seafood rose by 20 percent a year to a record high in 1987 of 15.4 pounds per capita.

<HEAD>Corn Crop Way Up, USDA Reports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers are completing a corn harvest estimated at a three-year high of 7.59 billion bushels, up 54 percent from last year's drought-reduced crop and up 2 percent from the forecast a month ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Drought reduced the 1988 corn crop to 4.92 billion bushels. In October, the department estimated this year's production at 7.45 billion bushels, a 51 percent increase from last year. At 7.59 billion bushels the harvest would be the largest since 8.25 billion bushels in 1986. The record was the 1985 crop of nearly 8.9 billion bushels. `` Harvest progressed rapidly in the 17 major producing states during October and was 88 percent complete by Nov. 5, compared with 91 percent last year and the average of 78 percent,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Corn yields were estimated at 116.6 bushels per acre harvested, up from 114.4 forecast in October and 84.6 bushels in 1988 but still below the record of 119.4 bushels per acre in 1987. As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm crop. It is essential for the production of meat, poultry and dairy products. Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 4.1 percent in 1988, are expected to go up about 6 percent this year, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has not issued its 1990 forecast, but some analysts tentatively indicate food prices wo n't match this year's rise, the steepest since a 7.8 percent jump in 1981. Soybean production, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable oil, was estimated at 1.94 billion bushels, up 25 percent from last year's harvest of 1.54 billion bushels and 1 percent above the October estimate of 1.93 billion bushels. The record soybean output was 2.26 billion bushels in 1979. Yields were estimated at an average of 32.8 bushels per acre this year, compared with 26.9 bushels in 1988, the October forecast of 32.6 bushels and a record 34.1 bushels per acre in 1985. The department's all-crops production index was reported at 104 percent of its 1977 average used for comparison. Last year, reflecting the severe drought, the index plummeted to 89 percent. The record reading was 117 percent set in 1981, 1982 and 1985. Cotton production was indicated at 12.1 million bales, down 21 percent from last year's output and 2 percent below the September estimate of 12.3 million bales. The new estimate was up about 1 percent from October. The cotton record was 18.9 million bales in 1937. No new estimates of 1989 production of wheat and other crops harvested earlier were included in the report. In a related report on supply and demand for major commodities, analysts said total corn use in the 1989-90 marketing year that began on Sept. 1 is expected to be about 7.625 billion bushels, including domestic and export requirements, an increase from 7.5 billion forecast in October. With demand exceeding 1989 corn production, that will mean a further drawdown of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpiles to about 1.9 billion bushels left over by next Sept. 1, down from inventories estimated at 1.93 billion bushels at the beginning of the marketing year. Still, that represents only a slight dip in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn stockpile, compared to last season's decline, when it plummeted from 4.26 billion bushels on Sept. 1, 1988, to the 1.93 billion bushels on hand this Sept. 1. Analysts said total corn use in the coming year will be boosted by larger exports than had been anticipated, about 2.15 billion bushels instead of the 2 billion that was forecast last month. Larger imports by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are expected to account for a much of the increase. The report said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn prices may average in the range of $ 2 to $ 2.40 per bushel in the 1989-90 marketing year, down from $ 2.54 last season. The October forecast was $ 1.85 to $ 2.25 per bushel. Other 1989 crop estimates based on Oct. 1 indications, compared with 1988 output, included: _ Sorghum, 628.9 million bushels and an average yield of 59.8 bushels per acre, compared with 577.6 million and 63.8 in 1988 _ Rice, 156.4 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,697 pounds per acre, compared with 159.5 million and 5,511 _ Peanuts, 4.13 billion pounds and a yield of 2,523 pounds per acre, compared with 3.98 billion and 2,445 _ Potatoes, total, 367.3 million hundredweight and a yield of 292 hundredweight per acre, compared with 356.4 million and 283 _ Tobacco, 1.47 billion pounds and a yield of 2,105 pounds per acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,160 _ Sugarbeets, 26 million tons and a yield of 19.6 tons per acre, compared with 24.8 million and 19.1 _ Sugarcane, 30.4 million tons and a yield of 35.2 tons per acre, compared with 29.9 million and 35.4

<HEAD>Security Tightened to Curb Crime Before Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The military government on Thursday stepped up security to curb a wave of crime that opposition leaders say is a serious threat to next month's elections and the country's transition to democratic rule Police patrols were reinforced in this capital of 5 million people, especially in areas where banks and shops are concentrated. Police carrying submachine guns and wearing bulletproof vests were seen in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s center. Police said all vacations and days off were temporarily suspended in the 29,000-member force. The government's reaction came after a series of often violent robberies of banks, supermarkets, shops and private residences, and several incidents of violence related to the current campaign for the presidential and congressional elections scheduled for Dec. 14. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, the opposition presidential candidate, highly favored by most polls to win, suggested radical pro-government groups may be behind the crime wave. `` An atmosphere of violence and unrest only serves those who know are going to lose'' the election, <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said in southern <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, where he is campaigning. The election will mark the restoration of civilian rule in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, which has been ruled by an authoritarian military regime since the 1973 coup led by right-wing President Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. Police records show violent incidents have occurred almost daily for five weeks. On Wednesday, two armed men wearing ski masks entered the home of <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, a leading opposition politician, severely beat his wife and fled. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s son-in-law, said the men first demanded money and jewels but then fled with only a box containing family documents and souvenirs. <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> said `` the men did not look like common criminals.'' Earlier this month, similar incidents occurred at the homes of two well-known television journalists. In the most serious political incident, <PERSON> Jecar </PERSON> <PERSON> Neghme </PERSON>, leader of a radical leftist group, was assasinated Sept. 30. No arrests have been reported. After the incident at <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s residence opposition leaders said the series of violent crimes may be part of an effort to interfere in the election campaign. The coalition of 17 parties supporting <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said in a statement: `` These criminal actions constitute a suspicious pattern of provocations and an apparently well-planned effort to scare and alarm citizens.'' <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Astorga </PERSON>, Vice President of <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, claimed his party has information that members of the government's secret police `` are operating in this situations.'' He did not elaborate. Former Finance Minister <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, the pro-government presidential candidate, said the incident at <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s home `` is more than just a common crime. It can be interpreted as an attack on the process of democratic restoration.'' He said `` the government has the obligation'' of investigating and arresting the attackers. The government said it will `` ensure the country's tranquility and security and will maintain public order'' during the campaign and until the inauguration of the new government next March 11. Col. <PERSON> Cristian </PERSON> <PERSON> Labbe </PERSON>, the government's Secretary General, accused the opposition of trying to `` make political gains from a situation that worries the entire country.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was obliged to call the election after last year's referendum in which voters rejected a military proposal to extend his rule until 1997

<HEAD>Aerosol Deodorants Will Be Illegal After 1995 Unless Safe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Aerosol deodorants will be banned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> within six years, unless their makers can find alternatives to harmful air pollutants emitted by the spray cans, a state regulatory agency ruled. The decision Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was its first step in adopting a plan to reduce pollution from a variety of consumer aerosol products. The board ordered an 80 percent cut in hydrocarbons found in spray cans by Jan. 1, 1995. `` This landmark action requires manufacturers to use more environmentally acceptable substitutes if they choose to continue selling aerosols and will likely set a precedent for other consumer product actions that follow,'' board Chairwoman <PERSON> Jananne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpless </PERSON> said in a statement. Hydrocarbons, one of many sources of smog and other pollution that scientists say harm human lungs, are used as a propellant in many spray products. Only a very few hydrocarbons are known to harm the Earth's ozone They became popular after 1978 when chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, were banned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of their danger to the ozone layer. Representatives of the aerosol industry attacked the decision, saying it would force them to withdraw some products from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> market. Other new regulations under consideration for household products and for fuels and industrial processes include a proposed regulation to control smoke from wood stoves in homes. Aerosol products, from hair spray to pesticides, will come under board scrutiny in coming months, <PERSON> Sharpless </PERSON> said. Wednesday's decision applied to deodorants The agency is not attempting to `` pass a judgment on any particular type of product'' or put manufacturers out of business, she said. <PERSON> Sharpless </PERSON> called higher prices that could result from the regulation the price consumers must pay for a safe environment. The board heard from a number of industry representatives who said the deadlines were unrealistic and that some companies may have to take their products out of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> market. The board, nonetheless, voted 6-2 to adopt the deodorant-antiperspirant regulation. The dissenters, Dr. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Boston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fullerton </LOCATION> and Mayor <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughan </PERSON> of <PERSON> Gilroy </PERSON>, said they were voting `` no'' because they wanted a tougher regulation. The 1995 ban is part of a complex regulation that would allow exceptions for manufacturers to keep some polluting aerosol products on the market until 1999.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will consider giving itself a pay raise even if it fails to resolve the budget crisis that has the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> threatening tens of thousands of layoffs. But other lawmakers said passing the pay raise and ethics reform package is already a politically dicey proposition and could fail unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> first puts the government's fiscal affairs in better order. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., has been meeting with leaders of both parties in an effort to push through a pay raise this year as part of a package that also would tighten congressional ethics regulations, including clamping down on accepting fees for speeches to interest groups <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders have been working with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to craft a package acceptable to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Last week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> indicated the president's willingness to look at such a proposal but the president himself was silent. `` I think when the time comes ... the president will be forthcoming in his support,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are paid $ 89,500 a year. A plan to boost salaries by 51 percent was killed earlier this year after a storm of public protest. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership has been briefing members this week on their new plan, which includes a pay raise of about 8 percent to go into effect January 1 and another 25 percent boost a year later. The raise would apply to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, federal judges, and top executive branch officials. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he thought the package could be brought before the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as early as next week. He said it would move forward even if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has failed to address government-wide spending cuts ordered last month because lawmakers have failed to reduce the federal deficit. `` That is a separate matter ... I do n't think we are likely to see any direct connection between the two,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. Those cutbacks, required by the Gramm-Rudman law, cut many domestic and military programs. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials testified this week that the 2.1 million active duty armed forces would have to be reduced by about 229,000 in the next year. The Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president are currently in negotiations over a deficit-reduction bill which would cancel those cutbacks. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Wash., said he hoped to produce a bill by the end of next week If that effort fails, he said he thought passage of a pay increase was unlikely. `` Whether people like it or not, the two issues are tied very closely together,'' he said. What could become untied in the future is the salary of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>., and Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said this week the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would accept, perhaps without even a vote, a `` cost-of-living'' adjustment _ which is what the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders are calling the 8 percent raise next Senators generally are wealthier than <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, and their rules allow them to keep more speaking fees than their colleagues across the Capitol. `` There's not a lot of support in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for a pay raise,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. If the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a pay raise for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and not the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, `` It would be odd,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, who said he supports raising <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> salaries and eliminating the acceptance of honoraria. But it would not be unprecedented. From Dec. 21, 1982 through July 1, 1983, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members were paid $ 69,800 and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> $ 60,662.

 Mayor <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> who headed the city's government for 26 of the last 30 years, died Thursday after a long struggle with cancer. He was 71. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> died at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, where he was admitted Sept. 12. The popular mayor was known as `` Honest Art'' and `` Mr. Clean'' for his scandal-free administrations. His open-door government often involved personal meetings with residents, and he developed a national reputation as an advocate for urban America. Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> ordered flags on state buildings lowered to half-staff. City Council President <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Armenti </PERSON>, who unseated <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> in 1966 and was in turn defeated by him in 1970, became acting mayor. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, who had had several bouts with cancer, revealed in June that he had inoperable lymphatic cancer. That same month, he completed a one-year term as president of the mayors' group. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said he would not run for re-election as mayor, but promised to continue working as much as possible. He kept a full schedule until his hospitalization. Born in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> spent six years at a seminary, but did not enter the priesthood. He began his city government career in 1951 as deputy director of public affairs. He was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in 1955 and won his first mayoral election in 1959. To demonstrate the sincerity of his commitment to civil rights, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> in 1964 moved his family into a run-down, racially mixed neighborhood. Possibly hurt by the move, <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> suffered his only mayoral defeat in 1966 in the loss to Armenti.

<HEAD>Administration Opposes Work Cards for Citizens, Aliens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official testified Thursday against a proposal that the government issue `` work authorization cards'' on request both to citizens and to aliens eligible to work in this country. Such cards would be used largely by immigrants, distinguishing those who are in this country legally from those who are here illicitly. `` This could lead to discrimination against those individuals who do not have the card,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Virtue </PERSON>, acting general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. He added that such a card might be viewed as a national identity card, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has forbidden. Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., who sponsored the proposal for a work authorization card, said that Social Security cards are used much like identity cards <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said the card he proposed would help prevent fraud and discourage employers from discriminating against various groups. They spoke at a hearing of the subcommittee on Immigration, which <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> chairs. The subcommittee is part of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition to <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s idea also came from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative agency of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Harvest Above Expectations, but Imports Still Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 1989 grain harvest turned out larger than predicted but that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> still must import huge amounts of grain in the year ahead. Currently, the department expects the Soviet harvest to total 208 million metric tons, an increase of three million tons from the previous forecast. That would compare with 195.1 million tons in 1988 and would be the fifth largest Soviet harvest on record, exceeded by 237.4 million tons in 1978, 223.8 million in 1976, 211.4 million in 1987, and 210.1 million in 1986. Production of rye, barley, oats, corn, sorghum and millet _ so-called coarse grain _ was indicated at 105.5 million tons, up 2.5 million from the previous forecast in October. Wheat output was unchanged at 89 million tons, but miscellaneous grain was increased by 500,000 tons to 13.5 million. Total grain imports by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the 1989-90 trade year, which began July 1, were estimated at 37 million tons, up three million from earlier. That would still be short of the 39 million tons imported in 1987-88 and the record 55.5 million in 1984-85. No specific breakdown showing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shares of the Soviet trade was included, but the report noted that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was recently cleared to buy 16 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain in 1989-90 under a long-term agreement. However, the agreement year began on Oct. 1, so the comparisons are not exact. In 1988-89, the Soviets bought a record of 21.7 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and corn, and so far this year have purchased 8.1 million tons for 1989-90 delivery.

 A congresswoman Thursday questioned the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to make the skipper of the USS Iowa eligible for another major command in light of inquiries into the battleship blast that killed 47 sailors Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said she was asking <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to explain the `` alleged selection'' of Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> for sequential major command. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation concluded that gunner's mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> `` most likely'' caused the April 19 explosion by inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inch guns. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s family and shipmates have criticized the report. Oakar has asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to review the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s findings The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> screening board that took the action on <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> includes Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, who headed the service's investigation into the explosion, <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON> said `` I realize that consideration and possible selection of Capt. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> does not commit the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to consider him for sequential major command, but I question the propriety of such action while there are several congressional and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigations ongoing,'' Oakar said. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON> said, received a non-punitive `` letter of admonition'' Oct. 3 after an administrative hearing on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> explosion. A sequential major command for a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer would be a move from commanding a cruiser or battleship to another similar command, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` The selection or non-selection of an individual is predicated on his or her past performance and an individual's entire career and his or her performance during that entire career is considered,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> at the Pentagon. `` If someone is selected, that means they are just eligible,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said.

 A senator delayed action Thursday on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice to be ambassador to <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, saying the nominee's only qualification was that she made large contributions to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` I'm out to put an end to this ... ambassadorial spoils system,'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md., told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> about the nomination of <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> `` There are no qualifications for this lady,'' <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said. `` There's nothing there. There's no ` there' there.'' Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, defended the nomination, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made it because of his friendship with Mrs. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> not because she was a large <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contributor. <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, exercising his rights under the rules of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, blocked committee action for at least a week. But some Republicans said they feared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> might be prevented from acting at all because the current session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is nearing an end. <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, and her husband, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON>, gave about $ 300,000 to the national <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and 1988. That figure, he said, did n't include other large contributions to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> Ply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, made other large contributions to Republican causes, many of which have not been identified, <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Silvermans </ORGANIZATION> also arranged a $ 100,000 corporate loan in December 1988 to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural committee about the same time Mrs. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> was making clear her interest in an ambassadorship, <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said. The interest-free loan, which had been solicited with about 200 others for `` seed money'' to plan and arrange inaugural events, was repaid a month later, <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said. The Silvermans are members of Team 100, people who have contributed $ 100,000 or more to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said the many prominent figures who wrote letters urging that Mrs. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> be named an ambassador cited no other qualifications than her abilities as a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser. In her submission to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said she was qualified for the post because she had `` assisted my husband by planning and hosting corporate functions.'' <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> has opposed several of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominees on grounds they had no apparent qualifications except their large political contributions. He said there are 41 women in the senior service of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, all highly qualified and experienced. None has been named by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as an ambassador.

<DATELINE>ONGWEDIVA, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One woman crawled to the polls. Some people waded across rivers. Others camped overnight at polling stations as Namibians displayed a fierce determination to vote in their first open elections. Namibians have peacefully endured hours of searing heat, wind and dust in milelong lines to vote for an assembly that will write a constitution paving the way for independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Perhaps I can, hopefully, in the end of this exercise, say that this has been the most democratic elections in the world,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special representative <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> said Thursday after touring polling booths in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is supervising the independence process in the territory, which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled for 74 years. No date for independence has been set, but independence is expected to be early next year. By Thursday, the third day of 5-day elections, more than 60 percent of the 701,483 registered voters had cast ballots, according to <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> and territorial officials. <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> flew to the northern <LOCATION> Ovambo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s most populous area, and was told that 75 percent of those registered in the region already had voted. `` I think it indicates how dedicated the Namibians are, how anxious they have been to use their democratic right in this election,'' he remarked. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s South African administrator, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, predicted Wednesday the voter turnout would be nearly 100 percent by the time polls closed Saturday. Lines were much shorter Thursday, but the queues snaking along sandy village and township roads during the previous two days showed the variety of peoples who populate the territory. Diminutive Bushmen, clay-covered <PERSON> Himba </PERSON> women with animal-skin aprons, tall Herero women in Victorian-style dresses, and city dwellers in T-shirts declaring `` My vote is my secret'' _ all stood in line, quietly, patiently and with good humor. No reports of serious political violence and few instances of intimidation emerged. Election code violations have occurred, such as anonymous smear pamphlets aimed at discrediting the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the election favorite. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said before voting began that the organization would accept any outcome certified by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The key election issue is whether <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> will win two-thirds of the vote necessary to write a constitution without consulting the other nine parties. Polling stations in the northern region have no electricity or phones. Some were set up by teams flown in by helicopter. Water trucks and candles were brought in. Near <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION>, a lame woman who had come without friends crawled toward the polling booth Wednesday. In another Ovambo village a crippled man pushed himself along with his hands. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official in the northeastern town of <LOCATION> Rundu </LOCATION> said voters crossed the <LOCATION> Okavango </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in small canoes or waded across it. People who live in neighboring countries can vote if they or their parents were born in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> or if they resided in the territory for four years. U.N. Regional Director <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kavango </LOCATION> people, most of whom have n't voted in a century of colonial rule, began arriving at the <LOCATION> Rundu </LOCATION> polling station more than eight hours before it opened. `` They were just excited. They wanted to be the first,'' she said. `` They've been waiting a long time for this to happen.''

 East Berliners reacted with astonishment to the announcement Thursday that their Communist government was allowing them to travel freely to the West for the first time in decades. `` Is it really true?'' asked <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>. `` Show me the ADN report,'' the 18-year-old demanded, seizing a copy of the news as reported by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s official news agency. `` Why do n't they just tear the wall down right away?'' said student <PERSON> Birgit </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosspetzsch </PERSON>, 18, referring to the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall built in 1961 by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to keep its citizens from going West. Late Thursday, about 100 East Germans gathered at the <LOCATION> Brandenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>, the huge monument just over the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> in </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` Open the gate! Open the gate!'' they chanted. Two sisters whose last trip West was to the funeral of their grandmother in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in 1966 were so happy that tears of joy brimmed in their eyes. `` We're going to the friends in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> as soon as we can,'' said the older sister, aged 56. `` Really great,'' added her 44-year-old sister. West German police said about 100 East Germans had already crossed through <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall crossing points, while other East Germans apparently waited for police offices that issue visas to open in the morning. The government announcement came after the offices closed. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo, announced that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s heavily fortified frontier with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would be opened as a provisional step until a law is passed to allow greater freedom of travel. The decision means all East Germans `` can travel over all East German border checkpoints,'' including through the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> did not say when the law would be passed. Several young people thought the news would help to stem the mass exodus to the West. More than 200,000 have fled for the West so far this year, including 50,000 who have escaped through <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> since Saturday. `` I think that even some of those who left recently will come back now,'' said a 25-year-old electrician who gave his name only as <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. He had just heard the news from his mother, who made immediate plans to visit his brother, one of the tens of thousands of people who have fled <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in recent weeks through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` I'll be off to visit my brother in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>,'' he beamed. `` But I'll come back. I think many people will think about that now, where so much is changing here.'' Another mother, <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinze </PERSON>, made immediate plans to take underwear to her 19-year-old son, who fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> last week. She was carrying the garments in a plastic bag, ready to mail off, when she heard the news. `` Now I'm going to visit as soon as I can,'' she said, her voice shaking. `` I'm so happy.'' <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Landgraf </PERSON>, 28, made plans for a trip to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` Now I no longer feel locked in here.'' <PERSON> Sabine </PERSON>, a 22-year-old secretary, also named <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> as her first destination. `` Now I can get to know countries that we only ever saw on maps or heard about at school,'' she said. Several of those hearing the news at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Schoenhauser Allee metro station said they believed West Germans also would be happy. `` They ca n't cope any more,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. West German officials have said their reception centers are overflowing with the East Germans who have come West just since their Communist government allowed them out through <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> last Friday. Although relaxing travel restrictions would satisfy one of the central demands of dissatisfied East Germans, others remain. Demonstrators have demanded free elections and the end of the Communists 40-year monopoly on power. `` One party, that's a dictatorship, and nothing will change,'' said an 80-year-old widow. `` We need a multiparty government.'' `` We've got to get the right people in there _ then we can start talking,'' said <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Karek </PERSON>, 50, a newspaper vendor and part-time musician. Communist leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> on Thursday urged a new law ensuring free and democratic elections. But he did not say whether he was urging a true multiparty system. Despite the jubilation over the prospect of free travel, East Berliners remain skeptical of promised reforms, having heard too many promises from the Communists before to believe in fundamental change now. `` The changes are not yet really what we want,'' said a canteen worker in his 50s. `` We need completely new people _ we've seen where it led with the old lot.'' `` You can forget him,'' a 70-year-old retired trade worker said of <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>. `` Just a puppet like all the rest of them. For the moment, he's the only man possible, but he wo n't last.''

 Three scientists, including former space shuttle astronaut <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ride </PERSON>, on Thursday challenged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration argument that nuclear-tipped sea-launched cruise missiles can not be detected on vessels. In an article in Science Magazine, the scientists endorsed a Soviet argument that a total ban on those missiles could be verified under a proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -LRB- START -RRB- now under superpower negotiation. `` The verification of arms control limits on nuclear-armed SLCMs -LRB- sea-launched cruise missiles -RRB- does not present insuperable problems and can be accomplished at a level of both effectiveness and intrusiveness, which is likely to be characteristic of the other verification provisions of START,'' said the article by Ride and fellow physcists <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>. Ride left the shuttle program and is a professor of physics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said officials were studying the article and had no immediate comment. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers in particular have opposed including the missiles in START because they do not want Soviet inspectors aboard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> submarines and because they say it would be easy to circumvent a ban or reduction. The article contested that contention, proposing a detailed plan to inspect missiles at their point of origin, tag and seal them, and provide for inspections no more intrusive than others envisioned under START. Last September, the Soviets withdrew their insistence that the sea-launched cruise missile ban be included in START, but said they wanted a separate <ORGANIZATION> SLCM </ORGANIZATION> deal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officals have said a START pact, to reduce superpower nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent, might be ready by the time of a planned summit next spring or summer. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has approximately 370 nuclear and 1,670 long-range Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missiles that can be fired from about 70 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surface ships and submarines and have a range of about 1,600 miles, the article said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has an estimated 400 short-range nuclear SLCMs and has deployed a smaller number of nuclear SS-N-21 missiles, with a range of about 1,800 miles, it said. The article said that such missiles `` can not be readily, or safely, moved about or hidden on such ships.'' `` Furthermore, conversion of a Tomahawk from conventional to nuclear, although technically feasible, would be a complex and time-consuming operation that, pratically speaking, could be performed only at a factory,'' it said. `` Considerations such as these, taken together, suggest that <ORGANIZATION> SLCM </ORGANIZATION> verification is not the intractable problem it is often presented to be and that effective monitoring of SLCM deployments is possible without an unprecedented degree of intrusiveness,'' it said. `` Inspecting, tagging and sealing of SLCMs would be carried out in a special verification facility,'' it said. At each facility, superpower inspectors would assure that missiles were not nuclear and could not be changed at sea. Gamma ray levels from nuclear-armed SLCMs are sufficient to alert inspectors to deception, it said. Additionally, it said, scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> had developed a tag that could give each missile a distinctive `` fingerprint'' that would be read by shining a light at it from different angles. Similarly, it said, a tamperproof seal consisting of optic fibers had been developed to allow inspectors to assure that a missile had not been armed with a nuclear warhead. To break the ban, it said, `` a potential cheater'' would have to build a secret production facility, conduct clandestine tests, and covertly transport and deploy the missiles. `` Each of these steps would involve risks. Collectively they would represent a substantial level of activity, which would be difficult to hide,'' it said. Moreover, it said, `` the military significance of covertly produced nuclear SLCMs should not be exaggerated. Nuclear-armed SLCMs would need to be hidden on land rather than at sea, and `` in a rapidly developing crisis, covert SLCMs would not be available for use.'' `` There would be little incentive to attempt such cheating, since doing so would provide little in the way of reliable, available military capabilities that are not already provided by other weapons. ...'' it said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that it had grounded its fleet of AH-64 `` Apache'' attack helicopters after a flaw was discovered on two of the gunships during maintenance inspections. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement released at the Pentagon that the grounding of the 526 choppers, expected to last a few days, was a precautionary measure because a cracked retention nut was found on the two helicopters. The Apache is the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s newest and most sophisticated helicopter gunship. Army spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bomier </PERSON> said no accidents had been reported because of the problem, adding that it was the fourth grounding of the entire Apache fleet. The fleet, based throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, was grounded twice in 1986 and once earlier this year after an accident in which a piece of sheet metal struck a gunship's rotor blade. The grounding will remain in effect until an analysis of the part is completed at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. The analysis should result in information to identify the proper procedure for maintenance crews to follow, <PERSON> Bomier </PERSON> said. The part, known as the main rotor hub retention nut, holds the rotor onto the shaft of the aircraft, <PERSON> Bomier </PERSON> said. The co-pilot of an Army Nation Guard AH-64 was killed and the pilot seriously injured in a June 29 crash in northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> when the tail rotor came off the aircraft. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said its investigation found that a piece of sheet metal used to help secure a door had been improperly stored and that the piece of metal became dislodged and flew into the AH-64's tail rotor system The choppers, built by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> _ formerly <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopters </ORGANIZATION> _ cost about $ 13 million each. The gunship was commissioned to replace the Cobra as the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s primary attack helicopter The twin-engined Apache, designed to destroy enemy tanks, carries Hellfire and <ORGANIZATION> Hydra </ORGANIZATION> 7 missiles and a 30mm cannon.

<HEAD>Food Costs Lead Wholesale Prices to 0.4 Percent Rise</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS September to October in 12th graf, Economists said</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in October as the biggest spurt in food costs in 22 months offset the positive effects from moderating energy prices, the government reported Thursday. While the increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index was double what economists had been expecting, most of them stressed that they saw no reason for worries that inflationary pressures are threatening to get out of hand. The 0.4 percent October rise was down from a giant 0.9 percent September increase and many economists predicted that the news on inflation will continue to improve in coming months as a slowing economy takes more pressure off prices. For the first 10 months of this year, prices at the wholesale level have been rising at an annual rate of 5.2 percent, compared to an increase of 4 percent in 1988. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kottman </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said that he looked for wholesale inflation to return to an annual rate of 4 percent in 1990. `` Assuming that food and energy prices remain relatively stable, we expect further moderation in prices,'' he said. `` We do n't see any reason for prices to vault upward.'' Virtually all of the price pressure last month came from a sharp 1.4 percent jump in food costs, reflecting a 18.9 percent surge in vegetable prices that analysts blamed on weather problems in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Fruit, pork and fish prices also took a jump upward. The overall food advance was the biggest since a 1.5 percent spike in January 1988, but analysts noted that food costs had actually dropped in three of the previous four months. They called the October increase a temporary aberration and not a signal of spiraling food costs ahead. Energy costs, which had soared 6.5 percent in September, moderated in October, posting a modest 0.2 percent advance. Gasoline prices rose 2.3 percent but the cost of natural gas fell 2.5 percent while home heating oil prices edged down 0.5 percent. Wholesale prices, excluding energy and food costs, were up a tiny 0.1 percent in October. Many analysts consider this figure a better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures because both food and energy prices are volatile from month to month. New car prices fell by 1.4 percent in October as the new models were introduced, reflecting efforts by automakers to overcome sluggish demand by keeping a lid on price increases. Economists said the October wholesale price report provided support for the decision this week by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates in an effort to spur the economy. While the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been pressuring the central bank to lower rates in order to keep the country out of a recession, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had been resisting those moves because of fears that inflationary pressures were still too high. But many private economists said they believed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s rate reduction this week was appropriate given widespread evidence of economic weakness, particularly in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing sector, and reports showing that inflation is moderating. However, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> said Thursday that he believed that inflation needs to be reduced further, calling the current rate of increase in consumer prices `` too high.'' He called for consumer price increases to be shaved to the range of 3 percent, saying this goal would be acheived in the first half of 1990. So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual rate of 4.4 percent. Analysts said that <PERSON> Angell </PERSON>'s comments indicated that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> may be prepared to wait awhile before following this week's interest rate cut with further reductions. The Producer Price Index reflects the cost of goods one stop short of retail. Before adjusting for normal seasonal variation, the PPI stood at 114.8 in October, meaning that a marketbasket of goods costing $ 100 in the base year of 1982 would have cost $ 114.80 last month, up from $ 109.40 a year ago.

<TEXT>
 The new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> said Thursday she does not believe that visiting Libyans in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> pose any special security risk for next month's superpower summit. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are scheduled to hold shipboard meetings off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> on Dec. 2-3. Ambassador <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Novetzke </PERSON>, who presented her credentials Thursday to President <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabone </PERSON>, also said she considers it unlikely any meeting would be arranged between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> during the summit. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader and former prime minister, <PERSON> Karmenu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mifsud </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnici </PERSON>, on Wednesday called on the government to try to arrange a Bush-Gadhafi meeting in an effort `` to reduce tensions between the two countries.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has said previously it was not prepared to hold talks with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. It said last month that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is still providing funds, weapons, haven and training facilities to terrorists. <PERSON> Bonnici </PERSON> was the prime minister in April 1986, when <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> gave <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> advance warning of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air raids on the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. However, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> apparently did not act on the information. Then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the bombing raids were intended to punish <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> for its alleged support of international terrorism. The Socialists were voted out in 1986 after 16 years in power and the conservative government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON> has moved closer to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Novetzke </PERSON> said the fact that Libyans are allowed to freely visit <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> does not pose any special security risk for the summit. `` It is not a worry,'' she said.

<HEAD>Judge Approves $2.35 Million Pan Am Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge Thursday approved a $ 2.35 million settlement for 117 female flight attendants who sued <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> for using stricter weight standards for them than for men. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thelton </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said the settlement was fundamentally fair and highly favorable to the attendants despite objections from six women whose damage claims were fully or partially denied. The settlement will be shared by 117 women who were suspended, fired or denied promotions because of the weight policy, said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, an attorney for the Independent Union of Flight Attendants. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> also agreed to liberalize weight standards for current or future employees. The former policy used a 1959 insurance company table of heights and weights, but judged men under the standard for large frames and women under the standard for medium frames. A 5-foot-7 woman was allowed to weigh 139 pounds under the medium standard, but would have been allowed to weigh 150 under the large standard. The flight attendants' union sued <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, and won a ruling from <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> three years later in a non-jury trial that the policy was biased. The ruling was the first to find discrimination by an airline that had weight policies for both men and women, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoolman </PERSON> said at the time. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> ordered the airline to use a large-frame standard for all employees hired while the policy was in effect, through the end of 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> appealed <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>'s ruling, denying it had discriminated. The appeal is being dropped as part of the settlement, without any admission of discrimination. The settlement retains <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>'s previous order on weight standards and also increases some of the standards adopted by the airline in 1985, when it started setting weight requirements according to an employee's individual build. In addition, women hired after 1985 get another three-pound allowance at ages 35, 45 and 55. Although $ 2.5 million was less than the women might have gotten in individual damage claims, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said it was reasonable in light of the time an appeal would have taken and the risk that the entire amount would have been thrown out on appeal.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has approved a proposal from the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commander in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to cut the number of military dependents in the troubled region, the Pentagon announced Thursday. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s decision means that the majority of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> service personnel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will not be accompanied by family members and that only about 300 to 500 men and women in so-called `` key and essential positions'' will be allowed to bring dependents. The withdrawal of dependents began last spring following a series of incidents, including harassment and assaults against Americans. But the new military commander in the region, Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, suggested a further speed-up in the withdrawal following the failed coup attempt on Oct. 3 against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the Panamanian leader. Specifically, <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> recommended that tour lengths for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen and women be shortened and that those without families be given the shorter tours, thereby reducing the number of dependents. `` The changes were made to reduce the number of families in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by reducing the number of personnel authorized to bring family members with them. This action was recommended as a force protection measure to ensure the security and quality of life of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military members and their families in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Last May, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials began evacuating military dependents. As of July 1, some 6,300 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> personnel had either been sent home or relocated onto <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But there are still roughly 11,000 American dependents in the country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 10,000 soldiers permanently assigned to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, 2,500 military personnel there on temporary duty, 7,700 military dependents, 2,700 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> civilian <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees and 3,300 civilian dependents. The 30-month tour for those service personnel accompanied by families has been shortened to 24 months, while those without dependents will now serve a 12-month tour instead of 24, the statement said. <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> reportedly recommended the change to heighten the sense of military readiness among his troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has pressed for the removal of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on indictments charging drug trafficking. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he did not know when the new rotations would begin, but a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement said the tour lengths of those already stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` will be adjusted on a pro rata basis by the services.'' In a statement issued later in the day, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it expected to have the number of service personnel with families reduced to 300 to 500 level by mid-1990, but that several hundred families should be able to leave within the next month. The statement said there is `` no accurate way'' to determine how many dependents might be in the country if only 300 to 500 service personnel accompanied by family members were allowed to be in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It added that the new policy only affects military dependents, but that a plan is under review that would also apply to the dependents of civilian employees of the Pentagon stationed there.

 The Soviet government broke its silence Thursday on the rapid changes convulsing <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with praise for its ally's leadership shake-up and its first steps toward Soviet-style reforms. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said that although it was not the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s place to comment on another country's internal affairs, it was clear <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was undertaking a `` renewal of socialism.'' `` They're improving the situation in the sense that they're moving toward perestroika on their own terms,'' he told a news briefing, referring to the reforms President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began on coming to power in 1985 Millions of Soviets learned in TV, radio and newspaper reports of the dramatic overhaul of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ruling Politburo and new leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>'s promises of democratic reforms. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quickly reported that the East German government had thrown open all borders and that its citizens could travel or emigrate anywhere. <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Mostovoy </PERSON>, a correspondent reporting on Soviet television's widely watched nightly news program Vremya, said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had begun mapping political and economic reforms in a `` program which the whole country awaits and on which the future of the republic largely depends.'' <PERSON> Mostovoy </PERSON>, reporting from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, stressed the elevation of reformers to the Politburo. He quoted <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> as saying in a speech that the East German communist party leadership had earlier taken a negative approach to changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other socialist countries. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, had been cool to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and resisted implementing them in his own country. But <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in a telephone call last month that `` there are important lessons to be learned from Soviet perestroika in the German Democratic Republic.'' During a visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> discussed possible applications in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of Soviet-style reforms. `` We wholeheartedly support the revolutionary process of perestroika in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he told reporters, adding he especially wanted to explore its aim of making socialism `` more attractive.'' In its reports on East German developments, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> focused on that government's plans for a party conference and <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s call for more democracy. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> issued at least four reports. One report said the changes the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is discussing `` came from the street'' and that the party must admit its mistakes or lose its right to govern. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> ran excerpts of <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s 86-page speech Wednesday to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, highlighting his remarks on the former government's hostility toward the Soviet reforms. It quoted <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s condemnation of the old Politburo's `` negative wait-and-see attitude and partly dogmatic and haughty attitude to processes taking place in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other socialist countries.'' The Soviet government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> also gave readers details of <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s speech and reported the continuing mass exodus of East Germans. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Vremya </PERSON> showed <PERSON> Mostovoy </PERSON> standing against the backdrop of an outdoor public protest in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and describing the `` exceptionally important political events'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this week. `` The process of reform and renewal that started just a few weeks ago is continuing with unusual quickness,'' <PERSON> Mostovoy </PERSON> said in a report of about three minutes that came halfway through the 45-minute show. <PERSON> Mostovoy </PERSON> praised the East German press for `` covering events in detail and objectively'' and noted that thousands of people left the country in the past day as part of the continuing exodus to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Pravda carried a brief report on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, listing the new composition of the Politburo and noting the government's appeals to citizens to keep the country functioning normally.

 In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, unlike <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, much of the death brought by Hurricane Hugo came at the peak of the storm's impact, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government report concluded Thursday The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> looked at 29 injury deaths associated with Hurricane Hugo, as reported by officials in 25 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> counties. Thirteen of those deaths, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, occurred during the `` impact phase'' of the storm's assault on the state Sept. 21-22. The pattern was different in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, where the storm struck days earlier. There, only two of nine deaths occurred during the storm's impact; most of the deaths were electrocutions among repair workers after the storm. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, however, that in both <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the historical hurricane pattern of death by drowning in storm surges did not hold. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported just one storm-surge drowning in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, a 60-year-old woman who died in her mobile home. Five other people drowned while trying to bring boats inland at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. The other impact-phase deaths in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> included four people crushed in mobile homes, one person killed in the collapse of a house and two killed by falling trees. Most of the 16 injury deaths after the storm involved nine people who were killed in five separate house fires. The fires were blamed on the use of candles during power outages. Four people were electrocuted during clean-up and repair work, two people were killed by falling trees and one died in a chain-saw mishap. With the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> deaths in mind, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday recommended more efforts to educate the public in hurricane areas about the hazards of candles, the need to evacuate mobile homes and the hazards of boating during the approach of a killer storm. After the deaths in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> last month recommended greater precautions for electrical workers repairing hurricane damage.

<HEAD>Former FDA Official Says Food Labeling Bill Doesn't Go Far Enough</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday current proposals to revise food nutrition labeling requirements do n't go far enough and would omit labels on more than 60 percent of the food Americans eat. <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, former director of the Center for <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, told a food industry group the proposed legislation does n't cover restaurant food or meat and poultry. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., have introduced the `` Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1989,'' and hearings on the bill are scheduled to begin next week in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` I am most concerned because the bill simply does not go far enough,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, dean of the graduate school of Biomedical Sciences at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. `` Essentially the bill ignores two-thirds of the foods we eat regularly, many of which are high in fat and sodium, two of the nutrients for which many people have concern,'' he told a luncheon sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Chocolate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, in an interview, defended the legislation, saying, `` Our bill deals with practically all the foods on your grocery shelves, everything from misleading claims on cereal boxes to the saturated fat content in potato chips.'' `` It does not address labeling of meat and poultry but we hope the agricultural committees will follow our legislative lead,'' he added. Twenty-three groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, have endorsed the proposed legislation. One consumer group said the Chocolate Manufacturers wants to derail or dilute a proposed requirement to include a detailed breakdown of foods' fat content. `` The <ORGANIZATION> CMA </ORGANIZATION> does n't want the disclosure of saturated fats,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverglade </PERSON>, director of legal affairs for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. `` We believe that there should be nutritional labeling on meats and poultry as well as food under <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction but attempting to acccomplish all that in a single congressional session would cause the bill to collapse under its own weight,'' he said. `` A lot of the industry concerned are looking to try to make the bill weaker,'' said <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, `` but we're going to fight to keep this bill as a strong consumer information and protection bill.'' The legislation would require that nutrition labeling on all processed food under the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s jurisdiction list the serving size, number of servings per container, total calories and a breakdown of calories by total and saturated fat. Also required would be amounts by servings of fats _ total, saturated and unsaturated _ cholesterol, sodium, complex carbohydrates, protein, dietary fiber and other nutrients. Any health claims on labels would have to be sustantiated by a consensus of scientific reasoning and use terms defined by the secretary of health and human services.

<TEXT>
 The automobile industry can meet gasoline mileage standards proposed for the mid-1990s and beyond, but doing so would disrupt plans to improve vehicle performance and size, the Department of Energy says. In a letter to Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Nevada </LOCATION>, the department said the domestic new car fleet could meet or exceed a 32.8 miles per gallon average by 1995 and the 38.2 mpg average by 2001. Those are the standards <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> seeks in a bill that would update federal fuel-economy requirements. `` This certainly puts the gloom and doom comments of the industry into perspective,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, chairman of the consumer subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. `` The automobile industry may have cried wolf one too many times.'' <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, federal liaison director for the <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he had not seen the Energy Department letter. Told of its contents, he said it appeared to support the industry's contention that implementing the <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> standards would require a major overhaul of production plans for the next decade. `` The problem with the <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> approach is when you're trying to produce a full line of vehicles that meet various industry and family needs, it becomes difficult if not impossible'' to achieve his standards, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. `` If you want to produce 10 million tiny cars a year, they do have a niche in the market but it's not a huge niche.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>'s bill would require each manufacturer to improve its average fuel economy by at least 20 percent beginning with the 1995 model and 40 percent by the year 2001. In a Sept. 6 letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> posed a series of questions about the industry's ability to comply. Industry spokesmen contend the proposed standards are unrealistic. In its response, signed by Deputy Undersecretary <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuntz </PERSON>, the department said domestic vehicle manufacturers could achieve an average of 32 to 33 mpg for new passenger cars by 1995 `` if they modified product plans to make maximum use of available technology and return to 1987 levels of vehicle size, performance and luxury.'' `` While it is theoretically feasible, we do not believe it is practical to return to the earlier -LRB- 1987 -RRB- levels of performance and size by 1995,'' the department's letter said. `` To do so would greatly disrupt current product plans and lessen manufacturers' ability to apply the available fuel economy technology and, at the same time, achieve emissions, safety and possibly alternative fuels goals,'' the letter said.

 Police reported more bombing attempts Thursday against <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members who elected <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s new president, and <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> pursued talks on forming a Cabinet of national reconciliation. Sources among Western diplomats said Thursday the diplomats will shun Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> for the past 13 months, who has refused to recognize the election of the president election last weekend. `` There has been a decision to boycott <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>,'' said one diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. French Ambassador <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ala </PERSON> was the last diplomat to visit <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> on Sunday. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> dismissed as unconstitutional Parliament's election in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that day and refused to leave the presidential palace in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> to allow <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, to settle in there. Police reported Thursday that a 66-pound bomb was defused minutes before it was set to explode late Wednesday outside the apartment of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> deputy <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassine </PERSON> in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ashrafiyeh </LOCATION> neighborhood A police spokesman said a small bomb did explode Tuesday under the car of Christian deputy <PERSON> Nasri </PERSON> <PERSON> Maalouf </PERSON> in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hazmiyeh </LOCATION> district and another went off overnight under the car of Druse deputy <PERSON> Toufik </PERSON> <PERSON> Assaf </PERSON> in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The attacks caused damage but no casualties, said the spokesman, who can not be identified under standing regulations. At least six bombs have targeted deputies in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> since Nov. 3. Five of them exploded. No one claimed responsibility and each side blamed the other. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s election was under terms of a peace plan that would cede more political power to the Moslem majority and end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> complained that the plan lacked a timetable for total withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops here. He fought the Syrian forces for six months until an Arab League-sponsored cease-fire in September. The Syrians are in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, 64, set up headquarters at the prime minister's office in Syrian-policed west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, becoming the first Christian president to operate from the city's Moslem sector in 31 years. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem, and then with <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> who headed the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> before the presidential election. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, supports <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> and submitted his Cabinet's resignation Monday to facilitate formation of a new government. <PERSON> Husseni </PERSON> later told reporters that `` consultations are continuing. The objective is the formation of a national reconciliation government which, most probably, will be an expanded one.'' <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> also met with Moslem and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> deputies and with former ministers. Syrian soldiers ringed the area to protect the new president, causing a traffic jam. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s meetings came a day after a car bomb explosion near his intended residence killed four people and wounded 19.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> conceded Thursday that its employees violated regulations in accepting free training from <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, which has been investigating mismanagement of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s automated data processing service, said at least 128 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials were improperly trained by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, from 1985 to 1987 The disclosure came just one day after the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> testified that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> showed partiality toward <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in awarding millions of dollars of computer contracts. `` It's as if all the laws and regulations are being evaded, and that we have very serious problems in terms of having open and fair competition in government procurement,'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Affairs subcommittee on legislation and national security, said Thursday `` It is my opinion that acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> vendor training was not in accordance with the controlling regulations,'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, assistant general counsel on ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` Consequently, government travel funds should not have been authorized in the first instance for such a purpose. However, they were,'' he said. Specifically, he said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s selection of employees to attend the training program violated <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rules on accepting free vendor training. The training represented an impermissible gratuity, <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Easter </PERSON>, program manager for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, defended its program, saying none of the company's `` executive education offerings ... were devised for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> _ or any other particular customer or set of customers.'' Easter said federal employees, including the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, made up `` but a small fraction of the attendees at these <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> classes during the entire period being considered by the committee.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inquiries were prompted by a November 1988 letter from six <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> competitors in which they said they had been frozen out of much of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s multibillion-dollar computer market The companies complained to then-Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials had tailored the bid specifications so that only <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> could win although many of the companies offer `` clones'' or duplicates of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> systems at lower prices.

 Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> met jointly for the first time Thursday with the government `` supermediator'' named to resolve the bitter and often violent 7-month-old strike. No significant progress was reported in a session said to be largely dedicated to setting the groundrules for intensive negotiations set to begin Monday. `` I'm absolutely convinced that both sides want a contract,'' mediator W.J. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> said after the session. `` We need the jobs. We need people back to work and we need paychecks.'' <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>, a former labor secretary and veteran mediator, spent 75 minutes in a joint meeting with the two sides and then had several, shorter talks with company and union representatives in separate rooms. Both sides agreed to negotiate throughout next week and also to refuse to discuss the substance of those talks with the press, <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> said. The walkout began in April and has kept 1,700 miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> of the job. Their picketing has been marred by sporadic violence and the union has been heavily fined for defying court orders restricting its demonstrations. The biggest issue in the dispute is over <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s payments of health and retirement benefits, a fight whose outcome could have far-reaching effects in the coal industry. The session was the first at which <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> sat face-to-face with their respective negotiating teams as well as the first joint meeting with <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>, who was named as mediator two weeks ago by Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> both had praise for <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> after the meeting but no substantive progress to report. `` We were n't dealing with substance,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said. `` We're just going over ground rules.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said he was willing to do `` whatever I can do to help with the process.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> participated in the entire joint session but left a short time later, leaving behind the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> team. `` I've got to get back,'' he said when leaving, presumably referring to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> said he did not want <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> at the talks next week unless a settlement appeared within reach As for <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said he was `` very impressed'' with the mediator and <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> added: `` If anyone can get this job done I think <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> can.''

 West German politicians praised communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s decision Thursday to open its borders and said the <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> had lost its purpose. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, on a state visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, said he wanted to meet soon with <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, who became the East German leader last month. `` We will be in contact with the East German leadership shortly after my return,'' he said. Of the open borders, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said only, `` It is too soon to tell what will develop out of the decision.'' Other leaders were more enthusiastic. <PERSON> Hans-Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, said it `` means that after 28 years, the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall has lost its function.'' <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohl </PERSON>, a government leader in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should `` start tearing down the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall tomorrow.'' Officials in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> have said the decision to allow freer travel did not mean the wall had lost its purpose. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo told reporters Thursday it still had value as the demarcation line between the two military alliances, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cornelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmalz-Jacobsen </PERSON>, general secretary of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, called the opening of borders `` an historic hour for the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people.''

<TEXT>
 A federal judge Thursday refused to bar the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> from starting construction on a submarine acoustical testing facility in a prime fishing and recreation area in southeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> denied a motion for a preliminary injunction by the <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and six other organizations to stop the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s planned <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acoustic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Measurement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION>, known as SEAFAC, in <LOCATION> Ketchikan </LOCATION> Gateway Borough. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plans to build measurement sites in the center of western Behm Canal, northwest of <LOCATION> Back </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and shore facilities on <LOCATION> Back </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> anticipates tests would be under way for up to 75 days a year and during these periods access to some areas of Behm Canal would be restricted or prohibited. The organizations argued that the project will threaten the environment of the <LOCATION> Behm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> area and threaten sport and commercial fishing and recreational activities in the area. They said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> failed to meet the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which requires an assessment of the project's impact. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fulfilled the mandate of <ORGANIZATION> NEPA </ORGANIZATION> by giving `` serious consideration'' to the socioeconomic impacts of SEAFAC and that national security interests would be compromised by issuing a preliminary injunction. The judge noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has taken a number of steps, including scheduling testing for times that avoid major fishing events. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> also has agreed to notify the community in advance of testing dates to allow people to plan around the restrictions. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is having increasing difficulty monitoring noise levels of submarines at the two existing facilities serving the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> fleet _ <ORGANIZATION> Carr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inlet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> says it can not adequately monitor the Trident class of nuclear subs because of increasing surrounding noise levels in the areas and because the subs are quieter than earlier models.

 <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> have moved closer to solving a 157-year-old territorial dispute following a meeting between presidents of the neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations, state radio said Thursday. <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyte </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> agreed Wednesday in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> to appoint a mediator to settle the dispute that involves 60 percent of <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>'s land, including all of its mineral-rich western region. Since 1832, 11 years after gaining independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has laid claims to the territory. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> said the British, who first made claims on the land that became <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> in the late 16th century, had taken territory that had belonged to the Spanish Empire for decades. The Dutch, who had a competing claim in the region, ceded the territory to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1814. Tense relations attributed to the land claim did not subside with <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1966, and only began to improve when <PERSON> Hoyte </PERSON> came to power in 1985. <PERSON> Hoyte </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Alister </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, vice chancellor of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION>, as mediator.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> barred the leader of the Contra rebels from holding a news conference on Thursday, citing legal constraints on use of federal funds that bought his ticket to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Galeano </PERSON>, who goes by the nom de guerre Commander <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, had scheduled an afternoon press conference to discuss the rebels' position on elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and their decision to fight back against attack by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, a conservative activist who set up the news conference. But <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> was told by a lawyer at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> there that he could not go to the news conference, participants said. The reason given was that his trip was being paid for by taxpayer funds which can not be used to influence public opinion, according to <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> and to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. But <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials of trying to `` muzzle'' <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> out of fear he might say something to jeopardize talks between Contra representatives and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> that began Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said the caution on use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds stems from revelations in the Iran-Contra affair that changed the climate for trotting out the U.S.-backed Contras to present their points of view. `` Iran-Contra changed the entire approach to these kinds of activities,'' the official said. A department lawyer cited the law as prohibiting use of taxpayer funds to influence public opinion, said the official. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschmann </PERSON>, research director for the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, said his non-profit lobbying organization had offered to pay for <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s ticket, but that the administration blocked that offer. Some 25 reporters who showed up at the news conference were informed by an associate of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> that he could not come because he had to take a call from those involved in the talks at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>. That was not the case, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said through <PERSON> Hirschmann </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has a history of constantly trying to gag them,'' <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> had planned to release a letter, which he delivered to vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> later. The letter stated the Contras throught it `` would be foolish'' to lay down their arms before the scheduled Nicaraguan elections next Feb. 25 because they need to defend themselves against attack by the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, at the first direct talks between the contras and <LOCATION> Sandinistsa </LOCATION> in more than a year, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> said they would meet Contra demands for a truce and amnesty if the rebels agree to begin disbanding by the end of the month.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and its other borders Thursday, and its cheering citizens crossed freely to the West for the first time since 1961. Late Thursday, exultant East Germans began passing through <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall checkpoints and others entered <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at other border crossings. Jubilant people pranced and danced atop the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, a sight unthinkable only hours earlier. Hundreds were seen on the <LOCATION> Friedrichstrasse </LOCATION> subway to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, and East Germans also were allowed for the first time at Checkpoint Charlie, the famed <LOCATION> Friedrichstrasse </LOCATION> crossing run by the Allied military. Many hugged and kissed total strangers, while cars packed with East Germans and others paraded down the streets of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in a carnival-like atmosphere. `` It's crazy! It's crazy!'' yelled one young man as he sat in the back seat of a car with his parents after a brief trip through the once-impenetrable <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. His parents said they just wanted to see the West _ and then drive back. They declined to give their names. `` We heard it on TV, we just decided to go over and have a look,'' said the young man's father. `` We want to show our son a little bit of Kurfuerstendamm.'' The Kurfuerstendamm is one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most elegant shopping strips. For decades, East Germans locked up behind the now-crumbling Iron Curtain could only dream of seeing it. All apparently were arriving without visas, although visas technically were necessary under regulations announced earlier in the day. A spokesman for the West German border police in <LOCATION> Braunschweig </LOCATION> said the East Germans had been allowed over the border there without visas. About 100 East Berliners gathered at the <LOCATION> Brandenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>, just inside the wall, and chanted: `` Open the gate! Open the gate!'' With decades of fortified frontiers apparently at an end, the wall that symbolized <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> division for decades may become a mere monument to the Cold War. Since it appeared during an August night 28 years ago and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders were sealed, 191 people are known to have died while fleeing to the West. <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new leader, also advocated a law Thursday that would ensuring free and democratic elections in his communist nation, which has been disrupted by pro-reform demonstrations and weakened by mass flight to the West. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> scheduled a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference for Dec. 15-17. Party conferences are forums for making major changes in policy and the last one was held in 1956. More than 200,000 East Germans, nearly 1 -LCB- percent of the population, have left so far this year _ 50,000 since Saturday alone. Most are young, skilled workers vital to the economy. Hundreds of thousands of people who stayed home have filled the streets to demand democratic reforms and an end to 40 years of rigid one-party rule. As the news spread the number of East Germans heading for <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> rose dramatically. The official East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported up to 4,000 per hour entering <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Schoenberg </LOCATION> crossing, 10 times the number of people entering <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> a few hours earlier. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo, said the borders were being opened until a law was passed to allow East Germans greater freedom of travel. <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> did not say when the law would be passed. He also said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was not yet ready to remove all its barriers. The Central Committee decision means all East Germans `` can travel over all East German border checkpoints,'' including through the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> told reporters. He said those seeking to emigrate could go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> directly without having to pass through a third country. East Germans have fled through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Anyone merely wanting to visit the West would need a visa, <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> said, but they should be issued quickly. He did not mention limits on time that could be spent abroad. Offices that issue travel visas had closed for the night by the time <PERSON> Schabowki </PERSON> made the historic announcement, so no further information was available. East Germans reacted with astonishment and jubilation. `` Is it really true?'' asked <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, 18. `` Now I no longer feel locked in here,'' said <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Landgraf </PERSON>, 28, who hoped to travel to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` I think that even some of those who left recently will come back now,'' said a 25-year-old electrician who identified himself only as <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the 77-year-old leader <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> replaced last month, supervised the building of the wall before he became Communist Party chief. Every <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president since <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has urged that it be torn down. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called Thursday's announcement a `` dynamic development ... clearly a big development in terms of human rights.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the decision amounts to `` the symbolic destruction of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall,'' and urged <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to `` take the final step and tear that wall down.'' `` The wall is the most tangible symbol of the failure of communism,'' he said. West German leaders hailed the decision. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, on an official visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, said: `` We will be in contact with the East German leadership shortly after my return and I would like to meet very soon with Mr. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>.'' Fifteen prominent Communist intellectuals and officials in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> wrote to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> suggesting the wall be torn down. `` It is also imaginable, even in the foreseeable future, that the wall will become a relic of the past'' if an agreement is signed with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that would prevent `` damage to the East German economy,'' they said. The letter was published Thursday in the <ORGANIZATION> Berliner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION>, a party newspaper. As protest and flight gathered momentum this week, the leadership took increasingly desperate steps in an attempt to turn the tide. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> purged the old guard from the party Politburo and slimmed it down from 21 members to 11. An ADN dispatch said the party conference next month would consider personnel changes in the 163-member Central Committee. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, 52, touched on multiparty elections in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that official newspapers published Thursday. He recommended a `` new election law that ensures free, democratic general elections with a secret ballot'' and proposed `` public supervision in every stage of the balloting.'' He did not say whether he wanted a true multiparty system in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but has said previously the supremacy of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is not open to debate. Officials define the current election system, which guarantees the Communists virtually unanimous approval, as democratic. The new leader also promised laws on freedom of assembly, association and the press. He gave no details, but said independent groups might have a role in politics. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s pro-democracy opposition has made free elections its main demand. Plans have been reported to legalize New Forum, the largest group.

 A federal jury on Thursday convicted a margarine heiress and a Colombian co-defendant of helping her unemployed boyfriend run a cocaine ring out of her mansion. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Filbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>, the 35-year-old granddaughter of the founder of Mrs. <PERSON> Filbert </PERSON>'s Margarine, and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, a 32-year-old Colombian living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, face a maximum sentence of life in prison. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Breckenridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> said prosecutors would probably recommend at least 10 years in prison without parole for each of the defendants. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> set sentencing for Feb. 14. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> were each found guilty of two counts of distribution of cocaine and one count of conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine.

Defense attorney <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> had argued that <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> was guilty only of possession. He said Case distributed cocaine, while <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> was an addict, spending as much as $ 2,000 a week to support her habit. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>' $ 750,000 five-acre estate, including the mansion, has been seized by the government because of the drug case. <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> said, `` There's sort of a bigger message here. Even relatively uninvolved participants in a major conspiracy, people who do n't actually lug the cocaine around, even if they are knowing participants, they are going to be convicted and serve as much time as the major participants.''

 Thousands of .22 - caliber semiautomatic pistols called Scorpions, which may switch without warning to an automatic function, are being recalled by the manufacturer under an agreement reached with federal authorities, the government announced `` A flawed part used in the manufacture of the Scorpion .22 semiautomatic pistol may cause the gun to malfunction, including turning the semiautomatic into an automatic,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said in a statement.

In an automatic weapon, one pull of the trigger can dispatch numerous shots. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 banned sales of automatic weapons made on or after May 15, 1986, to all purchasers the armed services and law enforcement agencies. The Scorpion is manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Intratec </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, a Miami-based firearms firm, according to <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Killorin </PERSON>. The company says it has sold about 20,000 of the guns and has an additional 27,000 in a warehouse. The <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> will supervise the recall and repair to make sure the guns are working properly before they are allowed back on the market, <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Dot <PERSON> Koester </PERSON> said. The bureau became aware of the problem several weeks ago, when consumers began to complain, <PERSON> Koester </PERSON> said, adding that she did not believe the malfunction had caused any injuries. `` A guy takes it out into the backyard to shoot a can and all of a sudden his garage door falls apart,'' she said, giving an example of the type of complaint he <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> received on the gun which generally sells for about $ 200. After the complaints started coming in, the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> `` sent some of our agents out to buy them off the shelves to test them, and we found the same thing,'' <PERSON> Koester </PERSON> said. `` Some of them may be all right, but nobody knows for sure.'' `` ATF has obtained an agreement from <ORGANIZATION> Intratec </ORGANIZATION> to recall the Scorpions and to repair them,'' the bureau said in a statement. Dealers and owners were advised to contact the manufacturer concerning the recall. The malfunction in the gun stems from `` not using enough heat when they tempered one part of the firearm,'' <PERSON> Koester </PERSON> said. `` According to our firearms technology people, this can be easily remedied.'' <ORGANIZATION> Intratec </ORGANIZATION> had given blueprints of the gun to <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> before it began producing them in April 1988, she said, adding that such an action went beyond government regulations and was not required. `` Unfortunately their blueprint did not take into account this flaw of the heat,'' she said. Negotiations with the firm that resulted in the recall took two days, Wednesday and Thursday, she said. Asked if the gun's occasional automatic firepower might make it attractive to criminals who would try to buy it, <PERSON> Koester </PERSON> said, `` We hope not. `` The gun really is a danger because it does malfunction,'' she said. `` It's not dependable that it will shift into automatic. It really is a broken gun, so it would be really stupid of them to do that.'' The same company manufactures the Tech 9, another semiautomatic pistol that is equipped with a threaded barrel for silencers. `` That's the one the Jamaican posses, for example, like.'' The company is located at 12405 130th Street, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

 There were wild scenes at Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous crossing in the infamous <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, when hundreds of East Germans arrived Thursday night and tried to get through. Minutes after West German television said it had heard East Germans were allowed to cross at Checkpoint <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, about 300 East Berliners arrived carrying only their identity papers. Watched by cheering West Berliners, waving from 50 yards away, the East Germans tried to persuade their border police to let them through. `` I just want to go over and have a good time,'' one man said. `` We've got to get back to work tomorrow.'' `` Let us have a beer over there,'' a woman said. `` We'll come back.'' `` We're coming right away!'' the East Germans shouted to West Berliners on the other side. Suddenly, the border guards relented and hundreds of people ran through toward the customs hall, waved on by East German officials. At the last barrier, the crowd encountered locked doors. Guards urged everyone to be patient and distributed cards to be filled out. `` Just so we know who went through,'' one guard explained. `` This is a historic day!'' a man yelled. `` We're going to be able to tell our children about this!'' Then came disappointment. Border guards said no one could go through without a visa stamp from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police, which they could get only when police stations re-opened Friday morning. `` This is kindergarten,'' one youth grumbled. Eventually, the crowd was persuaded to turn back, but 34-year-old <PERSON> Angelika </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachs </PERSON> slipped through the door when it was opened to let an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent through. `` Ja-a-a-a,'' she whispered gleefully, then came tense seconds as the East German guard checked her newly issued passport, which contained a visa allowing her to visit <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> beginning next week. When she got past the controls and saw the screaming, cheering West Berliners gathered to welcome any arrivals from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, she cried: `` This is unbelievable! I ca n't believe it!'' She raced off to find a ride to a friend's house in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Charlottenburg </LOCATION>. Later, hundreds more East Germans arrived at Checkpoint <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> and, finally, they too were let through. The flood of new arrivals continued into the night, a historic night.

<TEXT>
 Operators of a government-owned nuclear production plant said Thursday that area residents were exposed to virtually no tritium as a result of an accidental release of the radioactive gas. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neff </PERSON>, manager of environment, safety and health at the Mound Nuclear Production Plant, said off-site air samples showed a slight increase over normal levels of tritium, which is radioactive hydrogen. But the maximum dose to each of the 2,400 residents under the radioactive cloud from Wednesday's release was 0.00012 millirems, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s standard of safe dosage is 25 millirems a year. `` You're getting down to a range where it is essentially nothing,'' said <PERSON> Neff </PERSON>, adding that such levels are difficult to measure. `` The chance of a person getting cancer from this is roughly equivalent to smoking 14 cigarettes.'' <PERSON> Neff </PERSON> said that of the 52 workers evacuated from the building, six had shown low levels of radiation in their systems. But he said further testing revealed that those levels may have been the result of the workers' regular handling of tritium. `` We do n't have any concentrations greater than what we would expect from normal operations,'' he said. `` We do n't see any workers who we feel have any significant exposure from this event.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morley </PERSON>, Dayton-area manager for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> will investigate the incident. The radioactive gas was released into the air and fell over a three-mile area northwest of the plant, extending over a section of downtown <LOCATION> Miamisburg </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The plant enriches tritium gas, which is used in combination with plutonium to act as a trigger for nuclear weapons. A total of 3.7 grams of tritium was released through an exhaust vent, about 10 times what the plant normally releases in a year. The release occurred when a quartz window in a bell jar containing tritium shattered during a laser-drilling operation. About 2,200 workers are employed at the Mound Plant, which is operated for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> by </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G Mound Applied Technologies.

 The sheriff Thursday disbanded a squad of about 20 officers from nine counties brought together for a murder investigation that turned up four bodies buried in barns. <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON> said the investigation would continue with help from the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, but that other counties could not afford to continue providing help.

Officers began digging on the northwest <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> farm of <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> after he and his wife, <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, were arrested Oct. 9 in an alleged cattle swindle. They remained jailed on $ 25,000 bond each, charged with conspiracy to steal.

 Former Indian activist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Satiacum </PERSON> was ordered deported to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Thursday, hours after he was convicted of fondling a 10-year-old girl in an unrelated case. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has been trying to extradite the former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Puyallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribe </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state for several years on embezzlement and racketeering convictions. `` I am bound in law to issue you with a deportation order,'' said immigration adjudicator <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Braunwarth </PERSON>. `` I have no alternative. The law permits no discretion.'' <PERSON> Satiacum </PERSON>, 60, who contended he was persecuted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, lost his bid for refugee status in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> Nov. 2, allowing the deportation proceedings to reopen. The deportation hearing did not deal with <PERSON> Satiacum </PERSON>'s conviction for sexual touching. <PERSON> Satiacum </PERSON> is to be sentenced on that charge Nov. 17. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years. Lawyers for the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> government and <PERSON> Satiacum </PERSON> argued Thursday over whether he should be deported before he served his sentence on the sex charge. <PERSON> Satiacum </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilford </PERSON>, said the deportation hearing should be adjourned pending a decision from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> on <PERSON> Satiacum </PERSON>'s claim for refugee status. `` It's improper for <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> to be seen as attempting an end-run around the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Satiacum </PERSON>, who fled to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1982, faces a lengthy jail sentence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His problems began with his battle over selling tax-free cigarettes on Indian land and escalated from there. He was originally granted political asylum in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1987 but the decision was overturned this year. <PERSON> Satiacum </PERSON>, who has diabetes and a bad heart, spent three years in jail while he fought efforts to extradite him. Thursday morning, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> court Judge <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> convicted him of touching a person under 14 for sexual purposes. `` This verdict is worse than the verdict of murder,'' a weary-looking <PERSON> Satiacum </PERSON> said. `` It takes away my whole future.'' <PERSON> Satiacum </PERSON> continued to maintain his innocence, saying he did not touch the girl in April 1988 while he was staying at a house in suburban <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> owned by her grandmother. He said he may appeal the verdict. The girl testified she awoke to find <PERSON> Satiacum </PERSON> with his hand beneath her underwear. <PERSON> Satiacum </PERSON> testified he had tripped over the girl, who was asleep on the floor, and fell partly on her but did not molest her. `` I reject Mr. <PERSON> Satiacum </PERSON>'s evidence as untruthful,'' the judge said.

They were not immediately released from the jury pool. `` Obviously, that's going to be a very great topic for individual questioning,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>. Before the trial, <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said he would look for jurors who had an understanding of the widespread incidence of drunken driving. The 1988 accident was considered the deadliest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history to be blamed on drunken driving. Prospective jurors were also asked about previous jury service in the second day of jury selection in this county seat about 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. Other questions included whether they were related to anyone involved in the trial and issues expected to be raised during the trial. Some jurors were dismissed for such routine reasons as a family sickness or full-time student status. Attorneys plan to interview prospective jurors privately next week. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> is accused of driving the wrong way on Interstate 71 on May 14, 1988 when his pickup truck slammed into a bus from the Radcliff Assembly of God church. Twenty-seven people, all but three of them children, died in the fiery crash. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was found to have a blood-alcohol content of .24, nearly 2 -LCB- times the limit of .10 for being considered legally intoxicated. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> is charged with 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton endangerment, 12 counts of assault and one of driving under the influence. If convicted of all charges, he faces a maximum sentence of 27 life prison terms plus 450 years. Jury selection was expected to last at least through next week.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official resigned in 1988 following an investigation of suspicions that he disclosed classified information to a foreign government, said a report released Thursday. The annual report of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> said a counterintelligence investigation did not produce sufficient evidence to prosecute the official but determined he should be dismissed. The report did not identify the official, but <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asylum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed he was the subject of parallel investigations by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the Office of Professional Responsiblity in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials refused to comment on the case. But a source who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> had been the subject of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> counterintelligence investigation. <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> insists that he is innocent of the allegation that he or his wife, <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON>, passed a secret <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> document about communist influence in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to the South African government. And <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> produced a 1988 letter from a senior <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official stating that he was being reinstated after the investigations. `` No implication adverse to you should be taken from the investigations,'' said the letter by <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, then the principal associate deputy attorney general. <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> said he accepted reinstatement at the department, which restored his security clearance, but he then left to join the <ORGANIZATION> Cato </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a libertarian think tank where he is now a senior fellow. `` Something is going on and it stinks if people like us can be dragged through the mud,'' said <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON>. `` It's been a nightmare, a Kafkaesque nightmare.'' <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents showed him the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> documents while his wife was undergoing a <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check for appointment as an assistant secretary of the interior. The agents `` plopped this document on my desk'' and said `` ` That document is now in the hands of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. You gave it to your wife, your wife gave it to the South Africans.''' <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> said he and his wife, then an analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, both passed government polygraph tests, commonly called lie detector tests. But the investigation dragged on and his wife was never nominated for the job at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The Jan. 8, 1987, document in question was a secret assessment of the influence of communism in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> produced by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> had worked at State as policy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> before joining the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in March, 1987. <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> said he suspects the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had monitored a conversation between his wife, who studied <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> affairs, and an official of the South African mission in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The phone calls with <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Camp </PERSON>, a public affairs attache at the South African mission, took place in January or February of 1987, <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> said. `` She had been trying to get documents from him about communist activity at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. He wanted material she had been working on.'' `` Undoubtedly there was a conversation -LRB- about -RRB- an exchange of documents,'' <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> said, who insisted his wife never passed along he document <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents had shown him. <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is apparently still investigating what happened to the document. Two of the same <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents had recently approached a friend, <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> said, and asked about the document. `` I can only speculate as to what's going on here. I really do n't know,'' <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> said.

 The Soviet government advised the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> on Thursday to dismiss any speculation about a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> now because that `` is out of the question.'' In the first government comment on the changes convulsing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s ally, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for its leadership shake-up and its first steps toward Soviet-style reforms. He told a news briefing that although it was not the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s place to comment on another country's internal affairs, it was clear <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was undertaking a `` renewal of socialism.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> called <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> an `` important, one might say, strategic ally'' of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is closely following events there. In its account of the briefing, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported: `` Commenting on deliberations in the Western press about the possible reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, ... -LRB- <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> -RRB- said, specifically, that this matter ` can not be viewed apart from the overall situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which is, as of yet, split into two alliances.' `` He appraised the deliberations in the press as an ` occupation not related to practical policy.''' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said, `` If we remain on real ground, any unification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is out of question now.'' <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s division into communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and capitalistic <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> followed the collapse of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War II. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> now is being shaken by mass demands for more democracy and by an exodus of East Germans to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, prompting the changes there this week. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said Thursday that the East German leadership is `` improving the situation in the sense that they're moving toward perestroika on their own terms,'' referring to the reforms President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began on coming to power in 1985. Millions of Soviets learned in TV, radio and newspaper reports of the dramatic overhaul of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ruling Politburo and new leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>'s promises of democratic reforms. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quickly reported that the East German government had thrown open all borders and that its citizens could travel or emigrate anywhere. <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Mostovoy </PERSON>, a correspondent reporting on Soviet television's popular nightly news program Vremya, said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had begun mapping political and economic reforms in a `` program which the whole country awaits and on which the future of the republic largely depends.'' <PERSON> Mostovoy </PERSON>, reporting from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, stressed the elevation of reformers to the Politburo. He quoted <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> as saying in a speech that the East German communist party leadership had earlier taken a negative approach to changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other socialist countries. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, had been cool to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and resisted implementing them in his own country. But <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in a telephone call last month that `` there are important lessons to be learned from Soviet perestroika in the German Democratic Republic.'' During a visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> discussed possible applications in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of Soviet-style reforms. `` We wholeheartedly support the revolutionary process of perestroika in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he told reporters, adding he especially wanted to explore its aim of making socialism `` more attractive.'' In its reports on East German developments, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> focused on that government's plans for a party conference and <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s call for more democracy. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> issued at least four reports. One report said the changes the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is discussing `` came from the street'' and that the party must admit its mistakes or lose its right to govern. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> ran excerpts of <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s 86-page speech Wednesday to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, highlighting his remarks on the former government's hostility toward the Soviet reforms. It quoted <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s condemnation of the old Politburo's `` negative wait-and-see attitude and partly dogmatic and haughty attitude to processes taking place in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other socialist countries.'' The Soviet government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> also gave readers details of <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s speech and reported the continuing mass exodus of East Germans. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Vremya </PERSON> showed <PERSON> Mostovoy </PERSON> standing against the backdrop of an outdoor public protest in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and describing the `` exceptionally important political events'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this week. `` The process of reform and renewal that started just a few weeks ago is continuing with unusual quickness,'' <PERSON> Mostovoy </PERSON> said in a report of about three minutes that came halfway through the 45-minute show.

<TEXT>
 Governors meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials said Thursday that work on national education goals is on a `` very, very fast track'' and they are now ready to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting between leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials was a follow-up to the education summit between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the nation's governors in September. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and educators had been excluded from the two-day discussions in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> that concluded nationwide goals are needed to improve learning. `` The involvement of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is essential in my opinion, and in the opinion of the White House and others, as we seek to form a true coalition between the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the states and the executive branch of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in trying to build a consensus to improve education in the country,'' said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> after the White House meeting. Not only will <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> be courted, but the governors decided to seek the advice of experts and recommendations from educators and business executives communities at a Dec. 7 meeting. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be asked to begin immediately to work on legislation that would bring more flexibility to what is now considered rigid regulations attached to many federal programs. Loosening restrictions on federal funds was one target chosen at the <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION> meeting. Other summit goals were to improve early childhood programs, reorganize school systems to make educators more accountable, keep drugs out of schools, bolster on-the-job education, improve literacy and reduce dropouts. <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said Thursday's meeting with Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>; <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, the president's domestic policy adviser; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>; and Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> was `` very constructive'' and `` we've agreed that we're going to continue to work to develop the national goals for education.'' After the Dec. 7 <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Education meeting, the governors will hold state hearings and discussions in their respective states in December and January, said <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state.

<BYLINE>PRESIDENT BUSH</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 `` Part of the enduring friendship between our nations has been on our shared sacrifices as we fought together side by side _ a poignant reminder in these turbulent days of the cost of freedom. ... `` We want to help the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> strengthen its democracy and continue its economic recovery, and we've offered our belief that a new long-term security agreement will enhance our mutual security. ... A new agreement will preserve bipartisan support for this continued economic and military aid.'' `` Part of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s love of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is based on pure unabashed sentiment and optimism. Americans have cheered the people power ... revolution, which galvanized the world, inspiring freedom-loving people everywhere. And you, Mrs. President, proved that ballots are stronger than bullets, and that while democracy can be delayed, ultimately it can not be denied. `` And your accomplishments since 1986 are monumental: a new constitution in 1987; free elections for thousands of local and national leaders, the restoration of press freedom and other civil liberties, and in just a few short years the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> has gone from a deep recession to steady economic growth. And we urge you to continue with the free market reforms needed to spur Philippine economic development. `` Political and economic freedom are the destiny of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> people, and the destiny of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people must be and is to stand with you.'' `` You have said that being a grandparent makes you happier than being president. Well, <PERSON> Cory </PERSON>, if you'll excuse the informality, that just's one more thing that you and I agree on,'' he said, raising a glass and toasting to U.S.-Philippine friendship and `` to a better world for our grandchildren and for children everywhere.''

<BYLINE>PRESIDENT AQUINO</BYLINE>

 `` I have returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a world much changed by startling events. In Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> the men of iron vision are loosening peacefully their long grip on power.'' Recalling her own country's revolution, she said, `` The memory of that stirring event is engraved in the heart of all Filipinos who lived through it and deeply impressed in the memory of the world.'' `` The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is a small country and can not claim to affect directly events beyond its borders. Certainly not across half the world in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Yet it is not too much to say that the images of heroism spawned by our people power revolution gave dominated peoples throughout the world a glimpse of certain possibilities that they are now exploring _ the possibility, for example, that armor and infantry do not exhaust the varieties of power; that perhaps people by peaceful numbers and unshakeable resolve may sometimes tilt the balance in their favor _ as they saw it happen in my country and as it has happened in other parts of the world since then. `` For the first time in a long time something different has happened in the world, and perhaps the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> had something to do with it. If so, then we have simply returned the favor for the support we received from friends of liberty throughout the world.'' `` Anything new is fragile and I share the apprehension of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that on this bright new age of tolerance and freedom, the darkness may yet fall abruptly. It has happened in one country. ... We must remain prepared for that dark contingency, yet we must do everything prudent possible and prudent to encourage those who are working for change. `` In this desire for constructive change and movement toward democracy, we are one with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We look to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the natural leader in this great movement. She has ever been in the forefront of the modern struggle for both peace and freedom.'' Referring to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, she said, `` As a man who lived through war, he knows the price of peace; as I who lived through tyranny know the irreplaceable value of freedom.'' `` This sense of new possibilities must inform the future relations of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and guide the discussions we shall have. It is time for something new to happen in the world, and we are all so privileged to be a part of it.''

<TEXT>
 Islamic fundamentalists stunned pro-government candidates by taking 34 of the 80 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s first general election in 22 years, according to results reported Thursday. Fundamentalists rolled up huge totals in Wednesday's election while powerful former government officials struggled to win and sometimes failed. The outcome appeared a setback for King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, who urged voters not to mix religion with politics. It also was a disappointment to <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> women, who ran and voted in their first national election. None won of the 12 women among 647 parliamentary candidates won. Victors included men once imprisoned on political grounds and one convicted in an attack on an Israeli airline office in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. The new Parliament seems certain to be more assertive than the often passive legislature dissolved last year. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> retains ultimate power, however, and martial law in effect since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war continues. Parliament must approve all laws and can dismiss governments, but the king can dissolve the legislature and rule without it, as he has done for much of the past 15 years. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials, who regard <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> as a moderate <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leader, expressed some concern about the election results. One said, on condition of anonymity: `` What we are speaking about is a substantial opposition to the king from the right. ... This might bring a problem for the king.'' In the vanguard of the fundamentalist campaign was the Moslem Brotherhood. Its 26 declared and several allied candidates called for social justice, stricter Islamic morality and the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The people want Islam and it is not strange ... to have such a large number of Moslem candidates winning,'' Brotherhood spokesman <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghanimeh </PERSON> said. Fundamentalists often have allied themselves with <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, a descendant of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, against secular leftists, but have pressed him for restrictions on Western-type entertainment, more social welfare programs and greater separation of the sexes. Final results gave 22 seats to Brotherhood candidates. Other Islamists won 12 seats, and some of the 20 or so pro-government figures also had links to the Islamic movement. Leftists, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nationalists, tribal leaders and others took the rest of the seats. Parliament's makeup gives the varied opposition a clear majority over royalists. In their campaigns, many winners demanded prosecution of former officials accused of corruption and, because of the nation's $ 8.3 billion foreign debt, of economic mismanagement. The 80 seats are divided among 20 districts, and more than 40 candidates ran in some of them. Three men who resigned powerful posts to run barely made it. Former Deputy Premier <PERSON> Taher </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON> edged out a Brotherhood candidate in his <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> district but finished far behind the leader, another fundamentalist. <PERSON> Thouqan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hindawi </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, won a seat in <LOCATION> Irbid </LOCATION> but got only half as many votes as the top candidate, a member of the Brotherhood. <PERSON> Abdul-Raouf </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawabdeh </PERSON>, former mayor of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, finished eighth in the same race, just enough to win a place in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Those losing included <PERSON> Hamdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabaa </PERSON>, the former trade and industry minister, and the former public works minister, <PERSON> Shawfiq </PERSON> <PERSON> Zawaideh </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> applauded the renewal of the electoral process in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` We fully support the process of poliitcal reform that accompanies it. We note that the polling proceeeding peacefully and in a fair and orderly fashion,'' he said. He added that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> looks forward to working with the new government in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> once it is installed. After four days of price riots in southern <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in April, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> moved up the election date and increased personal and press freedom. Although political parties are banned, the government did not enforce the prohibition and many ran slates of candidates openly. One new member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> <PERSON> Murad </PERSON>, convicted in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> of participating in a 1969 attack on an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> El-Al </ORGANIZATION>, the Israeli airline, in which a Greek child was killed and 11 people were injured. Greek authorities freed <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> in 1970 in an exchange for 55 hostages on a hijacked Olympic Airways jetliner. The election formalized <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s separation from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which held half the seats in the parliament elected two months before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the territory in 1967. Last year, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> renounced <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s claims to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in favor the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.

 Hundreds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Bolivian agents raided 11 cocaine labs in eastern <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and arrested 25 people as drug trafficking suspects, police said Thursday. Six airplanes and eight helicopters on Wednesday ferried the agents to the cattle ranching town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION>, 250 miles northeast of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, where they arrested 17 people and raided and destroyed 11 clandestine laboratories for producing cocaine hydrochloride, police said. It was the biggest single sweep since a 3-month operation in 1986. Other raiders invaded dozens of homes and shops in the country's second most populous city, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, 355 miles east of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, and arrested eight people, including two Colombian chemists, police said About 350 members of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s U.S.-trained anti-narcotics force, called the Leopards, and 30 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents took part in the raids, police said. They appeared to signal an intensification of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s anti-drug efforts, in line with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recent call for an all-out international effort against narcotics trafficking `` The purpose of these raids is to dismantle <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s principal cocaine - producing operations,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrone </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> station chief for <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, after returning from the raid `` It is a new strategy and we are going right at the biggest organizations and they will have serious problems in the future.'' Two of those arrested in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION> were Argentines carrying automatic weapons and grenades, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> said. Dozens of other people were initially caught up in the sweeps but were cleared of suspicion and quickly released.

<HEAD>House Panel Warned Against Piecemeal Health-Care Reform</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hoping to move beyond <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s doomed catastrophic illness program, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on Thursday examined a series of proposals to rework the nation's health care system and avoid piecemeal reform. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, chairman of the private <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging that the nation's health-care delivery system is `` an absolute shambles'' that leaves many people unprotected and saddles others with huge costs. `` We have to make fundamental changes,'' said <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union. `` Patchwork will not do it.'' He said there is growing support for a national health insurance program, even among major employers who no longer can keep up with rising health-care costs. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, D-Calif., who himself has proposed a health-care reform package, said the hearing was designed to find solutions to `` the nation's cost, quality and access problems and for building an American health system. Up to 37 million Americans are uninsured and many more are underinsured, particularly against the staggering costs of long-term care, he said. <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON> cited the year-old <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic coverage program as an example of a piecemeal attempt to improve the health-care system. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is on the verge of scrapping all or part of the program after being inundated with complaints that its cost were too high and its benefits unneeded by some senior citizens. The blue-ribbon <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bipartisan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comprehensive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>, established as part of the catastrophic legislation, also is looking for answers to the problems of the uninsured and the costs of long-term care. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON>, chair of the <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, which also has been asked to examine the nation's health-care system, told the <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that determining who will pay for new health-care benefits is always the `` sticky wicket'' but that the government could do much more with what it already is spending <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>'s group is pushing a plan that would retain the Medicare program for the elderly and cover everyone else through a state-administered program financed perhaps through payroll taxes, private insurance premiums, alcohol and tobacco taxes and state sources. Another plan was advanced by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a former congressman who co-chairs the private <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>. The commission's plan would retain <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and private insurance programs and add a state-administered universal access plan for the uninsured, financed by fees paid by employers and people with income above 150 percent of poverty. `` Limited access, soaring costs and uncertain quality interact with the malpractice crisis to form a tightly woven web,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` We need to take the best features of this intricate design and weave them into a renewed system of health care.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> deputy minister of health, told the committee that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s national health insurance program is immensely popular at home, but success there `` does not mean that it is necessarily the answer for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' because of cultural differences.

 The infant boy born to a pregnant shooting victim died Thursday, two weeks after his mother was shot to death and his father wounded when they were held up outside a childbirth class. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> died at 4:34 p.m. at <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Woman's <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Cathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> She declined to release the cause of death. The <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner and officials at the district attorney's office were not immediately available for comment. `` Everybody in the city of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was really praying beyond hope that <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> would make it,'' <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said Thursday night. The baby had struggled for life in the hospital's neo-natal intensive care unit since his delivery by emergency Caesarian section hours after his mother was shot Oct. 23. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, 30, a lawyer who was seven months pregnant, was shot in the head by a gunman who held up the couple in their car after they left the hospital near the <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, 29, who managed to contact rescuers with his cellular car telephone, was shot in the abdomen and listed in stable condition Thursday at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, a spokesman said. At the father's request, family members declined Thursday night to comment on the infant's death. `` It's a very difficult time for all of us and we're just trying to follow <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON>'s wishes,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> DiMaiti </PERSON>. The attack on the <ORGANIZATION> Stuarts </ORGANIZATION>, who traveled from their suburban home to the city for its medical facilities, launched a city-wide search for the assailant, who was still at large Thursday night. `` There are n't words to describe the sadness and tragedy,'' <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. `` This horror struck in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on a city street and that's difficult for a hospital that values life so much.'' Residents in the <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> neighborhood where the attack took place expressed little hope this week that the gunman would be caught, but <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said Thursday that police were pursuing strong leads. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said he did n't know if prosecutors would attempt to bring double-murder charges if a suspect was arrested, `` but the senseless, tragic act resulted in the deaths of two innocent people, as far as I'm concerned.'' `` It hits home when you lose a little baby to the senseless violence that's taking place in our communities,'' the mayor said. `` We have to recommit ourselves in the memory of all people who have been innocent victims of violence to make the streets safe for everyone.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> castigated the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday for pressing ahead with plans for sanctions against <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, saying sanctions would `` cast a new shadow'' over Chinese-American ties. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Jinhua </PERSON> also singled out <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as being `` too deeply involved'' in the pro-democracy movement here last spring that was suppressed by Chinese troops. If sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are adopted, `` it will cast a new shadow over Chinese-U.S. relations and ... will hurt the feelings of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,'' she told a weekly news conference. Negotiators from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> agreed on Tuesday to stiffen proposed sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to protest the June crackdown. The measure asks two years of trade sanctions, including suspension of trade assistance; a halt to certain insurance for firms doing business in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and a freeze on exports of satellites, semimilitary items such as helicopters, and certain nuclear material and components. The bill condemns the `` unprovoked, brutal and indiscriminate assault'' on the protesters, which it said left at least 700 dead. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said about 300 people died. `` At present, Chinese-U.S. relations are in a period of great difficulties,'' Ms. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should not be held responsible for the difficulties. The reason for these difficulties is that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has gotten itself too deeply involved in the turmoil and rebellion that happened not too long ago in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> insists the protests were whipped up by `` counterrevolutionaries'' seeking to overthrow the communist regime, and says foreign forces supported the uprising. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> also told visiting former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> last week that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` too deeply involved'' in the demonstrations, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was `` the real victim'' of the events at the time. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government rejects the charges. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said this month that the protests `` were clearly the result of domestic developments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action against <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> because of its persistence in hunting whales has been indefinitely postponed, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Boatright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s spokesman, said a decision had been due next Monday on whether <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> was violating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law by interfering with the ban of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on commercial whaling. He said there would now be negotiations with <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s new government, headed by Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Syse </PERSON>. The Norwegian Labor government ousted last month allowed the taking of 17 whales this year, which it said were for scientific research. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conservationists, who campaign against all whaling, say that Norwegian whalers used to take about 2,000 a year and that 17 are not enough for any scientific or commercial purpose. <PERSON> Syse </PERSON>'s trade minister, <PERSON> Kaci </PERSON> <PERSON> Kullmann </PERSON> <PERSON> Five </PERSON>, had a meeting with <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> on Thursday. Afterwards, she said <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> would take five whales next year. `` There will not be any certification on Nov. 13,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Five </PERSON> said in an interview. `` No date has been set.'' She said she expected `` positive developments'' in future talks. <PERSON> Boatright </PERSON> would not say if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed with Mrs. Five on further whaling. He said that after negotiations with <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> will make a recommendation to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> certifies that <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> is interfering with the international ban, he may restrict or even halt Norwegian shipments of fish to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, senior scientist at the World Wildlife Fund, predicted a strong reaction from conservationists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who campaign vigorously to end all whaling. `` The conservation community will be jumping all over the administration if it agrees to that,'' he said, referring to the Norwegian insistence on continued whaling. `` The Norwegians are the only ones doing any whaling except the Japanese. This would prevent the Japanese from being isolated.'' Conservationists say the Japanese take about 300 whales a year, also for what they say are scientific purposes.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, frustrated by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> delays on its nominations, may give some of its 119 languishing nominees `` recess appointments'' not requiring <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action, White House officials said Thursday. Such a parlimentary end run around the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s advice-and-consent powers would surely anger Democatic leaders and worsen already-strained relations between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> White House personnel director <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> said he was preparing recommendations for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the procedures for making a possible batch of recess appointments during <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' upcoming year-end break. `` I've done it on my own without the direction of the president or the chief of staff -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>. However, he added, `` I've not been told to stop.'' <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> said there were 119 presidential appointments pending as of late Thursday. Another White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, `` We're not anxious to do this. This is only a last resort. But it is something we may be compelled to do,'' said a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Under the Constitution, the president can temporarily sidestep the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s confirmation powers by appointing a person to fill a vacancy while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is in recess. The provision was put into the Constitution to enable the government to continue to function when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> took long recesses _ sometimes, in the early days of the Republic, for months at a time. Someone granted such a `` recess appointment'' may serve, under the Constitution, until the end of the next session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Were <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint someone during the upcoming yearend recess, that individual could keep the job at least until the end of 1990 without the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> having a say. Nearly all presidents have made recess appointments from time to time. And it is a favored tactic for giving political supporters short-term jobs like ambassadorships near the end of a presidential term. However, the device has never been used in a wholesale fashion before. `` The president really has n't wanted to resort to this. But neither did he realize that some many of his nominees would n't be acted on this late on,'' said a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Such a move has high political risks and would escalate the battle between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. Up until now, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself has not advocated such a drastic step, White House sources said. But senior advisers might urge him to take such a course in an effort to break the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> logjam, the sources said. <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>'s work on the question first was reported in Thursday editions of The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. Among the pending nominations are <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Everitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON> as urban mass transportation administrator, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> as assistant secretary of commerce and a host of ambassadorial and judicial appointments. Some of the delayed nominations have been controversial. For instance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> for a top <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post has drawn opposition from environmentalists and many senators for what they allege to be a pro-development bias. And some ambassadorial appointments have been blocked by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats who claim they have few qualifications other than large contributions to Republican campaigns. In fact, on Thursday, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md., vowing to end an `` ambassadorial spoils system,'' sought to kill <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> as ambassador to ` There are no qualifications for this lady. There's nothing there,'' <PERSON> Sarbannes </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The nomination of <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to be assistant secretary of energy for defense programs has been stalled since July over criticism of his record at the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. And the nomination of <PERSON> Vaugh </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> to be a federal judge in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has been snarled in neoptism charge. He is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cousin. At a news conference on Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused the Democratic-led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of `` blocking everything I do'' and has often vented his frustration at the slow pace of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consideration of his nominees. And Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> earlier accused the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of holding up dozens of presidential appointments `` for artificial reasons.'' At the same time, however, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> has accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of foot-dragging on other key government positions. The <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> recently that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had failed to `` make nominations for nearly half'' of the key executive branch jobs and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s criticism was `` unfounded and unfair.'' Many of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ambassadorial nominations have been delayed in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ where <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders have accused the president of seeking to fill many of the posts with political supporters rather than experienced diplomats. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does choose to make recess appointments, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> loses its power to deny the individual the post for more than a year. But there are other ways that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can make its will felt. `` If the recess appointee wanted to get paid, it might be a problem,'' said an official in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> parlimentarian's office, who spoke on the condition of anoymity.

 Major airlines officials are raising strong objections to congressional moves to reimpose government control over their industry.

Calling for even stronger action, Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, introduced the Airline Reregulation Act that would allow the government once again to regulate fares, routes, and services. The industry was deregulated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1978. `` I do n't know if complete reregulation is the answer,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said. `` But I do know it's time we owned up to the fact that airline deregulation was a mistake.''

 Trucks and railcars are hauling garbage into <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s breadbasket and then carrying food on the way back with little or no cleaning in between, according to testimony on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Witnesses told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel of trucks that carry meat and solid waste on alternate trips, trailers that haul food along with insects left from garbage runs and diesel fuel from one shipment seeping into flour in the next cargo. `` Would you like your bacon and eggs delivered on any of these trucks?'' Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, asked the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials on Wednesday.

 Only President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promised signature is needed for the first minimum wage increase in nearly a decade, following <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' lopsided approval of a bill raising the rate to $ 4.25 by April 1991. The measure _ which includes a subminimum wage for teen-agers new to the job market _ cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on an 89-8 vote Wednesday, exactly a week after it passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by an equally overwhelming vote of 382-37. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who struck the compromise plan with congressional Democrats last week, is expected to sign the bill before Thanksgiving, perhaps as early as next week. `` The nine-year logjam on the minimum wage is finally broken,'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote `` The working poor are about to receive an increase, although it is not as much as they deserve.''

<TEXT>
 This is ratings `` sweeps'' time, and you face considerable Nielsen-boosting sex, violence, and bad manners on TV. But there are occasional respites, and a nice one for the family lies ahead on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> Sunday night. It's `` Polly,'' an updated adaptation, with music and a black cast, of `` Pollyanna,'' the 1960 Disney movie that was so goshdarn positive it made the Up With People singers seem the Grumble Chorale. This two-hour TV version, which dips into `` The Cosby Show'' cast for its button-cute star, <PERSON> Keshia </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON> as <PERSON> Polly </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Phylicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashad </PERSON> as her stern spinster aunt, suffers from a similar case of sugary. Still, it's oddly refreshing to see such unabashed innocence and good will on prime-time TV, if only as an antidote to all the `` fact-based'' TV movies that air later and are mostly routine salutes to grim. This `` Polly,'' written by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Blinn </PERSON> and directed and choreographed by <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, former colleagues in TV's `` Fame,'' is a gentle tale that through its young star slips in a plea for racial harmony. Set in 1955, in times of racial segregation, it takes place in the mythical, tidy, all-black <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Harrington </LOCATION>, a hamlet run and virtually owned by <PERSON> Polly </PERSON>'s lovely, no-nonsense aunt. The aunt played by <PERSON> Rashad </PERSON> _ who in real life is <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s sister _ believes that life is a very serious matter. Woe betide anyone, even the town preacher -LRB- <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> -RRB-, heard making a joyful noise. All this starts changing when young <PERSON> Polly </PERSON>, left an orphan by a car crash that killed her parents, arrives from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to live with her aunt, and quickly becomes best friends with a local orphan boy -LRB- <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> -RRB-. Young <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> is a small ray of sunshine whose faith in humanity, regardless of race, is unshakeable. She brings out the good in everyone. But of course that proves a turning point when she befriends a rich, frowsy old white woman -LRB- <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> <PERSON> Holm </PERSON> -RRB- who, as the Caucasian counterpart of <PERSON> Polly </PERSON>'s aunt, runs and virtually owns a nearby all-white town. Such predictability can be overcome with a good script. Problem is, <ORGANIZATION> Blinn </ORGANIZATION>, normally a fine writer, has sort of a tame teleplay here. Instead of showing the world through the child's shiny brown eyes, the script is littered with distracting subplots, including the love of a young music professor -LRB- <PERSON> Dorian </PERSON> <PERSON> Harewood </PERSON> -RRB- for <PERSON> Polly </PERSON>'s aunt Worse, a supposedly mean old man -LRB- <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> -RRB- the kids encounter has a kindly twinkle in his eyes. A mean old man is n't supposed to have such a twinkle, only a soul of garlic A little more grittiness, less pasteurization, and more sharply drawn characters would have greatly helped this show. But it's enjoyable, anyway, for two reasons One is the fine cast, most of whose members have stage backgrounds. You only wish the script had offered them more. The other is the music, particularly <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>'s tasty orchestrations of the gentle ballads or rollicking gospel songs. With two first-rate dance numbers as part of the show, the tunes help propel `` Polly.'' They also make you wish this were a full-fledged musical, not a story with music. It's a little frustrating. As in `` Tap,'' which had the potential to be a great dance movie, most musical numbers in `` Polly'' end too quickly and seem unwisely abbreviated. Oh, well. `` Polly'' is a good family show, and cheers to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> for commissioning it. A warning: shoo your tykes away when it ends. For all will return to normal sweeps-month routine then, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will air its grim `` Manhunt: Search for the Night Stalker.'' It is a TV movie based on the true story of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, the satanic `` Night Stalker'' of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> who butchered or raped more than a dozen people during a deadly spree in 1985. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, convicted of 13 murders, was sentenced to death on Tuesday.

 Elsewhere in television ... THE GREAT AUDIENCE QUESTION _ For those who want to know if <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` PrimeTime Live'' is going to dispense with its studio audience, the answer from ABC News President <PERSON> Roone </PERSON> <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON> is probably yes _ but not every week. He says the studio audience was made part of the program's format `` because we were going to do a lot of Town Meeting-type segments,'' but that has n't often happened Now, he says, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> executivies are pondering whether to have a studio audience only on those weeks they feel the program needs it. `` We're in the process of deciding that right now,'' he says. THE REAL AND THE RE-CREATED AT CBS NEWS: Thursday's scheduled `` 48 Hours'' program on teen sex included excerpts of a girl telling a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> hearing that she had an abortion without parental consent. Tomorrow, `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung'' re-creates what a <LOCATION> Massachusett </LOCATION> teen-ager went through _ including counseling and legal advice _ when seeking an abortion without her parents' consent.

<HEAD>Weaker Corporate Profits Were No Surprise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 You have to wonder about the stock market as an economic forecaster if what they're saying is true: that the recent market slump has its origins in corporate profit weakness. Why? Because the slowing in the growth rate of profits has been going on for a long time, and with so pronounced a trend that no informed investor could have been surprised. The red flags were flying high. Even ordinary workaday consumers, those without any particular knowledge or even interest in corporate profits, must have known, because it was their stubborness that forced sellers to compete with lower prices. In 1988, based on the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's composite index, corporate profits showed a 36 percent increase. In this year's first quarter the rate was down to 22 percent, year over year In the second quarter it was under 10 percent. Aerospace, apparel, automotive, electrical, metal and oil and gas companies have been strained. Record profits for the automotive companies are a matter of history now. In electronics, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> suffered sharp reversals. Theoretically, the stock market sees ahead at least six months, but in this instance the professionals allegedly were surprised by events that began at least six months ago and which are likely to continue for months more. The economy is sluggish. Consumers are watching dollar and credit balances. Reports show they are not losing their buying confidence, but instead are sharpening their perspective on prices. They are forcing price cuts. The signs are all about. <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> says it is ready to match competitor discounts. Instead of almost constant sales, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> is promoting `` everyday low pricing.'' McDonald's and other fast-food outlets are finding that customers sometimes prefer to buy frozen foods and microwave them at home. Everyone is aware by now that the car companies are in a fix, and are willing to talk deals. Knowing this, customers are driving more hard bargains than new cars. And in some parts of the computer market it's the same way. Such behavior is an extreme contrast to the inflationary situation that existed through much of the 1970s, when customers competed to buy and thereby forced up prices _ which in turn caused other buyers to stampede before prices went even higher. In that case, the consumer lost on every deal. In today's marketplace, competition is among sellers rather than customers, and customers are winning on almost every deal. After one of the longest economic expansions ever, millions of Americans have bought all the luxuries they need. Anything additional is optional. If they see a bargain they might buy, but they are ready to do without too. Meanwhile, many companies are involved in a marketplace brawl that has little to do directly with consumers _ except to put them in an even better bargaining position. Such companies are fighting to retain market position, the better to greet the eventual upturn. They are reluctant to cut production sharply; instead, they maintain high production and sell at low or no profit. Holding market position can be extremely costly, of course, but a lot of companies today are like breakfast cereal companies, forced to hold onto their shelf position because if they do n't they might never get it back. Such a position is a rare one for the consumer because it has the added benefit of forcing lower both inflation and interest rates. And in the long run the harsh competition might be good for producers too. In the meantime, however, it is n't very good for corporate profits, and everyone seemed to have sensed it except the so-called professional stock traders, who should have been watching that signal most closely of all.

 In the home of producer <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, near <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, are crates containing more than 10,000 records. In midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, the location of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Shakedown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Studio </LOCATION>, nearly as many musicians have passed through. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> are but a few of the artists with whom <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has worked, remixing songs or producing albums. Rappers, rockers, crooners and funksters have all gotten a boost from <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s studio expertise and pounding drum sound that's best described by the Hall and <PERSON> Oates </PERSON> album he produced, `` Big Bam Boom.'' Disappearing behind the control board does n't appeal to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. Emotional, hard-headed and opinionated, he believes in the producer as collaborator, even star. `` The producers who turned me on were -LRB- <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> -RRB- Gamble and -LRB- Leon -RRB- <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> and all those <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> guys,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in a recent interview at Shakedown. `` <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitfield </PERSON> of Motown was a big influence. All those producers made producer-oriented music. The producers would write the songs, arrange them and do the whole thing. That's what I aspire to be.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has no catch phrase like <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Spector </PERSON>'s `` Wall of Sound'' or Motown's `` Sound of <LOCATION> Young </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' If anything, the producer sees walls as something to be broken down, not constructed. That's why he calls his new record `` Merge. `` My album is representative of the music I like,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` If you come out to my house and see my records, you know my influences. This album is the merging of lots of different music. `` What I focused on was writing really good songs and making an album that I found listenable and enjoyable. The next album I'd like to combine some different elements and make new music. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, Tiny Valentine and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> are featured singers. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s soaring vocals carry the album's first single, `` The Message Is Love,'' but the song took months to record. `` We first did a reading and then he sang it through and it was really good,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` He said, ` OK, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> ai n't going to sing it much better than that ...' But he did n't get the melody, he rewrote it. `` He goes back and sings the medody but it's horrible. I ask him, ` Do you think we can get the other <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>?' He sang it again and it was great. Then I had to do some more over-dubbing. We ended up doing two takes in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and four in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>.'' Conflicts in the studio do n't faze <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who has seen them from all angles, settling creative differences and causing some, too. Cocaine was a problem, he admits, and nearly ruined his career after a run of hit records in the mid-1980s. He's counting on `` Merge'' to bring him back. `` The only way I cn do anything is to go in and write songs. I had a bad reputation. People were saying I was difficult. But I helped create things like multiple edits and songs without bass lines. I think I can be innovative again.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> native, made his breakthrough in 1981 with <PERSON> Africa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bambaata </PERSON>'s `` Planet Rock,'' an early rap record. He was soon one of the industry's hottest producers and remixers, asked to edit extended versions of songs from <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s `` Born in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'' album. <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oates </PERSON> also wanted his services. In 1985, he helped produce the `` <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'' record, assembling a remarkable collection of musicians _ including <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, U2's <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Blades </PERSON> _ to perform material attacking <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid system. In a studio crammed with stars, no one was revered more than the reclusive <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who glided past an awestruck <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Raitt </PERSON> and contributed a horn part to a jazz track that appeared on the album. `` We asked Miles if it was OK to have a guy in the studio with a video camera,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> recalled. `` He starts playing and while he's playing, he goes, ` You ca n't come in here, you're the wrong color. I thought he was talking to the video guy, who's white. `` Then he says, ` This ai n't your country,' and we realized what he was doing. We stopped and said that was great and asked if he would mind doing something like that again.'' But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also has unhappy memories of drunken sessions with <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, feuds with <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oates </PERSON>, and drawn out legal battles with New Edition that he said contributed to his drug problems. Now, he's hoping to produce work that equals his best material and will stick around as long as the blues records that fill his home.

 In <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> hallways in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and 50th floor trading rooms above Wall Street, it is remembered simply as Boesky Day. On Nov. 14, 1986, six months after arresting a pudgy investment banker named <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> for insider trading, prosecutors announced they had landed their biggest fish, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. He stole $ 50 million through sleazy trades. He schemed to conceal ownership of stocks and duped investors. He spun a web of skulduggery that included junk-bond giant <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its master financier, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. `` If my mistakes launch a process of re-examination of the rules and practices of our financial marketplace, then perhaps some good will result,'' <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> said after paying $ 100 million in fines and restitution and agreeing to plead guilty to one criminal charge. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s wish has come true. In the three years since Boesky Day, Wall Street has drastically changed the way it does business. The insider trading scandal has been a dominant theme in a decade when investment firms grew fat on multibillion-dollar takeover deals and rewarded baby-faced college graduates with six-figure salaries. For some, fraud and greed were a byproduct of success. For the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, prosecuting well-dressed criminals created a battle subculture reminiscent of <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> in Prohibition-era <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Criminal and civil prosecutions unprecedented in the history of the nation's financial markets snared violators from a 24-year-old junior analyst to a 63-year-old magazine editor. Watching the scandal unfold was like watching a movie, and it became the breeding ground for cinema, books and television. When police handcuffed a broker on a trading floor in the 1987 film `` Wall Street,'' it resembled a day in February 1987 when prosecutors seized a veteran trader at venerable <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> while disbelieving colleagues watched. The incident proved an embarrassment for prosecutors, however, when they had to drop the case against the trader for lack of evidence. The scandal also became the testing ground for aggressive use of the criminal racketeering law dubbed RICO, previously reserved for <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> thugs and drug lords, to prosecute investment bankers in <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> suits. Prosecutors used the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law to force <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> into a deal it could n't refuse: Plead guilty to securities felonies or face severe fines and a potentially embarrassing trial. Perhaps most significant, the scandal forced Wall Street to reassess and reform in a decade of unbridled paper wealth built on a mix of youth, money, ambition and myopia. `` I was so focused on my career and getting ahead that I really lost touch with reality, lost perspective,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, now 36, told business students in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this summer. Since <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>'s arrest, more than 30 people and three companies either have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a range of financial crimes in cases brought by the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. The crackdown led to a vastly expanded use of criminal securities laws to include stock manipulation and disguising securities ownership, behavior previously handled by the civil courts. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Wharton </PERSON> MBA who pioneered <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s domination of high-yield securities known as `` junk bonds,'' has been indicted under RICO for dealings with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. Prison terms have climbed, to four years for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> takeover specialist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, convicted in June. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> is up for release in April from a three-year term at a minimum-security prison in <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> was paroled in September 1988 after serving 17 months of a two-year term `` There's not a lot of sympathy for guys who make $ 500 million a year cheating,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> securities lawyer who represents <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. `` Judges have become a lot tougher.'' Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> orchestrated the corruption crackdown and used it as a springboard for an unsuccessful bid for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> mayor. The securities unit of the federal prosecutor's office has grown to 20 people from three in 1986. `` They've overindicted and indicted for conduct which should not be charged as criminal,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer who has defended several Wall Street figures targeted by <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. `` I think when you rape, rob, pillage, extort, these things have an inherent kind of evil to them _ far more than an inappropriate tax straddle or a conflict between a lawful and an unlawful rumor,'' <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> said. On Wall Street, the insider trading scandal has changed the way business is transacted. Arbitragers who speculate in stocks of potential takeover targets and the investment bankers who finance the deals say the days of careless information-swapping are gone. `` Bankers just wo n't pick up calls from arbitragers. They just screen them out,'' said a 27-year-old investment banker at a major Wall Street firm who spoke on condition he not be identified. Market participants say they have seen a decline in long runups in the stock price of takeover targets before a deal is announced, possibly indicating less information is leaked in advance. Investment firms have increased the number of compliance officers monitoring trades and spent millions on new technology. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has boosted its market surveillance staff to 109 from 85 in 1986. `` Taking the action against <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, taking the action against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has put the Street back on an even keel,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> enforcement director who helped spearhead the major insider trading cases and is now a private attorney in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Investment firms have hired lawyers who wield significant policy-making power. Firms have rewritten rules and added ethics lectures to training programs. Many brokerages now require employees to clear personal stock transactions in advance to avoid any possible suggestion of wrongdoing. For those on their way to Wall Street, top business schools including <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> have added required ethics courses. `` I certainly think it heightened the awareness of Wall Street for the potential for disaster if business is n't being conducted in the right way,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, head of mergers and acquisitions for <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Kidder closed its arbitrage department after paying $ 25.3 million to settle civil insider trading charges stemming from the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> scandal `` There was an ` it ca n't happpen here' attitude before that,'' said <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>'s general counsel, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Liftin </PERSON>. `` To find there was a willful violator in the middle of things was a real shock to everybody.'' The scandal has produced drama ranging from courtroom face-offs to an alleged plot to kill <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> pleaded innocent, hundreds of reporters and spectators jammed <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> loyalists sported hats reading `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> We Believe in You'' and cheered their hero. When speculator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> feared he was about to be implicated, he loaded an assault rifle with the intent of shooting <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, police said. He was seized en route. <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> since has been indicted for securities fraud. He still faces weapons possession charges. The highest drama, however, may be yet to come, a courtroom confrontation featuring high-priced <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> grilling <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> on the witness stand at <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s trial, set for next year.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> laid out a pitifully thin welcome mat when <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> arrived at <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>'s Capitol Square nearly 20 years ago. Even so, in the minds of some reluctant colleagues that day, he promptly tripped over it. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, then the only black elected to the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> since Reconstruction, had barely taken his oath when he implored replacement of the official state song, noting its lyrics extol plantation life under `` old <PERSON> Massa </PERSON>'' and refer to the commonwealth as `` where this old darkie's heart am longed to go.'' `` The words burned in my ears,'' said <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>. His words, in turn, burned the ears of his white brethren. He was the only member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> who was not invited that year to the annual bash for legislators at the exclusive <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, where he had once worked as a busboy. Some things have n't changed in the Old Dominion in the two decades since. `` Carry Me Back to <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'' is still the state song, though rarely sung. But <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> wo n't find the footing nearly so cruel in January when, barring an unexpected change in last Tuesday's vote count, he will take his next oath at the state capitol. The finest red carpet will be out for the new governor. Preliminary vote totals show that <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, a 58-year-old Democrat, beat <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a white Republican, by the thread-thin margin of 5,000 votes. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has said he will demand a recount. Assuming it confirms <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> as the winner, he will be the first elected black governor in the history of the Republic. It would be naive to suggest that some people did n't vote for or against <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> on the basis of race. But the marvelous thing is that no one in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, a state ruled by segregationists a generation ago, made race an issue in this campaign _ nasty as it was on other fronts. Political analysts will have a field day postulating how <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> became the first state to elect a black governor _ not <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> came whisker-close in 1982, then faded in 1986, and not <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where Republican <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> also lost in 1986. Pro-choice abortion activists, who campaigned hard for <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> with newfound voice and financial muscle, will trumpet his victory as evidence of a shifting political tide. So will black activists and national Democratic leaders still smarting from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> landslides. But any simplistic explanation simply will not do, for that would ignore <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s ground-breaking achievements on a long, patient climb to power over two decades _ not to mention the remarkable social and political metamorphosis of the entire state. The Old Dominion, it is sometimes said, is now the New Dominion. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> has been a relentless, leave-nothing-to-chance campaigner, and it could be argued that 1985, the year he won the lieutenant governorship, marked his most important political passage. White party leaders had pleaded with him to withdraw from the race, lest he sink the ticket headed by <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, the governor he now succeeds. Instead, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> began a 3,719-mile auto tour of the state, handshaking his way through 338 cities and towns and all 95 of the state's counties. Two-thirds of his $ 750,000 war chest that year was spent on television ads, including one in which a beefy white policeman from a small <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> town delivered the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> won with 51.8 percent of the vote. He raised 10 times as much money for this year's governor's race, which was a sweat-soaked reprise of 1985 He retraced his path into virtually every country store, cafe and town hall. Some advised him to stay out of remote, all-white regions. `` People said I should never go out there with those people because I'd never be seen again,'' he recalled. `` I go out there to those people, and they say ` Welcome home, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>.''' In <LOCATION> Farmville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> renewed acquaintances with townspeople beneath their monument to Confederate heroes and was led around by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, a white attorney who has never lived anywhere else. As <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> put it: `` Folks are going to vote for him, but they are n't going to talk about it They are n't going to put a Wilder bumper sticker on the truck.'' That suited <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> fine. His record is one of living within the establishment while selectively challenging it, knowing when to threaten, when to charm. He was never a street activist for civil rights. He did not support <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 or 1988, and spurned offers from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and other black activists to campaign for him. To those who think he has been too accommodating to the white majority, he had a standard rejoinder: `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> runs to inspire. I run to win.'' It may not have seemed that way in the beginning. He arrived at the Legislature, already having risen from busboy to millionaire criminal lawyer, wearing an Afro, and there was the early brouhaha over the state song. Over time, the Afro gave way to a straighter silver mane, his flamboyant attire to banker's suits. `` Someone said to me in 1985 that when he saw me wearing wingtips, he knew I was really serious,'' he said. By then, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was a committee chairman and one of the most influential senators in the Legislature. He shepherded an array of anti-discrimination laws and won a long battle to declare a holiday honoring King _ although whites insisted that the day be shared with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stonewall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s rise, after all, took place in the city that once served as the capital of the Confederacy, in a state that was dominated for four decades by the segregationist political machine of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> Sr.. A poll tax kept blacks effectively disenfranchised until the mid-1960s, when the 24th Amendment to the Constitution and the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 forced the state to change

 Yat-Pang Au enrolled at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> this semester after a two-year battle against a school admissions policy that he said discriminated against Asian-Americans. His case has drawn new attention to affirmative action programs designed to help minorities enter top colleges and universities _ because in some cases they have hampered rather than helped this minority, which scholastically outperforms the general population. Au graduated at the top of his high school class and received awards for 10 extracurricular activities. But his initial application to <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> was rejected two years ago, his father said, because of an affirmative action policy that put a 40 percent limit on admissions based strictly on grades and test scores. In a single year, the number of Asian-Americans accepted as freshmen at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> dropped from 24 percent to 21 percent amid cries of racism. `` I fight this not because it's my son but for <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> people as a whole,'' said Au's father, <PERSON> Sik </PERSON> <PERSON> Kee </PERSON> <PERSON> Au </PERSON>, a businessman in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` One of the most important things in life for us is an education.'' The university has since revised its admissions policy, and the younger Au enrolled there as a transfer student this semester as a junior. His younger brother <PERSON> Yat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hon </PERSON> was admitted as a freshman. University officials say the new admissions policy maintains high academic standards while reflecting the state's diverse population, helping blacks, Hispanics and other low-achieving groups. It has placated the once-angry Asian-American community, but Rep. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., wants more <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON> is sponsoring a resolution that would put <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on record as opposing quotas that appear to discriminate against Asian-Americans. `` I believe that the issue here is not affirmative action but one of equal opportunity for all students,'' said <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON> in a recent letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> in Higher Education. `` Quotas and other forms of racial discrimination have no place in our nation's schools and for that matter anywhere else.'' University officials said the proposed resolution may hamper efforts by colleges and universities to enroll more minorities. `` It would appear that Mr. <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON> is using this resolution as a way to get at affirmative action, which we obviously would totally disagree with,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON>, assistant chancellor for public affairs. Most colleges and universities across the nation are seeking ways to increase minority enrollment to prepare for demographic projections that minorities collectively will become the majority by the year 2000. Enrollment of minority undergraduate students this fall at <ORGANIZATION> Bowling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> increased 13.2 percent over last year. Blacks account for 4 percent with 636, Hispanics make up about 1 percent with 140, and other minorities, primarily Asians, have gone from 96 to 118 of the 15,978 undergraduate students. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, minority student enrollment increased by 9.3 percent this year, from 4,991 to 5,454, a record total. Officials said Asians comprise 6.8 percent of the student body -LRB- after an Asian enrollment increase of 11.1 percent -RRB-, blacks 6.5 percent, Hispanics 2.8 percent and American Indians 0.4 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> said that in 1986, colleges enrolled 90,000 American Indians, 448,000 Asians, 624,000 Hispanics, 1.1 million blacks, 9.9 million whites and 344,000 foreign students. The schools also have instituted special programs to recruit and retain minorities. <ORGANIZATION> UC-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> officials insist their new admissions policy merely reflects the state's population, while upholding high academic standards. The school receives about 22,000 applications for 4,000 spaces. <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON> said that since 1980, the state's population has increased 500,000 a year and that between now and the year 2000, there will be an additional 6 million residents, mostly minority _ Hispanic and Asians particularly. The <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> population has grown a phenomenal 70 percent since 1980 and now approaches 10 percent of the state's total. Statistics show that Asian-Americans at <ORGANIZATION> UC-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> had the highest graduation rates, nearly 95 percent in 1987, compared with 93 percent for whites. Other minorities, including blacks and Hispanics, had graduation rates in the low - to mid-80s By 1991, <ORGANIZATION> UC-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> will admit 50 percent of its students based on grades and test scores alone. Currently, 40 percent are in this academic category. About 45 percent of the fall freshman admissions will be based on criteria other than academic scores alone. The other criteria will include race, disability and special talents, such as in music, drama and debating. A third category will include athletes, the poor, regardless of race or ethnicity, and older or re-entering students. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>, who works with admissions at the university, stressed that all applicants still fall within the top 12.5 percent of high school seniors. `` Some people mistakenly think that our commitment to diversify our student body has come at the expense of our academic standards. That's simply false,'' said <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>. `` We are doing now exactly what we've done for the past 50 years, selecting from the top.'' The elder Au said that before the recent changes, `` it was very clear'' <ORGANIZATION> UC-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> `` had unfair practices for admissions.'' `` But they are now gradually working to change that. I hope this is the beginning of opportunity.''

<HEAD>Issues and Tactics of '89 Elections Could Spill Over Into 1990 Races</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Republicans already were having an off off-year, and they knew there was worse coming. So they had an alibi ready when Democrats swept the season's big three elections in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The outcomes ran to form, although the margins for a black governor in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and mayor-elect in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were narrower than the pollsters anticipated. The Republican refrain was a tested and familiar one _ that these losses were local, not portents of the national elections of 1990. But the hangover remedy did n't work this time. Republican National Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> acknowledged as much, even as he tried to play down the losses. These scattered elections had too much in common, in issues, themes and tactics that could echo into next year's national campaign for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and 36 governorships. Earlier in the year, <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had won five out of seven special elections to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>; their majority will be 259 to 176 heading into national mid-term elections in which the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> party historically has lost seats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The 1990 elections also will shape the state governments that will control the process of reapportioning congressional seats after the census, another worrisome prospect for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. It takes a governor or control in at least one branch of the state legislature to put a party in a bargaining position on reapportionment. Republicans will control none of the above in the two state governments shaped by Tuesday's balloting. Democratic Govs.-elect <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> _ who still faces a recount _ will be working with solidly <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> legislatures. `` Take a look at what happened to underpin reapportionment for 1992,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said it would be a mistake to read national patterns into local elections, but there were some: _ The abortion issue boomeranged on Republicans, who once had seen it work against Democratic candidates President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and Republican congressional leaders discussed it at a Wednesday political post mortem. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in advance that he was not budging in his own anti-abortion stance, enforced with two vetoes this fall. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> was quoted as saying that if abortion becomes the main issue in the 1990 campaign, Republicans will lose. The Republican losers in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> all were abortion foes, although each had tempered that opposition. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s campaign advertisements stressed the issue, saying he would veto any attempt to take away a woman's right to choose. In the closest of counts, that almost certainly gained him votes crucial to his victory margin. Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> whip, said extreme positions for or against abortion can only hurt candidates, but that there is a common sense position in the middle. The Republican problem is that when their 1989 candidates tried to move there, Democrats hammered successfully at their old, absolutist positions, while anti-abortion groups denounced them for trying to change. Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had dug himself and his party into a hole on the issue. But the Democrats are n't home free, either. The official party position is in favor of unrestricted abortion rights, but <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that should not be a litmus test for their candidates. `` We do n't want to run Democrats away from the party because they wo n't favor the platform line on this issue,'' he said _ Campaigns were tough, negative and sometimes personal, with candidates and their advertisements concentrating on tearing down the opposition It is a proven tactic; President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used it in 1988. While Democratic leaders criticized that style of campaigning and claimed the 1989 outcome would end it, Democratic winners used it as aggressively as Republicans. `` Maybe I can have a role in seeing that it gets a little more positive,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday. How? `` Well, say I think it ought to be a little more positive.'' The argument now and probably next year is about who throws the first stone, with each side blaming the other for negativism as both sides go at it. While <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the voters are fed up with negative politics he also said Democrats `` do n't believe in unilateral disarmament.'' _ <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> became the first black elected governor, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> the first black mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, although by unexpectedly narrow margins Both ran as centrists; neither was vulnerable to the tax-and-spend, soft-on-crime labels Republicans attached to the Democratic ticket in 1988. Black Democrats were elected to succeed white mayors in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. Even the losing Republicans applauded the trend there and elsewhere; <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said the black victories were fundamentally good for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> could point only to a handful of down-the-ballot victories as evidence of success for black Republican candidates. And <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said Republicans still tend to send black candidates on `` suicide missions,'' running them against heavily favored Democratic officeholders. He said the <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> victories will help the Democrats attract black candidates and solidify black support. There will be at least one major bid for another black breakthrough next year. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> is preparing to run for governor of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in 1990. He'll seek the Democratic nomination on what is likely to be a crowded ballot. If he won, two of 50 governors would be black. There are no black senators, 24 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members. And <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> sees no prospect that those numbers will change significantly next year. `` I do n't know where there would be any major advances in 1990.''

 Seven-year-old <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coles </PERSON> no longer cringes when he goes to the doctor, and neither does his mother, thanks to a program that provides free health care to children of the working poor. <PERSON> Justin </PERSON>'s parents earn $ 13,000 a year, too much to qualify for state Medicaid yet well below the federal poverty level for a family of five. Because the <PERSON> Coles </PERSON> fall through this ever-widening crack, <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> receives treatment for recurring ear infections through the Caring Program for Children. Before he was enrolled in 1986, `` We were relying on clinics. If it would have been just your typical childhood illnesses I could deal with that but with permanent hearing loss ...'' said his mother, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, her voice trailing off. `` He's very happy because he can see his doctor now. There was that period of time when he was running from doctor to doctor and clinic to clinic. `` The bottom line for him is it saved his hearing. I'm convinced of this.'' The program, sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION>, has helped more than 13,000 youngsters in four years. About 700 more are waiting to get in. Its success has prompted nine states to start similar programs, and four more are expected to follow suit soon. For <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Coles </PERSON>, the Caring Program has removed the stigma of being on welfare while letting them provide for their son. His ID card resembles any insurance card, and is accepted by most physicians. Mrs. <PERSON> Coles </PERSON>, 38, who has two children from a previous marriage, works part time as a nurse's aide. Her husband, 37, a laid-off steelworker, paints houses. `` We are the working poor. It's unfortunate, but we're not alone,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Coles </PERSON> said. `` You have to make a choice. What's more important to my child? His ears or having food on the table and a roof over his head? That is absolutely what it came down to.'' No one should have to make that kind of choice, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, host of public television's `` Mister <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' Neighborhood'' and Caring Program honorary chairman. The program `` is not going to solve all of the ills of our society, with its skyrocketing medical expenses. But it certainly is a stopgap.'' The Coles are among 37 million Americans the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> says lack health insurance. About a third, or 12.5 million, are under 19. From 1980 to 1988, the number of children under 15 living in poverty rose by 1.2 million, according to the Children's Defense Fund. `` We have a national problem,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Strain </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION>. `` The very poor people have access to care'' through the government, <PERSON> Strain </PERSON> said. `` The children who have trouble are those above the level that makes them eligible for Medicaid and children who should be eligible but are n't.'' The federal poverty level for a family of five, for example, is $ 14,140 a year. Earning more than $ 7,700 disqualifies them for Medicaid in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` You see why people go on welfare in this situation,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> LaVallee </PERSON>, director of the Caring Program. `` It's incredible irony. People who are working, their children are worse off. That's tragic in a land that has prided itself on the things we have done. The program was established in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> in 1985 after two ministers approached <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Barone </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, and described the anguish of unemployed steelworkers. <PERSON> Barone </PERSON> discovered that 40,000 western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> children lacked health insurance, and that the problem spread far beyond the families of former steelworkers. <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> agreed to match contributions dollar for dollar, and to donate administrative costs, so children like <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> could get not only treatment but regular checkups while parents got back on their feet. Although the Caring Program does n't cover specialized care for chronically ill children and has no plans to do so, it hopes to help them indirectly with a five-year, $ 341,000 grant awarded Oct. 30 by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION> and the federal Office of Maternal and Child Health. The money will be used to train doctors to treat such lifetime ailments as diabetes or cystic fibrosis, said Dr. <PERSON> Woodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessel </PERSON> of the federal office. And parents of chronically ill children will be directed to service agencies and specialty clinics. The cost to the Caring Program of providing routine and preventive treatment is $ 156 per child per year. Youngsters are eligible as long as their families are above the Medicaid cutoff but below the federal poverty level. The parents pay nothing to participate in the program. The other states with Caring Programs are <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Four others plan to launch programs in January, but do n't want to be identified beforehand `` It's not a quick fix and then get out,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohling </PERSON>, executive director of the 1 -LCB- - year-old <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Caring Program for Children About 3,000 children are waiting to get into the program, almost as many as those currently in it; the state's eligible population is estimated at more than 35,000. In central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 17,500 youngsters are eligible for the Caring Program established Sept. 1. As of Nov. 1, 338 had been approved for assistance. `` Are we going to wait until some federal program that may come down a few years from now?'' asked <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The needs are out there.'' Acutely aware of those needs, the pediatrics academy is pushing for federal health insurance for all Americans under 21 and for pregnant women. Coverage would be furnished by parents' employers or a state insurance fund. `` When we solve this problem, we can home in on the next group that is really vulnerable,'' like senior citizens, <PERSON> LaVallee </PERSON> said. `` We have to keep attacking this with full strength.''

<HEAD>Cold Water Off Hawaii's Coast Turns Fish Farming High-Tech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINE DONNELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> KAILUA-KONA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> conjures up images of free-spending tourists lolling in the warm <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, but the state hopes icy water pumped from the ocean depths will also boost the islands' economy. `` <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> is in a unique position, because unlike the rest of the coastal states, the ocean bottom drops sharply from shore,'' said <PERSON> Kari </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and Science Technology Park on the island of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` The water down there is free of germs and real cold, so it can be used for everything from salmon farming to cold storage.'' The commercial HOST Park was dedicated in July and soon will begin renting land, cold seawater and facilities to aquaculture firms, several of which have done research next door at the Natural Energy Laboratory of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The 15-year-old laboratory is a pioneer in aquaculture. It draws cold, germ-free water from a depth of 2,200 feet to grow everything from strawberries to giant clams, and studies ocean thermal energy conversion _ using temperature differences between surface and deep water to generate electricity. The commercial park was a natural extension of the lab, and the two will likely be merged by next year's <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said. Weather and geography combine perfectly at <LOCATION> Keahole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s western shore, for `` ocean farming on land,'' she said. The bottom drops to depths of 15,000 feet, and pipes bring the nutrient-rich sea water _ which is colder than 50 degrees _ inland, where it is used in a warm, dry climate to nourish a variety of crops. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, brothers who formed <ORGANIZATION> Aquaculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, fill their ponds or `` raceways'' with the water and grow mature <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> lobsters in 2 -LCB- years, shaving 4 -LCB- years off the natural maturation rate. `` It's not a crazy concept. You can raise lobsters in the tropics as long as you have cold water,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` Besides being cold, having water this clean takes a lot of risks out of the operation.'' Moreover, by moving away from the ocean, the <ORGANIZATION> Wilsons </ORGANIZATION> can control other factors. `` Lobsters do n't grow in the winter in the wild, but in a controlled temperature they grow year-round. You do n't have to worry about predators ... and it's easier to control disease because there's no pollution.'' The brothers are in a demonstration phase now, but within three years they hope to farm 20 acres and produce 500,000 `` <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'' lobsters annually. Other companies cultivate abalone, salmon, lettuce, kelp and microalgae for health food and pharmaceuticals. The commercial park has 547 acres, and the lab takes up 322 acres. <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said leases for about half the available land are being negotiated, but price is a barrier for many interested firms. Tenants spend $ 10,000 to $ 80,000 an acre to grade and develop the rough volcanic terrain, and pay the state rent plus a percentage of their profits. The state and county also stand to profit from taxes and created jobs. `` Especially when they see the initial expense, it's hard to convince a salmon fisher who has nets in the ocean that he'd be better off with ponds on land, but he would be,'' <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said. `` They do n't know the advantages _ such as year-round production _ until they test it out. That's why we encourage them to start small at the lab, which acts as an incubator.'' The cold sea water and controlled environment are also ideal for land crops, such as strawberries. In prototype strawberry fields, cold sea water is pumped to the surface and through pipes in the ground to cool soil surrounding the plants. That way, the strawberries become dormant as they would in winter. When the cold water stops running, the sun warms the fruit and it thrives. Drip irrigation for the strawberries is provided by fresh water condensation that forms around the pipes carrying the sea water.

<HEAD>Scientists Seek Chink in Bugs' Armor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Using modern-day nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> has found what may be a chink in cockroaches' prehistoric armor. The `` cross-link'' is the place where chemicals are produced to make the ultra-hard exoskeleton, said <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> chemist. `` Once formed, these bonds are permanent and very hard to break. `` My collaborators are now isolating the essential enzymes and metabolites that help make the structure. Hopefully, they may be able to develop an inhibitor molecule, one that thwarts the enzyme's mode of action.'' In other words, an insecticide that would kill the pests by keeping them from developing the hard shell that holds them together. That may be easier said than done. `` There may not even be a compound that will work,'' said team member <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> chemist who works with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now that we know a little bit more about the structure, maybe we'll have a little more luck, eventually.'' In NMR, a sophisticated radio receiver-transmitter called a spectrometer identifies atoms by their distinct response to a magnetic field, so scientists can determine the makeup of a sample, such as an insect's shell. `` It's now time for the organic chemists and the pesticide chemists to look at that structure and come up with something that can use it,'' said <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. A new approach to the problem has been called for by people concerned over insects' ability to adapt to poisons and even biological controls. `` The short-sighted and irresponsible use of pesticides and antibiotics is producing strains of monster-bugs that are resistant to our chemical weapons,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON>, professor emeritus at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> who is outspoken on the subject of pesticide misuse. `` I doubt if we will ever be able to eradicate insect pests entirely,'' he said. `` Insects in every case become resistant to chemicals after a period of continued exposure, and they become resistant to the biological controls. But we can improve our methods of less toxic controls and it is clear we do n't want to keep relying on chemicals that are poisonous to both insects and man.'' Pesticides have found their way into groundwater and killed fish, wildlife and people. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> estimates 500,000 poisonings of humans and 20,000 deaths worldwide from insecticide each year. <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON> said <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>'s pioneering use of NMR `` a unique approach and an exciting contribution to the new-wave of insecticide research.'' <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> emphasized that much work needs to be done before his findings can be of direct benefit. `` We hope to find that the cross-link is different in each kind of insect. Any insecticide will have to be selective. `` You do n't want to kill every insect in the field _ some of them are beneficial. But now, at least, scientists can make a reasonable guess about what chemicals to look at.'' One of the problems in the past, he said, is that there was not enough communication between the disciplines in the scientific community. Chemists, biologists and entomolgists tended to go their separate ways. `` My whole strategy is to hook up with the best I can find in every field. So far, we have n't worked with microbiologists doing genetic engineering. But we're at least in the talking stage now.''

<HEAD>Music Volume `Comfort Level' Seems To Affect Driving Performance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 That rap or heavy metal music blaring from teen-agers' car stereos may not be the distraction some people think. People tend to react faster when music is at a personal `` comfort level,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Wichita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> psychologist <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who has tested about 100 people in a driving simulator. Subjects were told to brake when a red bulb lit, with music playing at different levels up to 80 decibels. An airplane landing nearby generates 120 or more decibels, rock concerts generally produce 90 or more, and ear damage can occur at 95 decibels. `` In general, we found that people reacted fastest when there was n't any music at all,'' Ms. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` And we expected as the music got louder they would get slower in their reaction time. What happened is that as they got to their preference level, they actually got a little bit faster.'' Gender difference also shows up in the tests, she said. Men have the fastest reaction time when there is n't any music, and women react fastest when the volume was right for them. Men tend to want the volume higher than women. Turner plans to expand the study to see what effect volume has on reaction time when people are trying to remember directions, listening to music they prefer and listening to music they do n't like When someone turns down the music to look for a street address or in heavy traffic, she said, `` Really, all a person is doing is saying, ` Hey. All of a sudden my driving task is n't automatic any more.'''

<HEAD>Scientist's `Pet' Microorganisms Eat Hazardous Waste</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Portier </PERSON> calls them pets, but others think his microorganisms may be an answer to hazardous waste problems. `` The bugs feed upon phenol and other organic materials found in nearly all carbon-based substances. ... These bugs eat and digest bad materials and produce environmentally neutral byproducts,'' said <PERSON> Portier </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researcher and three engineering firms have cleaned up a hazardous waste pond and 30,000 cubic feet of contaminated soil at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Plaquemine </LOCATION> plant. `` The water is impeccably clean, but the water was the least of the problems. The big problem was the sludge and chemicals underneath the water. That soil is now as safe as garden soil,'' he said. `` This is ... the first time we were able to use this natural process to resolve a large-scale hazardous waste disposal problem,'' said <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Tretter </PERSON>, environmental manager at the plant. <PERSON> Portier </PERSON>'s developments in adapting microorganisms to eat toxic materials also is planned for a Superfund cleanup at the Old Inger hazardous waste site near <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON>. It will be the first such use in a Superfund site. `` Only about 60 percent of the sites can be approached from a microbiology point of view, but the economics are quite attractive when it can work. It cost about one-third to one-half the cost of incineration,'' <PERSON> Portier </PERSON> said. The microorganisms could be used to clean up oil spills, too, he said. `` Our imagination is the only limit to the future application of this technology,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Remediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the firms involved in the cleanup.

 Tests on the skin of a chameleon heading for space on Wednesday could help scientists understand more about cell structure and offer clues to down-to-earth human problems like osteoporosis. `` In space, cells apparently make their normal products but sometimes these products ca n't get out,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammerstedt </PERSON>. He hopes to learn if cells that secrete hormones malfunction in low gravity because their structure is changed. The experiment will treat chameleon cells with hormones that change skin color from green to brown or brown to green. If the cells' structure changes in microgravity, one-thousandth normal, the hormone wo n't trigger the change. `` Chameleon skin color change is hormonally dependant and requires its own type of internal cell structure,'' said <PERSON> Hammerstedt </PERSON>, a biochemist with <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s NASA-funded Center for Cell Research. `` We picked a skin model because it has many of the same features as some of the more fragile cells we're interested in.'' Researchers also believe a hormone imbalance causes osteoporosis, muscle atrophy and other ailments, he said. Astronauts have experienced bone and muscle problems that mimic arthritis, osteoporosis and other diseases. <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Himer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> biochemist and director of the cell research center, has found in experiments on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet space missions that growth hormone secretions in rats are reduced by half in space.

 The company that is introducing facsimile machines to the nation's post offices was born out of frustration. It was 1985 and <PERSON> Edd </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> trying to rework a bid proposal due the next morning from his Miami-based electrical contracting firm. Late at night, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> asked the hotel desk for its fax number so he could receive documents from his main office. `` They said, ` What's a fax?''' said <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. `` I was stunned. I thought they were kidding.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' company lost the bid, but the incident sparked the idea for <ORGANIZATION> Hotelecopy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has installed fax machines in more than 1,700 hotels nationwide. On Monday, <PERSON> Hotelecopy </PERSON> moved into a new arena as the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s first customer fax machine opened in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> under a one-year program that will bring the devices to about 8,000 post offices nationwide. `` The fax machine is what the personal computer or automatic bank tellers once was,'' said the Hotelecopy president. `` It will become so integrated into <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> life that we will wonder how we got along without it. The post office has recognized that.'' Hotelecopy, which has contracted with <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for telephone connections to the machines, will install the credit card-operated fax machines in 54 post offices in the Northeast. It also plans to submit bids later this month to provide service for the remaining regions of the country. Customers will be charged $ 12.75 for three minutes of transmission, which is equivalent to about seven pages. Hotelecopy will pay the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> $ 150 a month rent for each location and an undisclosed percentage of revenue. Hotelecopy, which made its first public stock offering in September, had revenue of about $ 5 million last year. Even before <PERSON> Hotelecopy </PERSON> was founded, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, 43, said he was extolling the virtues of the fax. By the early 1980s, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said he decided to place purchase orders for his contracting company exclusively by fax. He then gave his suppliers three options: buy a fax, lease one from <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> or lose his business. Today, the Hotelecopy fax network moves about 50,000 pages a day. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> recently expanded the service to include translation services and secretarial work. `` A businessperson faxes down a document to us in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and we send back the translation,'' said <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Hoteleticket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a wholly owned subsidiary, has also placed airline ticket machines in about 50 hotels, from luxury resorts to chain establishments. The units can print a ticket and boarding pass within 10 minutes of order, said <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. `` There is a whole new definition of what fast is and what good service is,'' said <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. `` People today want things immediately and they do n't what to go out of their way to get it. Time is too precious.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> estimates fax machines are used in about 25 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses but fewer than 1 percent of homes. `` Think of the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker. You think they have a fax? But soon they may not be able to do without access to one,'' said <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. `` That's the void the post office will fill. The fax-less will no longer have to do without.''

None of the directors' ad agencies placed an ad on the decade's best list Of the 12 best ads, 10 involved television commercials, one was a print campaign and one used billboards. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, vice chairman and creative director of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said the directors generally were trying to identify ads that broke from convention and spawned imitators of their own. But he said 1985 commercials for <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s 501 jeans, which showed young people in urban settings cast in a blue-shaded hue, had a style copied widely. `` A lot of commercials became blue,'' he said. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said the top-rated `` Fast Talker'' ad from <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 brought activity to a halt in many households each time the commercial aired. A separate <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> campaign from 1980 that showed top executives anxious to get a package delivered picking up the phone and saying `` Hello-o-o Federal'' broke the ad taboo of `` Never make the customer look silly,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 1984'' ad showed a dreary scene of prisoners filing in for a televised address by a dogmatic leader. The gloom was shattered when a woman tossed a club that broke the screen. The ad ran only once _ during the telecast of the 1984 Superbowl football game _ but <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said no other ad has had more impact on one airing. Authorship of a memorable ad in the 1980s did not necessarily mean an ad agency kept the assignment. Ally & amp; <PERSON> Gargano </PERSON>, which made the two winning <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> ads, is no longer the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> agency, and <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> has dropped Chiat-Day, which made `` 1984,'' as its agency. But Chiat-Day offices, now known as Chiat-Day-Mojo, were responsible for five of the 12 best ads, according to the One Club survey. Here is the list of best ads of the decade, the year and the agency responsible for them, according to The One Club: 1. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, `` Fast-Talker,'' 1982, <ORGANIZATION> Ally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Gargano </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. 2.

<HEAD>Whittle Considers High-Tech TV Network for Doctors' Waiting Rooms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The media concern <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> thinks it's not enough to have taken over the magazine racks in doctors offices with its series of magazines. Now it wants to get patients to watch its TV programs as they wait for their appointment. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said Wednesday it is developing a closed-circuit, advertiser-supported television network for installation in 100,000 medical waiting rooms nationwide. The company disclosed it was developing the new TV project on the same day it launched the first in a series of non-fiction books that contain advertising and are being given for free to 150,000 civic and business leaders. Whittle executives hope to decide by year's end whether to proceed with a large-scale test of the new TV project, which they said could be the company's largest to date and one of the biggest in broadcasting, with a potential audience of 30 million a week. The <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based company, which is 50 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is already in 60,000 doctor's offices with either its Special Reports magazines or sponsored posters. The TV project has the potential to generate more annual revenue than the $ 90 million expected from <LOCATION> Whittle </LOCATION>'s other television project, the Channel One daily news show for teens that <LOCATION> Whittle </LOCATION> plans to launch in March in 1,000 middle and high schools, Whittle executives said. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, vice chairman of Whittle and the executive in charge of the new TV project, said the system would deliver programming live by satellite to doctors' waiting rooms. The rooms would be equipped with advanced viewing systems _ possibly high-definition TV sets, multi-screen sets or wide-screen TV. `` We want to offer something as different from existing TV technology as color was from black-and-white,'' he said. He said it has not been determined what kind of programming would be carried on the system, but said that possibilities under study include a health-related program or an entertainment program. Whittle would produce the program, which may last an hour or so, and the show would be repeated continuously during the day, he said. A new show could be produced every week or two, he said. The project could involve more than $ 250 million in technology alone, well above the $ 150 million being spent on Channel One. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said the TV project is a logical extension of Whittle's involvement with publications targeted to people in medical waiting rooms. Special Reports, a series of six quarterly publications, are read by about 60 percent of the people visiting the 17,000 doctors' waiting rooms where the magazines are available, he said The audience is predominantly women with children, an appealing target for many advertisers that is often hard to reach in large numbers with other media. He said <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> has received `` very positive vibes'' from the medical community about its plans for a TV network. If the TV project is launched, <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said, advertisers would probably be given the chance to buy packages that would include ads in the magazines and on the TV network with the guarantee that competing brands would not appear. He said it had not yet been determined how much advertising time would be sold on each program, but said it would probably be less than the 16 minutes of network and local advertising carried each hour on broadcast television. Whittle plans to decide in late December whether to undertake a large-scale test of the system, <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. The test could begin in mid-1990, he said, and if that proves successful, the project could be launched nationally the following summer. The main stumbling blocks, he said, are assurances that the programming can be delivered on time and the cost of technology. The first book in what Whittle is calling The Larger Agenda series is `` The Trouble with Money'' by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Greider </PERSON>, who wrote `` The Secrets of the Temple,'' which explored the Federal Reserve System. The books in the series are slimmer than most regular books so that harried opinion-makers will read them, said Whittle editor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rukeyser </PERSON>. <PERSON> Greider </PERSON>'s book runs 96 pages with 18 pages of advertising, all of it from <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the air courier based in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> also is shipping the books for free to 150,000 government and business leaders over the next few days In addition, the book will be available without advertising for $ 11.95 in 150 selected Waldenbooks stores later this month. <PERSON> Rukeyser </PERSON> said <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> hopes to publish one new book in the series every two months.

<HEAD>Fed Lowers Key Interest Rate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, after weeks of complaints from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration about high interest rates, has nudged a key interest rate lower in a move analysts predicted would trigger widespread declines in a variety of consumer and business borrowing rates. Economists were looking for commerical banks to cut by one-half percentage point their prime lending rate, which is used as a base to calculate more than one-third of their business and consumer loans. One bank, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that it was cutting its prime lending rate from 10.5 percent to 10 percent. While the move was not immediately followed by the country's largest banks, analysts predicted that it would be, perhaps later this week Many economists predicted that the easier <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> monetary policy would accelerate a move to lower mortgage rates. Wall Street was buoyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s actions with stock prices up sharply on investor optimism that the central bank was moving to keep the economy from slipping into a recession. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks closed with a gain of 26.23 points at 2,623.36. As usual, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> made no announcement of its decision to move toward an easier monetary policy. However, analysts said there was little doubt that such a decision had been made, given the fact that a bellwether interest rate, the federal funds rate, traded again Wednesday at 8.5 percent, down from 8.75 percent when the week began. The federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each other to make overnight loans. Because it is directly influenced by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s decisions on the amount of cash to make available to the banking system, it considered the best gauge of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy intentions. `` It is clear that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has eased,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The central bank is acting to prevent the economy from heading into a serious downturn.'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> officials refused comment on a report in Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that the decision to ease was made during a telephone conference call Monday among members of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, composed of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> board members in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and presidents of five of the 12 regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks. The <ORGANIZATION> FOMC </ORGANIZATION>, which gathers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> eight times a year to map monetary strategy, will meet Tuesday and some economists expressed surprise that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> took action this week instead of waiting for the regularly scheduled meeting. The quarter-point drop in the federal funds rate this week is the fifth small decline that has occurred since late May when the central bank began to reverse a year-long effort to drive interest rates higher as a way to fight inflationary pressures. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and others in the administration have been complaining that the central bank has been moving too slowly to lower interest rates. White House Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> warned in August that if the economy does slip into a recession, it will be the fault of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s tight-money policies. Some economists, however, said Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was wrong to buckle to political pressure, warning that the action could make inflationary pressures worse in 1990. `` I am very disappointed in the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and very pessimisitc about the chances of keeping inflation down,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> DRI-McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. `` They may be thinking that they can loosen, rescue the economy and then tighten again, but experience has shown that does n't usually work.'' Other economists were not as pessimistic, saying that if the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had waited to ease until it got inflation down further, it would have run an even greater risk of dumping the economy into a downturn. `` Central banks in the past have made big errors in fighting inflation for too long and then watching as the economy tumbles into a widespread, broad recession,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. `` That just intensified the downturn and forced the central bank to pump up the economy with easy money, creating a bust-boom situation.'' Various analysts said they believed that a hallmark of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> under Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has been a gradual approach to either tightening or loosening monetary policy and for that reason they said that the 0.25 percent drop in the federal funds rate would not be followed quickly by further decreases. But even the modest reduction will be enough to prompt reductions in the prime rate and other business and consumer borrowing rates, economists predicted. Mortgage rates have already dropped into single digits with fixed-rate mortgages averaging 9.82 percent last week, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Some economists forecast that rates could drop by another one-half percentage point by the end of the year in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s easier credit moves.

<HEAD>Guidelines Unveiled For Punishing Corporate Wrongdoers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sentencing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has unveiled draft guidelines for punishing corporate wrongdoers that would dramatically increase fines for companies convicted of federal crimes. The draft guidelines, published Wednesday in the Federal Register, contain elaborate formulas for calculating the fines that companies would be required to pay for a variety of federal crimes. Only 350 companies, mostly small, are convicted of federal crimes each year. But in recent years large frauds committed by big corporations have increased the average fine paid by companies from $ 48,000 between 1984 and 1987 to $ 195,000 last year, according to studies performed by the commission. `` There is no question this is a dramatic increase in criminal fines,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an assistant professor of management at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and former staff member of the sentencing commission who studied corporate fines. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said his study of fines `` suggests that currently if you impose a $ 1 harm you'll pay 20 cents to a dollar in criminal fines.'' `` But under these guidelines, it looks like the criminal penalty will be between two and three times the harm. That could be as much as a tenfold increase over current practice.'' The commision said in a draft policy statement that `` punishment of a convicted organization will provide a strong incentive for owners and managers of organizations to strengthen internal mechanisms for preventing officers and employees from committing crimes and for detecting and punishing such crimes that are committed.'' The proposed guidelines, which contain two basic options for calculating fines, will be open for public comment until Feb. 15. The commission, which was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, will submit final guidelines to lawmakers on May 1, 1990. The guidelines would become law unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacts legislation overturning or altering them. The new guidelines contain a number of factors that must be taken into account when calculating how much money a company would be fined. Aggravating factors include whether top executives aided or condoned the crimes or whether these officials tried to block a government investigation. An offense that `` presented a substantial risk to the continued existence of a financial or consumer market'' would also expose a company to additional fines. Fines would be reduced for mitigating factors such as a reasonable lack of knowledge of the crimes by high-level executives. In the case of companies found to be created solely to perform criminal activity, the fine should be large enough to divest the firm of its assets, according to the proposal. Two years ago, the sentencing guidelines for individual defendants took effect. They require courts to calculate the sentences according to elaborate formulas taking into account criminal history and the circumstances of the crime.

<HEAD>S&amp;Ls With Insufficient Capital Must Report To Government By Mid-January</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-S&amp;L Convention, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Savings and loan institutions with insufficient capital must advise the government by mid-January how they plan to meet tough new money requirements or face operating restrictions, the government said. The new capital standards were announced Monday by the Office of Thrift Supervision, created by the savings and loan bailout law passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last summer. The agency announced guidelines Wednesday for thrifts unable to meet the standards. `` Those institutions that will fall below the new standards on Dec. 7 must submit an acceptable capital plan to raise their capital levels or be subjected to operating restrictions including growth and capital distribution limitations and regulatory approvals of changes in management and the board of directors,'' the <ORGANIZATION> OTS </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the plan must be submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> OTS </ORGANIZATION> district director within 60 days of Nov. 7, the day the standards became effective. Institutions that subsequently fail to meet the requirements will have 60 days after falling out of compliance to file plans. The plans must show what actions the institutions will take to meet the new standards no later than Dec. 31, 1994. The <ORGANIZATION> OTS </ORGANIZATION> has said that as many as 800 thrifts with assets totaling $ 600 billion would not be able to meet the standards, which are intended to provide a bigger cushion of capital to absorb losses before an institution fails and its deposits become eligible for federal insurance coverage. Anticipating the new standards, many thrifts have been selling assets and reducing their size recently. Thrifts may apply for exemptions from capital directives or from specific sanctions or penalties imposed for failing to meet their capital standards, the guidelines said. Such requests must be accompanied by acceptable capital plans demonstrating that the standards can be met. In addition, the plans must: _ Demonstrate that the thrift's increases in capital will meet or exceed interim targets for capital levels and can be measured on a quarterly basis _ Set forth the manner and timing in which capital increases will be achieved

<HEAD>Key Provisions of Minimum Wage Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Minimum Wage, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are key provisions of the legislation to increase the minimum wage to $ 4.25 an hour while creating a new subminimum wage for certain teen-age workers. The bill becomes effective next April 1.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE RATE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The minimum wage, $ 3.35 an hour since January 1981, would increase to $ 3.80 on April 1, 1990 and to $ 4.25 on April 1, 1991. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last year estimated that nearly 4 million Americans worked at the minimum wage.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE SUBMINIMUM</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Workers 16-19 may be paid the subminimum for their first three months in the work force, and for an additional three months if receiving formal training. No one over 20 or with six months total job experience may be paid the subminimum. The subminimum will be $ 3.35 an hour when the minimum wage rises to $ 3.80. It will be $ 3.61 an hour when the minimum wage reaches $ 4.25. Migrant seasonal farmworkers are exempt from the subminimum and the entire subminimum provision expires in April 1993.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TIP CREDIT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Employers may now pay workers who receive tips 40 percent of the minimum wage provided the tips bring the hourly pay at least to the minimum. That will be 45 percent on April 1 and 50 percent a year later.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SMALL BUSINESS EXEMPTION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Small businesses with gross sales of $ 362,500 currently are exempt from the federal minimum wage law, although all but eight states have their own minimum wage laws and their exemptions vary. The federal exemption would expand to $ 500,000.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>OTHER EXEMPTIONS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The bill continues the more than four pages of hundreds of special exemptions already in the law. Examples are some farm workers, including tobacco leaf harvesters, casual babysitters, newspaper delivery workers, amusement park employees, wreath makers, employees at small radio stations in cities with a population below 25,000 and mollusk and crustacean harvesters.

 <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s ads for its new Infiniti models will retain their focus on fuzzy images of nature, such as ponds of pensive trout and gentle cloudbursts, rather than the high-performance luxury cars. `` There are more rocks and pussywillows to come,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s general manager for the Infiniti line, said at a ceremony Wednesday marking the day the Japanese cars officially went on sale. Infiniti has two models, the Q45 full-size four-door sedan, with a base price of $ 38,000, and the M30 sports coupe at $ 23,500 _ expensive but less costly than European luxury cars. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> officials such as <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> believe the cars are so good that they, along with <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s new Lexus luxury line, will force other prestige automakers to offer incentives to buyers or cut prices, as <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> already have done. But Infiniti's ads have avoided direct shots of the cars. Instead, they soft-focus on falling rain, birds in flight, crashing waves, hay fields and rock outcroppings, giving just a passing glimpse of the cars. A meditative text accompanies the moody images. The idea is to pique buyers' interest and get them into showrooms. Enough already, many observers say. `` What they've clearly been trying to do is develop an anticipation for the vehicle itself, and they're creating a mystery about it,'' said <PERSON> Arvid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jouppi </PERSON>, an auto analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Keane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. But he said that now that the car is on sale, `` Sooner or later they've got to bring it out in the ads. `` You may talk to the girl on the phone, but you do n't propose to her that way. Some things you need to do face to face,'' <PERSON> Jouppi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said anyone prepared to pay for a luxury car will take the time to compare the Infiniti to the Lexus and other cars regardless of what ads are like. `` I'm not enough of an -LRB- advertising -RRB- expert to say whether this feel-good advertising will work,'' <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> said. `` But this is not like getting <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sixpack </PERSON> to stir from his television. The guy who is going to spend $ 40,000 is going to check it out.'' Lexus, whose models list for $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 less than Infiniti's, was introduced Sept. 1. Through Oct. 31 its dealers sold just under 8,000 cars, about what Lexus predicted. Infiniti officials have avoided sales projections, however, and there are just 50 Infiniti dealers in 30 markets in the country. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> are among the areas without dealers. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said the company had been extremely selective, intentionally starting slowly to ensure quality service and workmanship. But he predicted Infiniti would have 100 dealers within a year and up to 165 in five years. As for when TV watchers will get more than just a glance of the cars, he said surveys of car buyers and dealers would be the determining factor. `` We'll let the market reaction tell us what to do. Let's watch the next three or four months and see how the market reacts, and we'll go from there.''

 Major airlines officials are raising strong objections to congressional moves to reimpose government control over their industry. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee heard testimony Wednesday on legislation that would alter several practices sponsors say have driven small airlines out of business and kept others from starting up. Calling for even stronger action, Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, introduced the Airline Reregulation Act that would allow the government once again to regulate fares, routes, and services. The industry was deregulated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1978. `` I do n't know if complete reregulation is the answer,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said. `` But I do know it's time we owned up to the fact that airline deregulation was a mistake.'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> appeared as a witness before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>'s aviation subcommittee, which was discussing an airline competition bill opponents said also would bring regulation back. That legislation, sponsored by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., would force big airlines to give up their computerized reservations systems, stop them from booking flights on smaller airlines as if they are their own, end the selling of slots at major airports and strengthen the government's ability to increase `` Instead of a proliferation of choices, consumers are increasingly faced with little or no choice'' in airline service, <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, told the committee the proposals would `` diminish, not enhance, competition.'' He acknowledged that computer reservations systems give airlines who own them a competitive advantage, but he denied this was because of anything mechanically built into the systems, which are provided to travel agents for booking flights. `` Why should we be deprived of an advantage we have earned?'' <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> asked. He said the government should concentrate on building more airports and other facilities to increase competition instead of restricting successful airlines. `` The message I hear is that we are free to be innovative, free to risk capital, free to compete, as long as we lose money,'' <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> told the committee. `` If we are successful, the rug is likely to be pulled out from under us.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Callison </PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, said forced divestiture of reservations systems would produce increased air fares. <PERSON> Callison </PERSON> said a provision of the bill that would prevent airlines from linking up with small commuter airlines would punish airlines that have not taken over smaller carriers. `` <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s connection carriers operate as independent companies, not owned by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, and are major examples of small business at its best,'' he said. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON>, chief executive of the small <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, indicated general support for the bill and suggested it also call for an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> investigation of frequent flyer programs. `` These programs, although quite popular, are among the most antithetical to the spirit and goals of airline deregulation,'' <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said. He noted businesses often pay for the tickets, but employees can use the frequent flyer tickets without being taxed for the benefit. `` The programs do not promote new business, they simply allow airlines to charge higher prices for the business that they are already receiving,'' <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said. Most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, including <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, award flights and other benefits for customers who regularly fly with them. <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> also proposed that airlines be prohibited from paying extra commissions to travel agents who book a high number of passengers on carriers whose reservations systems they are using.

<TEXT>
 Under the growing threat of an outside takeover, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots are again talking with management and possible investors about an employee buyout of the company. Directors of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, have given Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> the go-ahead to explore a deal, <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. The pilots in October spearheaded an attempted employee buyout of the airline company, but the bid failed for lack of financing. <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> said the pilots have met with management, and the union is `` continuing to explore any and all options in its effort to gain employee control of the airline.'' `` All I can say is the pilots are seeking employee ownership with the current management team,'' <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> said. He did not, however, exclude an effort with other parties. Investor <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, who was a passive investor in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> and recently sold a sizable stake, met with pilot representatives Tuesday and indicated he might participate in a bid `` under the right circumstances,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> quoted an anonymous source as saying. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> last week sought government clearance to acquire more than a 15 percent stake in the company. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said he is aware that <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> directors have given <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> the go-ahead to explore buyout possibilities, but it does n't change his goals. He said: `` ... There has been no change in our plans'' to gain control of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. We've been talking to all interested parties and will continue to do so.'' <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment group, met Wednesday with representatives of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s Machinist union. The meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was to hear what the group was planning for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> of the Machinists, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s largest union representing 25,000 of its 70,000 workers. He said the union was not seeking to reach any immediate agreements with the group, which last week announced that it had bought up 9.7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> refused to elaborate on the substance of the meeting. The Machinists have opposed the employee ownership plan promoted by the pilots and contributed to its collapse in October. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> wants to reduce <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors from 16 members to five, three of whom would be <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principals. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON> declined to comment on the latest developments. Directors of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement last month indicating the board would not consider any offer under $ 300 a share _ the per-share price that failed in October. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock gained $ 5.25 in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Wednesday to $ 185 a share.

 <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the movie `` The Wizard of Oz,'' is off to see the banker to turn the Yellow Brick Road into gold. The 50th anniversary of the release of the movie has ignited a marketing mania of movie memorabilia. <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, which also owns `` Gone With the Wind,'' stands to make millions from Oz license rights alone. Turner has re-released the original movie to theaters across the country and is selling a special Oz anniversary videocassette. The tape includes 17 minutes of previously unseen footage of <LOCATION> Buddy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ebsen </LOCATION>, the original Tin Man. The role went to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> after <PERSON> Ebsen </PERSON> suffered an allergic reaction to the Tin Man's makeup. The video, introduced in early October, already has sold more than 2 million copies at $ 24.95 each. Turner has produced a catalog to help fans skip through the merchandising department of the <LOCATION> Emerald </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the privacy of their homes. It includes a special `` Wizard of Oz'' jean jacket for $ 250, as well as a similar `` Gone With the Wind'' jacket. `` It's amazing the amount of interest people have about the Oz collection,'' said <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, general manager of the CNN Turner Store. `` It just keeps going.'' So far 49 companies have received licenses to market products, ranging from Franklin Mint heirloom dolls, which retail from $ 135 to $ 245, to lunchboxes and playing cards. Several hundred people are on waiting lists for official Oz silk-sreened color prints from artist <ORGANIZATION> Melanie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> which sell for $ 2,500 each. The <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Costume </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> is producing 500 pairs of ruby slippers, replicas from the original mold of those <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> wore as <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, for $ 5,000 a pair. `` We're getting 20 calls a day and we've only made three pair so far,'' said company President <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON>. `` This -LRB- the Oz movie -RRB- is one of the great dreams of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. People want a piece of it.'' A reproduction pair of ruby slippers is on display at the <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION>, not for sale. But a ruby slipper rhinestone pin can be purchased for $ 150. Turner Entertainment is not the only entity profiting from Oz mania. Auction houses selling props from the film also have profited. One of the supposedly original seven pairs of ruby slippers sold for $ 165,000 last year. The pointed Wicked Witch's hat <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> wore sold for $ 33,000. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>'s twister-proof gingham dress went for a non-bargain basement $ 22,000. And the Cowardly Lion's can of `` witch remover'' brought in $ 20,000 for a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> collection house in June. There's even new interest in Oz author <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>. `` The Dreamer of Oz,'' an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> movie scheduled to air at Easter, is due to start production next month with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> as <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> was 44 when `` The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' was published in 1900 and made him wealthy. He died in 1919 and his creation is still a moneymaker.

 <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has received government clearance to include four railroads controlled by <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nekoosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in its bid to acquire the paper products company. The <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> approved the clearance, which is required when the holder of a railroad seeks to acquire another, said <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` This is part of the process,'' Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Both <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> and Great Northern control railroads, and this is a clearance necessary for approval to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION>'s railroads.'' Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> now controls four `` short line'' railroads, used primarily to transport products and raw materials to and from company facilities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Great Northern, based in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, also controls four rail lines _ two in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, one in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> last month announced a $ 3.13 billion offer to acquire Great Northern. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> company has offered $ 58 a share for each of <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION>'s approximately 54 million shares of outstanding stock.

<HEAD>Court Suspends Chemical Giant's Gene Technology Plans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A West German court has blocked plans by a leading chemical concern, <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, to start production of insulin with the help of genetic engineering. An administrative court in the city of <LOCATION> Kassel </LOCATION> issued a temporary injunction Wednesday saying the giant West German company can not roceed with its plans as long as there is no federal law governing gene technology. Such legislation is not expected to go into effect before the start of 1991. The ruling, which reversed an earlier decision, sparked concern about <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ability to compete in the high-technology field of genetic engineering. The court gave no final verdict on the substance of the case, based on the suit filed by two citizens in 1985 against the <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON> state government's license for the insulin project. The spread of genetic technology is opposed by environmental groups and parts of the German general public. <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, said it will suspend construction on the project for the time being and said it does not expect a quick settlement of the dispute. The company said it views developments `` with great concern because the future of the industrial use of genetic technology in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> thus remains in limbo.'' <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON> state governor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallmann </PERSON> said the court verdict affects `` the position of all of West German industry'' and urged federal authorities to speed work on the legislation. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily newspaer said the delay, `` which could last for years, is even more painful for the company because its competition abroad can meanwhile gain experience with the new technology.'' The 70-million-mark -LRB- about $ 38 million -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> project involves making human insulin for diabetics from genetically altered bacteria. Pilot production was due to start early next year. <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> currently makes insulin from the pancreas of pigs. Wednesday's court decision can be challenged only in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> officials headquarters in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> declined to say whether they plan an appeal.

 Police on Thursday charged 10 individuals and their employers <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> in connection with irregularities in a 1987 sale of $ 1.3 billion worth of <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> stock. The announcement followed the arrest and release earlier Thursday of an unspecified number of individuals. The 10 defendants were charged with conspiracy to defraud and they are scheduled to appear before City of <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, police said. The investment firms <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> also were charged with conspiracy to defraud, as well as with conspiracy to contravene Section 13 of the Prevention of Fraud -LRB- Investments -RRB- Act 1958, police said. The police, and the Serious Fraud Squad, a central governmental unit charged with investigating financial crime, have been conducting an investigation into what is known as the Blue Arrow affair. The investigation began after the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> released a report in July on the events during and after the sale of shares to existing stockholders. The report severely criticized <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, its <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> unit, and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> UBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> and Drew for their conduct in the transaction. <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Natwest </LOCATION> was British employment agency Blue Arrow's adviser in its 1987 bid for <ORGANIZATION> Manpower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a much larger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment company When a $ 1.3 billion stock sale to finance the bid flopped, <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> obscured how much of the stock was left in the investment firms' hands. A series of top-level resignations followed publication of the trade department's report, including that of the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION>, Lord <PERSON> Boardman </PERSON>, and three board directors. Police said the people charged were <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Villiers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Domville </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Stainforth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON> and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>.

Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which has been operating under Chapter 11 protection of the federal Bankruptcy Code, today announced that the <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has withdrawn $ 400 million in financing. The company had been counting on the money to cover some of its claims and continue operations while it develops a reorganization plan to emerge from bankruptcy court protection. Allegheny International said other financing alternatives were being explored. A disclosure hearing on <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s most recent plan to reorganize its debts was scheduled for this morning in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The company has been operating under Chapter 11 since February 1988. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON>, which was created by two former vice presidents of the investment bank <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION>, is best known for an unsuccessful bid earlier this year to acquire <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based holding company with railroad interests. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON>'s proposed offer includes $ 90 million in equity from <ORGANIZATION> Japonica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, $ 70 million in other investor financing, $ 335.8 million in bank financing, $ 135 million in `` excess cash,'' and $ 53 million in debt reinstatement and tax and loan offsets, <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> said. It contains no high-yield financing, the so-called junk bonds that have been under attack on Wall Street lately. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> said it was confident it could raise the financing. Proposed investors also include the <ORGANIZATION> Steinhardt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> money management firm that holds a stake in <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, and several `` global institutions,'' <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON>'s letter stated. <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON> is also a creditor in <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy case <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> last month filed two alternate plans to emerge from bankruptcy. The company has filed a total of eight plans in its efforts to reorganize but has met consistent opposition from creditors and shareholders. Its debts currently total about $ 500 million.

 Stock prices rose slightly today in a generally positive response to the latest statistics on inflation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 2.87 to 2,626.23 in the first half hour of trading.

Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 21.08 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.4 percent in October. Excluding food and energy prices that are subject to large fluctuations from month to month, the increase was 0.1 percent. Analysts said those figures provided fresh support for hopes that inflationary pressures would remain subdued enough to keep interest rates from rising significantly and allow for continued economic growth. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> seemed to signal in advance its favorable view of the inflation outlook with a move this week to relax its credit policy slightly.

 The government received a check worth $ 1.1 billion Thursday for the sale of the state-owned steel company to the private sector. Finance Minister <PERSON> Barend </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Plessis </PERSON> said the money would be used to reduce debt, thereby helping the government save about $ 200 million a year in interest payments. The check, believed the be the largest ever written in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, represented proceeds from the sale of 1.85 billion shares in <ORGANIZATION> Iscor </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest steel and iron producer. Shares were sold at 2 rand each _ or roughly 76 cents _ to 300,000 purchasers. However, a controlling interest in the company was offered to a range of major financial institutions and not made available to the general public. About 54,000 Iscor employees, many of them blue-collar workers, received 100 shares free. <ORGANIZATION> Iscor </ORGANIZATION> will continue to be run by its current management. The board of directors will be determined by the major institutional shareholders. The Iscor shares were listed on the <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> for the first time on Wednesday, the largest listing in the exchange's 101-year history. The result was a day of hectic trading that saw <ORGANIZATION> Iscor </ORGANIZATION> stock rise from an opening price of 2.25 rand to 2.27 rand at the close. The exchange said 32 million Iscor shares changed hands, by far the most highly traded new listing ever on the exchange. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Plessis </PERSON> said the privatization would enable the government to spend less on interest payments and gain revenue by taxing <ORGANIZATION> Iscor </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Wang Announces `Reordering' of Business, Layoff of 2,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the struggling computer maker that cut about 5,000 workers this year and posted financial losses, today announced it would lay off 2,000 more workers as part of a `` fundamental reordering.'' `` Immediate and deliberate action does not call for another reorganization,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, president of the Lowell-based company, said. `` Rather it demands a revolution _ a radical and fundamental reordering of the way in which every individual at Wang follows through on their respective responsibility to our customers,'' he said in a news release. The company's new approach, according to <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, will eliminate bureaucracy to put <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> in closer touch with the needs of its customers. `` We must become increasingly more efficient in the way we work,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The result will be the elimination of approximately 2,000 jobs throughout the company by Jan. 1. A severance package for these employees will result in a onetime charge of $ 30 million against earnings in the company's second quarter, which ends Dec. 31. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> last month reported a first-quarter loss of $ 62.1 million, and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said at the time he expected losses to continue through the second quarter. But he predicted the company would return to profitability by the fourth quarter next June. <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year had cut about 5,000 employees, lowering its workforce to approximately 25,000. The high-tech industry has suffered other setbacks. <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced last month it would eliminate 2,200 jobs, and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> recently offered voluntary severance to 700 workers. `` To survive and prosper in the maturing market of the next decade, <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> must acknowledge that our customers are our lifeline,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> would change the way it operates in various phases of its business, including product development, technical service support and the process of taking orders for products and shipping them.

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Up 0.4 Percent in October</HEAD>

comment. A version moved on general news wires.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Wholesale prices, pushed up by the steepest increase in food costs in 22 months, rose 0.4 percent in October, the government reported today. The increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index was markedly smaller than the 0.9 percent jump in September but was still surprisingly high to many economists. The September and October advances followed rare monthly declines in July and August. Prices have been on a roller coaster this year, first surging ahead and then easing during the summer after food and energy costs moderated. For the first 10 months of the year, wholesale prices have been rising at an annual rate of 5.2 percent, compared with an increase of 4 percent for all of 1988. Food costs rose a steep 1.4 percent in October, following declines in three of the four previous months. Analysts said the jump in food costs reflected in part bad weather that affected <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vegetable crops. Vegetable prices shot up 18.9 percent. Other big advances in the food category were a 9.5 percent increase in pork costs, a 5.6 percent rise in fish prices and a 4.9 percent increase for fruit. The overall 1.4 percent advance in food costs was the biggest advance since a 1.5 percent rise in January 1988. But analysts said the one-month increase in the volatile food category was not alarming given the fact that food costs had been falling. Economists said they continued to believe that slower economic growth would translate into lower inflationary pressures in the months ahead. `` Assuming that food and energy prices remain relatively stable, we expect further moderation in prices in 1990,'' said <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kottman </PERSON>, assistant director of economic forecasting at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Energy costs, which had been the driving force behind the September spurt in the overall index, moderated in October to a slight 0.2 percent increase, far below the 6.5 percent surge in the previous month. Gasoline prices were up 2.3 percent after a 10.6 percent jump in September. The cost of natural gas dropped by 2.5 percent while home heating prices fell by 0.5 percent last month. Wholesale prices, excluding energy and food costs, were up a tiny 0.1 percent in October. Many analysts consider this figure a better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures. New-car prices, which had also been a major factor in the September inflation report, fell by 1.4 percent in October at the start of the new model year. Before adjusting for normal seasonal variations, the wholesale price index stood at 114.8 in October. This meant that a hypothetical marketbasket of goods that cost $ 100 in the base year of 1982 would have cost $ 114.80 last month, up from a cost of $ 109.40 a year ago. Many economists are looking for price increases to be moderate for the rest of this year and into 1990 as inflation is held in check by a slowing economy. This forecast is based on a belief that there will be no special factors pushing up costs, such as the 1988 drought that caused food prices to soar. As 1989 began, policymakers at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> were pushing interest rates higher in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures. However, they switched tactics in May and started lowering rates in an effort to keep the economy from tumbling into a recession. The latest round of interest rate declines came this week when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> boosted the amount of cash reserves available to the banking system. This allowed the federal funds rate to fall from 8.75 percent to 8.5 percent. This rate, which is the interest banks charge each other to make overnight loans, is a key short-term lending rate which is closely watched for clues to <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy intentions. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> action came after weeks of complaints from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration that the central bank was moving too slowly to lower interest rates and would have to shoulder the blame if the economy toppled into a recession. Economists predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s move would translate into lower consumer and business loan rates, including an expected cut in the benchmark prime lending rate from 10.5 percent down to 10 percent. The prime rate is used as a base to calculate more than one-third of all business and consumer loans.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> today banned milk sales by more than 900 farms because of lead-tainted feed that killed 18 cattle, and the government blamed the contamination on a criminal conspiracy. Hundreds of Dutch farms also were affected after dozens of cattle died of lead poisoning. In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> MacSharry </PERSON> ordered an immediate investigation into the alleged conspiracy that is believed to stretch across several EEC nations. <PERSON> MacSharry </PERSON> will contact `` all the relevant authorities in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' said an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. British Agriculture Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gummer </PERSON> said a shipment of rice bran used as cattle feed started in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, and was contaminated with lead from other cargo aboard the ship on its journey to the Belgian port of <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>. Authorities in <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION> diverted the feed to <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> for destruction, he said. But instead it passed through several hands and was turned into maize pellets that ended up being sold by a feed importing company in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. `` There has been a major criminal conspiracy,'' said <PERSON> Gummer </PERSON> said. `` It has meant that there are 300 farms in <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> which are under restriction and I have no doubt that by the time we have completed the material here during the day, we may have as many as 1,000 farms or just over that in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' he said in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio interview. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said milk from the 940 affected British farms, mostly in southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, is being collected separately for testing and thousands of gallons have been withheld from public sale. The ministry said milk from 200 farms had been tested and 89 were found to have milk above the trigger level for concern about lead contamination but below the safety level of 200 parts of lead per billion. Officials said most of the farms which had received the feed had now been traced. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Gummer </PERSON> urged the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to open a full-scale inquiry into the alleged conspiracy. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> deputy president <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Naish </PERSON> said farmers had suffered heavy losses. `` There are going to be some very substantial civil claims _ initially against the suppliers of the feed and then going back further down the chain,'' he said. In The Hague, <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mat </PERSON> <PERSON> Thissen </PERSON> said that the Dutch authorities had thoroughly investigated the origin of the tainted rice bran after more several dozen cattle died of lead poisoning in the northern <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> last month. `` The -LRB- feed -RRB- component was traced to a firm in <LOCATION> Dronten </LOCATION> -LRB- in the central <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> -RRB-, then to back <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION> and also <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Thissen </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, adding that he hoped the inquest would be completed by next week. He disputed part of <PERSON> Gummer </PERSON>'s account, saying there was no evidence yet indicating that the cattle feed had been shipped to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> to be destroyed. <PERSON> Thissen </PERSON> said the Dronten firm had exported part of the tainted rice bran to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, but he did not know the quantity involved.

 <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, the golden boy of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> gaming, is putting the finishing touches on his $ 630 million Mirage resort, just down the Strip from where this city's glitz ignited his imagination 37 years ago. Employees began reporting for orientation earlier this month to work out the kinks before the doors open to the public Nov. 22. The Sugar <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard-Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> fight follows at the resort Dec. 7. <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>'s 30-story showplace cost more than 100 times the value of the cluster of casinos that dotted the Strip when he first visited here in 1952. And it has sparked a multibillion-dollar building boom unprecedented in the city's history. New resorts are popping out of the desert and renovations and expansions are under way at many of the city's older properties. Some operators admit privately they're fixing up and adding on because of the challenge of the 3,049-room Mirage. <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, 47, is the majority shareholder of <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nugget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the Mirage. Sometimes he refers to the Mirage as `` the joint,'' a throwback to the jargon of another era when his father, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, dreamed of opening a bingo parlor in this growing gaming town. Other times he refers to the Mirage as an `` experience'' or a `` wonderment the world will flock to see.'' Guests arrive via a palm-lined entry that features a 54-foot volcano, three lagoons and waterfalls _ hardly your typical desert environment. The lagoons and waterfalls are fed by pipes that pump 100,000 gallons of water a minute. Valets whisk arriving cars into a labyrinth of tunnels under the resort. `` Just like a <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> movie, huh?'' <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> joked as his Mercedes whipped along the underground maze during a pre-opening tour. The top five floors of the 30-story resort contain 260 penthouse suites for coveted casino customers. And for his `` stratosphere'' players, <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> has six ground-level private bungalows, complete with their own swimming pools. The swimming pool is a quarter-mile around and nearby is a dolphin habitat approved by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Registering guests will find themselves facing a giant fish tank whose inhabitants include 4-foot sharks. `` The sharks will, of course, prompt a lot of bad jokes about what will happen if you do n't pay your markers,'' <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> laughed. The casino covers the space of two football fields, but will be broken up by thatched huts containing such operations as the cage, the pit and a bar to make the area appear more intimate. In one area of the casino, customers can play nickel slots and order pizza or pasta. Nearby, a small room provides `` stratosphere'' customers their own private casino, with $ 1,000 chips the smallest available. `` We'll let you gamble there as high as you've got the nerve,'' <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> promised. The hotel's 1,500-seat showroom will feature illusionists <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, who returned earlier this month from a tour of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and a stint at Radio City Music Hall in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The volcano and waterfalls in front of the Mirage are designed to block the view of other resorts across the Strip. `` I'm burned out on neon,'' said <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, whose Golden Nugget Hotel in downtown's Glitter Gulch is also void of any neon. `` I think it's cheap. To me, neon is yesterday Las Vegas.'' It was the neon that captivated <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> in 1952 when he came to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> with his father, who hoped to start a bingo parlor in the city. Old-time gaming figures blocked the elder <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, sending him and his son home to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, nursing busted dreams. <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> later returned to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, bought an interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, then bought stock in the Golden Nugget and eventually took control of the Nugget. <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> is confident his new property will be profitable, despite the high cost, saying it can earn the necessary $ 1 million a day. <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> said the high-rise came in on budget despite some guesswork on exotic frills. `` What we could not budget intelligently was the atrium, the volcanoes. There was no way of knowing those costs in advance. What do you do? Look under the Yellow Pages for volcanoes?'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s new 1,200-room Taj-Mahal in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is expected to cost $ 1.2 billion when completed next year. <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> says his Mirage would have cost $ 1.5 billion to build in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where construction costs are higher. <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, who's had off-and-on battles with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, said he wants to be known as a hotel operator, not `` the star.'' `` I want people to say that <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> built the best hotel in the world. I do n't want to say I own it. I want to be the guy that designed it. That's my edge.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, joining the ranks of Wall Street firms forced to cut back their payrolls in the face of high costs, will eliminate about 300 jobs by year end, a spokesman confirmed Thursday. A <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said over 100 people already have been let go from the firm's fixed-income and equities departments. The remaining cuts are expected to come from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate finance and junk bond operations. But unidentified sources cited in Thursday editions of the Wall Street Journal said employees are braced for cuts of up to 800. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman responded that he does n't `` see it getting up that high. The <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> dismissals follow similar moves begun earlier this week by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which began laying off employees in a cutback that could total 800 before 1990 begins. Wall Street firms, particularly retail brokerages catering to individual investors, have been under increasing pressure to trim costs in the face of rising operating expenses. Most firms are expected to show a decline in trading profits this year due to the stock market's October plunge and the general pressure on takeover stocks, which had been driving the market higher. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has begun charging customers a `` handling fee'' on all individual stock and bond trades. The firm is among the last of the major brokerages to do so, and a Bear, <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> spokesman indicated that the firm has not raised its commission fees in 20 years. The fee, which amounts to $ 2.50 per trade, is expected to cover costs and add about $ 1 million a year in income to the firm's balance sheet

 Royal <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, two of the world's largest oil companies, posted sharply lower third-quarter profits Thursday, hurt by sagging results in two main businesses <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION>, the world's second largest oil company behind <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said its net income for the three months ended Sept. 30, fell 16 percent to 652 million pounds, or $ 1.04 billion, compared with 778 million pounds, or $ 1.2 billion, in the same period a year ago. The company does not report consolidated per-share earnings. Revenue rose 12.5 percent to 16.2 billion pounds from 14.4 billion pounds in the comparable 1988 period. London-based <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said its net profit for the three months fell 34 percent to 211 million pounds compared with 318 million pounds a year ago. Revenue for the fourth-largest oil concern totaled 7.6 billion pounds, up 14 percent from 6.65 billion pounds in the same 1988 period. Both companies' chemicals businesses suffered due to lower demand and prices for chemical products, while refining and marketing results fell as refined product margins and sales volumes declined. The companies' financial statements are based on British accounting methods and can not be directly compared with those of most American companies. Inventories are valued on the basis of first in first out -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FIFO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, instead of the typical American system of last in first out -LRB- LIFO -RRB-. On the American basis, <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s third-quarter net income fell 20 percent to 667 million pounds, from 837 million pounds a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, said a 38 percent drop in chemicals earnings offset substantial gains in oil exploration and production. Refining and marketing results also slipped lower while corporate charges jumped 64 percent to 115 million pounds from 70 million pounds a year ago, the result of currency losses totaling 101 million pounds, more than triple year-earlier losses. For the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s net income advanced 31 percent to 2.93 billion pounds from 2.23 billion pounds. On the American basis, it rose 12 percent to 2.68 billion pounds from 2.4 billion pounds. Revenue gained 12 percent to 46.5 billion pounds from 41.6 billion pounds. British Petroleum's third-quarter profit on an American accounting basis fell 34 percent to 264 million pounds from 402 million pounds. Per share earnings came to 4.2 pence a share, or 7 cents, compared with 5.2 pence, or 8 cents in the comparable period last year. British Petroleum said higher crude oil prices only partially offset lower production and higher production costs and taxes. Chemicals earnings declined, reflecting weaker product demand, and refining and marketing results fell 29 percent as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> margins slipped. For the nine months, net profit amounted to 1.3 billion pounds compared with 938 million pounds in the year-earlier period. Revenue gained 10 percent to 21.6 billion pounds from 19.6 billion pounds. On an American basis, earnings totaled 1.02 billion pounds compared with 1.13 billion pounds. Earnings per share amounted to 23.5 pence compared with 15.5 pence.

 The <ORGANIZATION> May </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the country's leading retailers, on Thursday said its third-quarter income grew only slightly over last year's profit, which was boosted by an $ 18 million one-time gain. Specialty apparel retailer <ORGANIZATION> Gap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported its profit jumped 29 percent in the third quarter, helped by strong sales at its flagship stores and at GapKids. May earned $ 97 million, or 69 cents a share, in the three months ended Oct. 28 compared with $ 100 million, or 68 cents, in the comparable 1988 quarter. The $ 100 million from last year's third quarter contained a gain from May's sale of real estate and pre-payment of a long-term debt. Without that gain, net income would have been $ 82 million, or 56 cents a share. Sales for the quarter were $ 2.27 billion, up 9 percent from $ 2.08 billion in last year's third quarter. `` Sales maintained a good pace throughout the entire period and we are pleased with the results,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. `` We are well positioned for the important 1989 Christmas season.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its fourth-quarter earnings rose by 56 percent, reflecting strong attendance at its theme parks and booming results from its home video unit which had big sales on its release of the movie `` Bambi.'' Disney said its profit rose 35 percent for the year with big contributions from all of its main businesses, which include filmed entertainment, consumer products and theme parks and resorts. In filmed entertainment, for instance, the company had higher than expected profits from movies like `` Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' and `` Dead Poets Society.'' For the quarter ending Sept. 30, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 212.7 million, or $ 1.54 per share, compared to $ 136.4 million, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. Fourth-quarter revenue rose by 33 percent to $ 1.3 billion from $ 1 billion. For the fiscal year, net income was $ 703.3 million, or $ 5.10 per share, compared to $ 522 million, or $ 3.80 per share, last year. Full-year revenue climbed 34 percent to $ 4.6 billion from $ 3.4 billion. Operating income climbed 62 percent to $ 373 million for the quarter and 39 percent for the fiscal year to $ 1.2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> and president <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> noted in a statement that more people attended <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> theme parks than ever, and spent more on average. The new Disney-MGM Studios attraction in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was a major contributor to the sector's earnings, they said <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> was brought in to run Disney at the end of the fiscal year 1984, in which the company earned $ 98 million on revenues of $ 1.7 billion. Since then, annual revenues have increased at an average rate of 35 percent, profits are up sevenfold, and the stock is worth about eight times as much per share after adjusting for stock splits.

The Beatles, one of the most popular and prolific bands in the history of rock' n'roll, disbanded in 1970. In the formal statement <PERSON> Menon </PERSON> praised the group's contribution to music. `` The Beatles' recordings are a unique legacy in the history of popular music which <ORGANIZATION> EMI </ORGANIZATION> has been privileged to represent since 1962,'' <PERSON> Menon </PERSON> said. `` We are most delighted to have resolved all the differences which arose between us in recent years, and look forward to the continuation of our long standing and close relationship with the artists and Apple.'' The Beatles' <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> filed its first suit in 1979 against <ORGANIZATION> EMI </ORGANIZATION> and its <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, alleging the company underpaid royalties by not reporting the sale of 19 million records from 1969 to 1979. The group sought $ 50 million in damages. Apple also sued <ORGANIZATION> EMI </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, alleging it was delaying a release of Beatles material on compact discs, and also challenged royalty rates paid to individual group members. `` If they have indeed come to the end of the long and winding road, it's wonderful,'' said <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>. `` It's such a confusing myriad of issues that even people who have been close to the principals have a difficult time grasping it. `` A number of attorneys on both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> have probably put their children through college on this,'' <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON> said.

 A pair of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> employees who thought they had pulled off an undetectable theft were arrested in a parking lot trying to peddle discount computer parts to undercover officers. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetterer </PERSON>, 36, and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoeppe </PERSON>, 34, both of <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, were held Thursday at the Manatee County Jail on $ 10 million bail each. Circuit Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the high bond was justified by the value of the stolen goods and the suspects' extensive out-of-state contacts. The theft of $ 1.8 million in computer chips and other parts _ one of the biggest ever at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ began when <PERSON> Wetterer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shoeppe </PERSON> tried to take advantage of a glitch in inventory records, said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> region of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wetterer </PERSON>, a senior buyer who worked for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> for eight years, and <PERSON> Shoeppe </PERSON>, a cost engineer for 10 years, allegedly took the chips and tried to sell them at a reduced price, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. After lengthy negotiations, state undercover agents arranged to buy 910 parts from <PERSON> Wetterer </PERSON> and Shoeppe for $ 300,000 in the <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> parking lot, authorities said. Each faces two counts each of dealing in stolen property, grand larceny, grand theft and crimes against computers.

 Two major British banks, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday announced they were increasing their reserves to cover potential losses on loans made to developing countries. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said it was increasing specific provisions for loans made to problem countries by the equivalent of $ 1.9 billion to counter what it called a `` continued deterioration'' in the servicing of the debt. Later, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> announced it added a further $ 914 million to its specific provisions for lending to 27 countries with repayment difficulties. In the third quarter, major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks took similar measures to bolster their protection against losses amid widespread perception that economic and political difficulties in the Third World might make it impossible for countries to repay their debt. The additional provisions will lift <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION>' cover on medium - and long-term debt to problem countries to 85 percent of its $ 5.7 billion exposure <PERSON> Natwest </PERSON> said the new provisions would raise its overall level of cover on its $ 3.5 billion of exposure to 72 percent.

<HEAD>Wang Announces `Reordering' of Business, Layoff of 2,000</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The president of <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, declaring computers no longer represent a boom industry, announced Thursday his company would undergo a `` fundamental reordering'' and cut 2,000 more workers from its payroll. The cutback was the latest sign of a high-tech industry slowdown that has contributed to a softening of the region's economy. `` Some fundamental things are happening that will drive all -LRB- computer -RRB- companies to do things differently or they will fail,'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> president <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was named president of <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> in August, succeeding <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, who had been ousted from the job by <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, his father, company founder and chairman. Prior to Thursday's announcement, the company already had cut about 5,000 jobs this year and announced plans to sell $ 200 million in assets. Furthermore, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> reported a first quarter loss of $ 62.1 million in the first quarter that ended Sept. 30, and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> predicted more losses for the second quarter. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said under the company's new approach, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> will cut its bureaucracy to get in closer touch with the needs of its customers. `` We are eliminating the layers between the field and laboratory,'' he said. `` We will eliminate entire functions _ functions that I view as stifling.'' For example, he said, the company's product development programs often duplicate efforts, with no single group taking responsibility. As a result, products often have been introduced late. But <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said departments will be combined, leading to a streamlined approach. The reorganization of the company will mean the loss of about 2,000 by Jan. 1, lowering the Wang workforce to just over 22,000, he said. About 1,000 of the layoffs will occur in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, mostly at the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>, with the rest being scattered around the world. A severance package for these employees will result in a onetime charge of $ 30 million in the company's second quarter, which ends Dec. 31. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the restructuring announced Thursday would cut annual costs by about $ 115 million, but he stressed that the company was not simply calculating how much needed to be cut in order to be profitable. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> high-tech industry has suffered other setbacks. <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced last month it would eliminate 2,200 jobs, and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> recently offered voluntary severance to 700 workers. `` I think restructuring is becoming a common word in this industry,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said much of <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s bureaucracy grew while the high-tech industry was booming. But now the industry has reached a `` maturing'' stage with slower growth, he said. The bureaucracy `` just built up because of the luxury of very big margins in a high growth industry,'' he said. But while <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> pointed to the fluctuations in the computer industry for many of his company's problems, analysts said some of the trouble _ particularly poor customer service _ has been unique to <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>. `` They have had this problem with service and support for a long time,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendler </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is a breath of fresh air.'' Also, <PERSON> Wendler </PERSON> said, after the company completes the cost-cutting measures, `` the hemorrhaging, financially, will stop.'' `` A lot of <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> customers have the shakes right now,'' he said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Elling </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fenner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said during the 1970s and early 1980s, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> did not pay attention to customer service because it became confident as a leader in word processing equipment. `` They had something everyone wanted,'' he said. `` People were willing to put up with poorer service.'' `` <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was too slow to recognize they needed to change,'' he said. Part of the change, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, will include more focus on software and other computer applications. `` Most customers are not crying for new technology,'' he said. `` They are crying for new applications of technology.''

<HEAD>Government Withdraws Nuclear Plants From Electricity Privatization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Thursday it would withdraw nuclear plants from the planned privatization of the nation's electricity industry Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakeham </PERSON>, speaking in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, said the move was necessary to ensure the public sale of the industry is held before the next national elections, which must be called by mid-1992. <PERSON> Wakeham </PERSON> said high costs associated with nuclear energy also were a key factor in the decision to keep the plants under government control. The electricity privatization, which had been expected to raise up to $ 43 billion, would be the largest yet under Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s successful program. Since the privatization program began, the government has sold billions of dollars worth of state-owned companies _ including <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> _ to promote capitalism. But the electricity sale and the planned sell-off of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s water industry are highly controversial Opponents say such vital utilities, particularly nuclear plants, should stay in state hands for security reasons. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 18 existing nuclear plants will be placed under the control of a government-owned company after the government privatizes their current parent, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electricity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wakeham </PERSON> said. The overall plan involves breaking up the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electricity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> into privately held generating companies called <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gen </ORGANIZATION> and into a single distribution company called <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>'s president on Thursday argued for freer airline travel in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, saying it should be liberalized in the same way as trade between the two nations. `` We'd like to have a greater presence here in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeanniot </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s largest airline. `` Let's not exclude air travel out of free trade. We should work towards integrating this air market.'' Air travel was excluded from the historic free-trade agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> which took effect at the beginning of this year. <PERSON> Jeanniot </PERSON> said Canadian airlines should be given rights of cabotage in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers should be accorded the same rights in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Under cabotage, which is not currently allowed, airlines would be permitted to carry passengers between two cities within a foreign country. Air Canada would be able to fly, for example, between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, while now it can only operate between those cities and Canadian destinations. Likewise, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier such as <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> could carry Canadian passengers between <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Other airline executives, such as <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, have recently advocated cabotage for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European carriers to help cope with the growing globalization of world air travel <PERSON> Jeanniot </PERSON>, speaking to a small group of reporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the freer U.S.-Canada air ties could become part of a wider liberalization including European and Asian airlines. `` If we -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> -RRB- ca n't bring it about, what's the hope for the rest of the world?'' he asked. <PERSON> Jeanniot </PERSON> suggested that, to alleviate government fears, the granting of cabotage rights by the two countries could be started on a limited basis, perhaps as an experiment for a year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian airlines could start by flying between foreign cities from which they already operate, he said. `` I do n't want to be <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>; I do n't want to fly everywhere in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. While the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> government has shown itself to be `` quite progressive'' about the issue of cabotage, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration appears to be concerned about potential internal competition from low-cost Asian airlines, <PERSON> Jeanniot </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 As takeovers and expansion attempts make cash flow even more important to airline executives, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> tried Thursday to come up with a strategy to secure higher pay and job security for their members. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianchi-Sand </PERSON>, president of the 27,000-member union, said its board of directors is focusing on short-range planning because of what is happening in the airline industry. Recent events include <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, pursuing a buyout or recapitalization of the nation's second-largest carrier; <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> struggling to make a comeback in the face of an eight-month-old strike; and a number of airlines, including <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, battling to increase service to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> `` We will be going to the table with newer and stronger proposals for job security,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bianchi-Sand </PERSON>, whose union represents flight attendants on 18 airlines, including <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will want guarantees that the contract stays intact if a company is bought.'' Flight attendants' pay has fallen at carriers that have been hard pressed by competition, she noted. In recent years, attendants have accepted pay cuts of as much as 20 percent to help carriers such as <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to survive. Republic and Western have since been merged into larger carriers, while <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> recently filed for bankruptcy reorganization for the second time in seven years. Also forcing down salaries has been two-tier wage scales, with new flight attendants accepting starting salaries far below those given their senior colleagues. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, an airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Howe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, noted that salary for B-scale attendants is $ 950 a month, and that most contracts call for flight attendants to remain at the lower scale for five years. `` The attendants will be trying to cut the B scale from five years to three years'' in future negotiations, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. But that will be a difficult task because of airline expansion plans and takeover activity, he said. Last year, most major airlines had strong profits, with Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> showing a $ 476 million profit and Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> $ 372 million. `` The airlines are trying to cut their costs,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. `` And they think that the only way they can keep expanding is buying new airplanes. And the only way they can do that is a strong cash flow.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bianchi-Sand </PERSON> said her <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based union also will emphasize the issue of flight attendant health in future negotiations with the carriers. `` There are issues of reproductive concerns because of radioactive cargo, and cabin air quality apart from the smoking issue,'' she said. Fumes are generated by cabin materials, Ms. <PERSON> Bianchi-Sand </PERSON> said, and flight attendants are plagued by back problems caused by pushing food carts that weigh more than 200 pounds. Perhaps one of the most difficult tasks for the union is reaching a contract with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> for its 14,000 flight attendants. Following the failure of a $ 6.75 billion takeover effort by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s top management, its pilots union and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the attendants demanded a resumption of the federal mediation that was suspended in August due to the buyout efforts. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants joined the buyout bid in its latter stages, a move Ms. <PERSON> Bianchi-Sand </PERSON> described as primarily a protective strategy. `` We felt it was better to be part of the process instead of letting someone else determine the fate of the airline,'' she said. Resuming contract talks could lead to a walkout if the negotiations are as unsuccessful as they have been for the past two years, union officials say. `` They had enormous demands for concessions that did not fit reality,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bianchi-Sand </PERSON>. `` They were seeking work rule and benefit concessions that were not acceptable to membership.'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> says he believes flight attendants' negotiators will find their work more difficult as airlines continue to cut costs to maximize profits. `` In the future, you will see a situation of 10-year contracts for flight attendants,'' he said. `` Attendants will be allowed to work 10 years only, there will no longer be attendants working for years beyond that. The unions will fight that hard.''

 The dollar rose Thursday against most major currencies except the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar. Gold prices fell. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid for gold at 4 p.m. EST of $ 386.30 a troy ounce, down from $ 387.50 late Wednesday. Dealers said the dollar had little reaction to a larger-than-expected 0.4 percent rise in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wholesale prices in October. Analysts had expected an increase in the Producer Price Index of 0.2 percent. `` You saw most of the market react rather subdued to the PPI report,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ethridge </PERSON>, vice president of foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was n't a shock.'' Currency traders said the dollar remained strong despite the market's perception that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is relaxing its credit policy, which likely would encourage lower interest rates. Falling interest rates usually depress the dollar's value. The key factor was selling between other currencies that pushed down the dollar vs. the Japanese yen, said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brussels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said the yen rose against the West German mark and also gained ground against the dollar in the morning. The selloff ran out of steam when the dollar hit 142.25 yen and traders bought dollars in an afternoon rally, traders said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 142.70 Japanese yen, down 0.27 yen from Wednesday's close. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 142.85 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 143.13, down from 143.18 late Wednesday. <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> said the dollar rose against the British pound because the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern that pressure to increase wages could lead to a recession. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound edged up to $ 1.5863 from $ 1.5860 late Wednesday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fetched $ 1.5823, less than $ 1.5885 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8523 West German marks, up from 1.8445; 1.6250 Swiss francs, up from 1.6168; 6.2810 French francs, up from 6.2515; 1,354.25 Italian lire, up from 1,347.25; and 1.1670 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1698.

<HEAD>Money Supply Mixed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply were mixed in the week ended Oct. 30, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose by $ 3.1 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,181.1 billion from a revised $ 3,178.0 billion the previous week. But an even broader measure, M3, fell $ 700 million to a seasonally adjusted $ 4,033.2 billion from $ 4,033.9 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell $ 2.2 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 786.6 billion from $ 788.8 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The growth rate in M2 over the past 52 weeks has been 4.0 percent, which is within the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3 percent to 7 percent. The growth rate in M3 over the same period has been 4.0 percent, also within the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,156.3 billion, an 8.2 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 4,017.3 billion, up 4.0 percent, while M1 rose 4.5 percent to an average of $ 782.3 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 186 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from $ 289 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 293.2 billion in the two-week period ended Nov. 1, down from $ 293.7 billion two weeks earlier

<HEAD>Copper Prices Continue to Surge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Copper prices continued their surge Thursday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid investors' concerns over labor conditions in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> On other markets, grain was mostly lower and soybeans higher; energy and sugar futures were higher; gold was off while silver gained and livestock and pork futures were mixed. Copper settled .70 cent to 1.35 cents higher with the contract for delivery in November at $ 1.1640 a pound. Miners at <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s four largest mines have voted to strike if the government adopts a law that would reorganize state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Chile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The proposal would give members of the military government power over mine operations after the government leaves office and reduce the power of unions. Helping to boost prices was the perception the metal had been oversold in recent weeks because of settlement of labor disputes in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said analyst <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Expectations that Monday's report on stocks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Metal Exchange-approved warehouses will show a decline also helped prices, as did prospects that interest rates are going down, which would increase demand, <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said. Grain futures were mostly lower and soybeans were higher in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Trading in corn and soybeans was subdued as investors awaited the release of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s latest crop report. The report, released after the close of trading, estimated the 1989 corn harvest at 7.59 billion bushels, up 54 percent from last year's drought-shriveled crop. The estimate was up 2 percent from prospects a month ago when the department estimated this year's production at 7.45 billion bushels Soybean production, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable oil, was estimated at 1.94 billion bushels, up 25 percent from last year's harvest of 1.54 billion bushels and 1 percent above the October estimate of 1.93 billion bushels. Wheat prices were forced lower due to a lack of export business, although some support was received from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s six - to 10-day forecast, which calls for dry weather in winter wheat crop areas Wheat was a -LCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cent lower with December at $ 4.03 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with December at $ 2.36 -LCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 \ cent higher with December at $ 1.42 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 -LCB- cents to 4 -RCB- cents higher with November at $ 5.67 -RCB- a Precious metals futures were mixed in active trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> as investors in gold decided to take profits and invest in silver. Over the past three days, gold increased in value by $ 10, and a correction was overdue, said <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON>. He noted that silver has had minor changes in value, trading up or down in a minor range until Thursday when traders bailed out of gold and bought silver in the expectation its price would go up. Gold settled $ 1.80 lower with December at $ 389 a troy ounce; silver was 1.3 cents to 1.7 cents higher with December at $ 5.308 a troy ounce. Sugar prices rose on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, Sugar and <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on technical factors and continued concern that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> will not meet its export obligations. Prices also were boosted by reports the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may increase its import quotas, which would be a boost to the world market, said analyst <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Badenhop </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Sugar was .16 cent to .21 cent higher with January at 15.01 cents a pound. Energy futures climbed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 5 cents to 20 cents higher with December at $ 19.92 a barrel; heating oil was .20 cent to .50 cent higher with December at 58.92 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .35 cent to .71 cent higher with December at 52.22 a gallon. Livestock prices were up and pork futures were lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle was .13 cent to .35 cent higher with December at 74.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .40 cent higher with November at 83.17 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .30 cent lower with December at 47.52 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .30 cent to 1.30 cent lower with February at 63.17 cents a pound.

 <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> A.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> shrugs off the suggestion that his company's $ 1.7 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reflects an aggressive campaign to acquire electric utilities across the West. `` I guess we do n't consider ourselves aggressive. We consider ourselves people who are willing to act on logical opportunities,'' <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> said Thursday, a day <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> offered to buy <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s largest utility from troubled <ORGANIZATION> Pinnacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, already is the third-largest utility in the West, serving 1.2 million electric customers in seven Western <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would give it some 1.8 million electric customers in eight states and annual revenue from electrical operations of about $ 3.6 billion. <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> still would fall far short of the electric revenue generated by the West's two largest utilities, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rosemead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The move to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> comes less than a year after <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s successful 17-month campaign to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>. It is the latest in a long line of carefully considered acquisitions that have built <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> into a $ 3.5 billion company over the last 35 years. With the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> doubled its electrical revenues and customer base, pushing earnings from electrical operations to 73 percent of its $ 3.5 billion overall revenue. The balance of <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings come from <ORGANIZATION> NERCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a mining and development company; <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a telephone company; and <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Profitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> attracted the attention of <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> executives when Pinnacle West announced it might file for bankruptcy because of losses from its <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. In announcing the cash offer, <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> said acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would broaden the benefits realized by customers and shareholders in the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> would furnish power to meet peak demand in the summer in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would do the same in the winter, when demand peaks in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> said. With the cost of constructing new power plants sky high, he said, the deal would create the equivalent of a major generating plant. <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s history of acquisition and diversification dates to 1954, when <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s president <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKee </PERSON> engineered the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The deal gave <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> more customers in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> outside the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> area, along with new customers in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. In 1961, a merger with <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> doubled <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>'s electrical business again. Meanwhile, the company built a business from the two small telephone companies it acquired along with <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` What we did in the area of diversification was not set out to diversify, but rather we took assets that we had within the enterprise and built on them,'' <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> said. `` In the 1954 electric merger we acquired two small telephone properties. We used them as the growth vehicle to build <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>. `` By the mid -'70s,'' he said, `` we had made coal sales from our coal holdings which we originally acquired for power plant We ended up with more proven reserves than we needed for power plant purposes, so we started selling coal. So <ORGANIZATION> NERCO </ORGANIZATION> then grew out of that coal sales activity and our ability to mine coal for our own purposes.'' <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> relies on coal for 65 percent of its electrical generating capacity, with hydroelectric power providing 15 percent. A merger with <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would reduce PacfiCorp's dependence on coal and hydroelectric power, but increase its reliance on nuclear power from about 0.3 percent to nearly 10 percent The deal also would position <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> to serve lucrative markets in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Belosic </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <PERSON> Belosic </PERSON> said the key to success in electric utilities is expanding generating capacity without spending enormous amounts of money on new plant construction. <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> simply sees the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> deal as an opportunity the company could not pass up, <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> said. `` It developed, we felt it had value, so we reacted,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> may reactivate some of the beleagured carrier's grounded fleet while continuing to seek a buyer, a company official said Thursday. A skeletal group of executives are considering expanding the Orlando-based carrier's charter services, leasing some of its aircraft or establishing some kind of maintenance operation, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Volz </PERSON>, senior vice president for marketing. `` We're formulating a realistic business plan,'' said <PERSON> Volz </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> dismissed most of its remaining 1,800 employees after shutting down its 46 daily flight schedule shortly after midnight Monday. After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Sept. 28, the carrier drastically cut back flights and laid off nearly 2,900 workers. <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said 200 to 300 employees were still working Thursday, including some 50 administrative people in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and more than 150 in an accounting department in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, the carrier's former headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> and Chief Financial Officer <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackinnon </PERSON> have been trying to negotiate a possible $ 100 million sale to investors led by securities expert <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Latshaw </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>IMF Director Optimistic About Mexico Debt, Urges Faith in Brady Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday he is optimistic about <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s ability to pay some of its debt, mainly because of his faith in the program under which the size of the country's debt is being reduced. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said the so-called <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan to reduce the debt of Third World nations is working, albeit slowly. For <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, a committee representing more than 400 banks was formed to deal with $ 52 billion of that country's debt. The banks were given a choice of reducing the total, reducing interest rates, making new loans or some combination of the three. `` As far as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is concerned, I am optimistic of their ability,'' <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> told reporters. `` Not only because the answer of the banks is positive in general, but because the program is so high-quality and because the program is being implemented thoughtfully.'' <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, who was visiting <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to speak at a private dinner held by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> and to meet with former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, defended the debt reduction program devised by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and urged critics to give it time to work. `` I think the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan is an extremely important and positive part of the debt strategy,'' he said. `` It is just starting working. It remains to be seen if it will be a full success or a partial one. `` What I have seen so far is quite encouraging,'' said <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, whose organization is funded by 152 industrialized nations. For the strategy to work, he said, it will take full cooperation from commercial banks, creditor countries and the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said he was opposed to tinkering with the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan, and disagreed with a banking group that on Wednesday called on creditor governments to reduce debts owed them by `` middle income'' debtor nations. <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulmann </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>, said creditor governments should negotiate delays in repayments of loans owed to them, stretching them out beyond 10 years. <PERSON> Schulmann </PERSON>, whose organization represents 150 banks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said such help has been given to the poorest nations, and now should be extended to others. Said <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>: `` I'm not in favor of a permanent process of change of the strategy. I understand very well the very good intention and probably the good analytical reasons of Mr. <PERSON> Schulmann </PERSON>. `` But we have just launched a few months ago the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> strategy. We're just in the process of implementing that.'' To rethink that strategy now, he said, would be `` the most efficient way of organizing its failure.'' In remarks prepared for his Thursday night speech, <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> stressed the importance of reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation and increasing the nation's savings rate. `` The world economy can only take full advantage of the increased sense of international responsibility among major industrial countries if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains its commitment to play its part in fostering conditions favorable to worldwide economic prosperity,'' he said.

<HEAD>TWA Posts Loss for Third Fiscal Quarter, Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it lost $ 29.9 million in its third fiscal quarter, citing higher interest expenses associated with the privatization of the carrier last year and higher operating costs. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by takeover specialist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and based in this <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suburb, said its loss for the three months ended Sept. 30 contrasted with a profit of $ 88 million for the quarter a year earlier. The results a year ago included a one-time gain of an unspecified amount from litigation between <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and the estate of the late <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a previous owner. The latest figures fail to reflect about $ 98 million in unrealized gains in <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s investment portfolio, the airline said Revenue in the quarter was virually unchanged at $ 1.27 billion. The nation's sixth-largest carrier said its operating profit tumbled to $ 60.7 million in the latest quarter from $ 141 million a year earlier. It said its operating expenses climbed to $ 1.21 billion from $ 1.13 billion because of the expiration of concessions previously granted by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, general salary increases, fuel price increases and increased costs due to improvements in trans-Atlantic service. For the first nine months of the fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> said it lost $ 117.3 million in contrast to a profit of $ 132.7 million a year earlier. Nine-month revenue rose 4 percent to $ 3.48 billion from $ 3.33 billion a year earlier. Though <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> is privately owned, it reports its earnings because it has publicly traded bonds.

<HEAD>Allegheny International Scraps Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday scrapped its latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection after <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> withdrew its commitment to provide $ 400 million in financing. The small-appliance maker said at a hearing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> it would revert to a previously filed backup plan that would repay virtually all creditors in new stock. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosetti </PERSON> pledged to force lawyers to work through the weekend to get an amended form of the stock plan ready for a vote by creditors even if no alternative source of bank financing can be found quickly. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that a group that reportedly included shaving king <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiam </PERSON> has offered to buy Allegheny for $ 683.8 million. <PERSON> Kiam </PERSON> would become the new chief executive under the proposal made by <ORGANIZATION> Japonica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm, sources familiar with the deal told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> made an offer for <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> in July and put more substance behind the bid Wednesday in a letter to <PERSON> Allegheny </PERSON>'s board The July offer gave no indication of how the bid would be financed or how the reorganized company would be operated. At Thursday's hearing, lawyers for <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> and its major creditors said they did not put much credence in the <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> proposal. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON>, a lawyer for <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION>, said the company's board is `` not going to waste a lot of time on it.'' <PERSON> Cosetti </PERSON> called <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON>'s offer `` almost impertinent'' and said it would not hold up consideration of management's newest plan. The skepticism stems from doubts about whether <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> could raise the money it says it is willing to pay for <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> made its offer in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION> Steinhardt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> money management firm. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> said it was confident of lining up financing from several banks, none of which was identified. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON> contended its bid is more sensibly financed than Allegheny management's plan. All but $ 53 million of the $ 683.8 million price would be paid in cash. Unlike <PERSON> Allegheny </PERSON>'s latest plan, <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON>'s would not use high-yield, high-risk debt securities known as junk bonds. On a different front, <PERSON> Kiam </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Remington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>' president and pitchman, has recently worked on a possible bid for <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> in conjunction with the equity committee in the company's bankruptcy case. That effort is not related to <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON>'s offer, according to <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Blu </PERSON>, the lead lawyer for the equity committee. <PERSON> Kiam </PERSON> was out of town Thursday and not immediately available for comment, his secretary said. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> previously expressed concern that the management plan contained too little equity, but it had given no indication it would withdraw its financing. Allegheny has been operating under Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection since February 1988. Last month it filed two alternate plans to emerge from bankruptcy. The company has filed several plans in its efforts to reorganize but has met consistent opposition from creditors and shareholders. Its debts currently total about $ 500 million.

<HEAD>Red Cross Cancels Blood Drive at Eastern Airlines After Threat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> canceled a blood drive last month for non-striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees after, officials said, union members threatened to halt future donations. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerly </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> corporate communications in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the organization canceled its Oct. 27 blood drive at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s reservations office in <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION> after union officials urged them not to cross picket lines. She said 50 units of blood were expected to be collected during the drive. `` We were told -LRB- by <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> officials -RRB- that if we went ahead with the drive we could expect further problems from other unions,'' she said. `` Faced with the potential of such a significant loss of its donor base, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> decided to cancel the blood drive,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Ackerly </PERSON> said union workers donate 40,000 units of blood or one-fifth of all blood donations to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>' 82-county region in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, said he asked <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials last month to stop the blood drive. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said union organizers would not have objected to non-striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers donating at the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> office `` on neutral ground.'' `` We are in no way trying to keep anyone from giving blood to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Eastern workers have been on strike since March, sending the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.

<HEAD>Former Federal Reserve Chairman Volcker Says No Recession Ahead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said he does n't foresee a recession in the near future, but warned that Americans should re-examine their habits of overspending and dependence on foreign capital. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, who oversaw the nation's monetary policy under the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administrations, pointed to the recent Japanese acquisitions of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> and Firestone Tire as warning signals. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been lending us a lot of money and buying a lot of our companies,'' <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said. `` It has financed a large part of our deficit. It has also permitted our consumption to proceed.'' <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, now chairman of the <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfensohn </PERSON> investment banking firm, was in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> to speak at <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham-Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said the nation's economy will likely continue its current seven-year expansion, the longest peacetime growth period. He noted that the unemployment rate has hit a 15-year low, prices are stable and inflation is remaining steady at about 4 percent. `` The chances are good, in fact, that we will avoid a recession in the next year, and if we play our cards right, we may have an expansion for years to come,'' <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said. Despite his optimistic forecast, the former policy-maker warned that the economy's built-in risks _ the federal and trade deficits, reliance on foreign capital and a low savings rate _ continue to threaten growth. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, was a sign of problems in the economic system but that investors did not heed the warning and continue to shrug off the twin deficits. With a higher savings rate, Americans could finance more of the economy themselves, he said. `` There are more risks than usual in our economy,'' he said. `` They are pretty well known.''

 Star Tribune newsroom employees approved a six-year contract Wednesday night, hours after their second strike deadline in as many days, but union leaders could find little positive to say about the deal. Guild Chairwoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON> said the vote was 233-70. A lack of support from other unions at plant helped spur the reluctant membership to accept the contract after several hours of discussion, union leaders said. `` It's a bad deal. It's a rotten deal,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, vice chairman of the negotiating committee. But Guild members feared they would be replaced in a prolonged strike, he said. `` We could have struck, but without the other unions it would have been extremely difficult,'' said strike coordinator <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, who characterized the contract as `` punitive.'' `` It simply does n't meet the needs of people trying to keep their standard of living intact,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenton </PERSON> said the newspaper was `` back to work as usual.'' `` We had hoped from the very beginning that we were able to reach a fair and equitable settlement and we're pleased that we've done that,'' she said <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said the contract covers six years and includes bonuses in each of the first three years, and pay raises of 3.2 percent in the fourth year, 3.1 percent in the fifth year and 3.0 percent in the sixth year. For top scale reporters, photographers, copy editors and district circulation managers, the bonuses would be $ 2,000 in the first year, $ 1,750 in the second and $ 1,500 in the third, <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said. The pay raises for top-scale employees would amount to about $ 26 a week in each of the last three years, he said. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said the package averages out to a 1.6 percent annual increase in pay scales over six years. He called it `` worse by far'' than the recent deal struck by <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> employees at the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>. Supervisors worked on scaled-down editions of Thursday's paper until union members returned at about 10:15 p.m., <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said. The union's original strike deadline was 4 p.m. Tuesday, but that was extended to 4 p.m. Wednesday. As the deadline passed, union negotiators said they were waiting for the company's response to a new offer they had made. Other provisions of the tentative pact as described by <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> include: _ Six employees would be removed from Guild jurisdiction, rather than the 26 originally proposed by the company _ Mileage would increase 1 cent a mile, to 22 cents; the Guild had sought an increase to 28 cents Union members have been working without a contract since their three-year pact expired July 31. The <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> unit covers about 300 newsroom employees and about 60 circulation and promotion workers. Under the old contract, top minimum weekly salaries for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> members have been $ 315.50 for copy aides; $ 742.50 for circulation district managers; $ 812 for reporters, photographers, copy editors and promotion personnel; and $ 895.75 for some editors, the Guild said.
