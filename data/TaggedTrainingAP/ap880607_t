<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is considering withholding governmental benefits such as student loans and public housing assistance to people convicted of drug use, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet-level </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, headed by Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, approved the proposals in outline form at a meeting May 27, but they have not yet been presented to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Wednesday's editions, citing sources it did not identify. `` We're not trying to be Draconian _ we're not going to kick poor people out of public housing ...,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted one source as saying. `` But at the same time, we're trying to encourage'' state and local governments and colleges to adopt anti-drug programs that will have `` maximum impact.'' The proposals would seek to fight drug abuse by threatening to withhold some federal aid to state and local governments, colleges and universities and other publicly funded institutions that fail to adopt strict, federally approved anti-drug programs, the sources said. One proposal calls for state governments to refuse to issue first-time drivers' licenses to minors who have been convicted of drug use, and the federal government would enforce this by threatening to withhold federal transportation funding, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. Various federal department and agencies were directed to study the proposals and report back to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by Wednesday, the newspaper said. One source told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that no objections had been raised and that the proposals probably would be presented to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> within the next few days.

 Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> staged what was to have been a celebratory appeal for votes on the final night of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary campaign, but the half-hour show was botched when the presidential candidate got stuck in traffic and missed half of it. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> arrived 16 minutes into the half-hour broadcast, which originated at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> station <ORGANIZATION> KTLA </ORGANIZATION> and shown throughout the state at a cost of $ 150,000. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> fell behind schedule on campaign appearances in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earlier in the the day, then got tied up in traffic jams trying to get to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> airport. The show opened with rock disc jockey <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasem </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter, announcing that the chair next to him was empty because <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was on his way. The first half of the show was given over to a video montage of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign appearances. <PERSON> Kasem </PERSON> filled time waiting for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by interviewing <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s state campaign manager, producing some tortured exchanges. Then came a second video montage, featuring some of the same footage already shown. Finally, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appeared. The candidate, appearing calm but his face glistening with perspiration, talked about the issues that he has stressed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ offshore oil drilling and environmental concerns as well as devoting defense funding to peaceful application in space and science instead. He also highlighted his anti-drug message and his call for an end to gang warfare. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told <PERSON> Kasem </PERSON> he had a `` day of big crowds, lots of excitement, but mostly of touching people's hearts.'' Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, shifting the focus toward thd Democratic convention this summer, said Monday he will go to the convention mat with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> unless the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner comes around to his position on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of proceeding too `` cautiously and conservatively'' in refusing to agree with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> should be declared a terrorist nation. `` If he will not bend on that matter, we'll simply meet on the floor at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said during a call-in radio news conference. The tough talk was the most pointed language <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has used in discussing his intentions for the convention. `` The matter needs to be resolved in the committee or in platform hearings or on the convention floor,'' he told reporters later. He indicated he will put up a fight for his platform issues but will do so within the framework of party rules, leaving unclear just how hard a bargain he will drive. `` We can resolve our differences within the context of our party and not in the streets _ and that's growth,'' he said at one point. He also said that at the convention he would `` use the rules to have fair rules'' _ a reference to his contention that the popular vote is not fairly reflected in the delegate count and so delegate-selection procedures should be changed. As for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> contends the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should subject that nation to the trade sanctions applied to other countries it has put on its terrorist list such as <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` By any definition of a terrorist state <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> qualifies,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the Democratic convention `` will have a tremendous impact on the priorities that the ticket will have. I'm convinced the ticket will take a strong position against apartheid and declare <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to be a terrorist state.'' As to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said, `` Either the governor will offer leadership on these basic issues or be wallowing in the wave of the convention taking him out to sea.'' `` It's not a question of integrity, it's a question of judgment and priorities. And the governor, like all of us, will keep expanding and keep growing,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> indicated he will push for platform planks on cutting back military spending and on shifting spending to housing, health care and other social services. Although polls have shown <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> consistently trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the state `` can produce an upset tomorrow if voters listen to their convictions rather than reports of an inevitable <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> win.'' In a philosophical vein, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he believes his candidacy has helped <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> grow in racial tolerance. `` It's clear <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has become more and more accustomed to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as a possible next president. ... It's a matter of growth. I'm the stimulus. I'm the catalyst for that growth.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sonnette </PERSON>, a rare French donkey who narrowly escaped a government death sentence four years ago, is expecting its first offspring. `` She looks like she swallowed a barrel. She looks like she wants to have it any minute,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderlip </PERSON>, who owns the donkey with her husband, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderlip </PERSON>. The Vanderlips, both veterinarians at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Sonnette </PERSON> successfully mated with a 3-year-old of the same breed about a year ago and should deliver her first foal later this month. Sonnette is one of four donkeys the Vanderlips imported to their northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> farm from the <LOCATION> Poitou </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1984 and 1985. In 1984, federal agriculture inspectors almost put <PERSON> Sonnette </PERSON>, a member of an endangered species, to death because the donkey failed an equine blood test for communicable diseases. A public outcry ensued over the plans to destroy the animal, and officials changed their mind when the Vanderlips and other experts showed the test given was n't suitable for a specialized variety such as the Poitou donkey. A test designed for the rare donkey was then given to <LOCATION> Sonnette </LOCATION> and it was released from quarantine after being certified as healthy and free of disease. Since then, the <PERSON> Vanderlips </PERSON> have imported three other rare Poitou donkeys, including the father-to-be, <LOCATION> Tartarin </LOCATION>. The Vanderlips hope to establish a herd to help the save the breed from extinction. About 45 Poitou donkeys remain in existence, said Mrs. <PERSON> Vanderlip </PERSON>, who learned about the species while studying veterinary medicine in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> several years ago. <PERSON> Sonnette </PERSON> has been separated from the other donkeys and will remain alone with the foal until the baby is weaned at 4 months to 6 months of age. <PERSON> Tartarin </PERSON> also will be kept away from <LOCATION> Sonnette </LOCATION> as well as the foal because male donkeys can become agitated around small creatures and may even kill them, Mrs. <PERSON> Vanderlip </PERSON> said.

 Rising ocean levels will flood cities and the climate will become hotter and more stormy unless governments curb gas emissions that make the Earth an ever-warming greenhouse, a group of scientists said. `` The problem here is 10 times or maybe 100 times more important and more difficult'' than the thinning ozone layer, said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The group Monday issued a report calling for coordinated planning to prepare coastal defenses against floods, stop deforestation, re-examine energy policies, cooperate to monitor and study emissions, and to carry out the accord to halt the depletion of the ozone layer recently signed in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. The report said weather changes will make deserts hotter and tropical storms more severe in the next few decades. It said rising seas will threaten to flood coastal cities like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and endanger entire countries like the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON> said the scientists could not establish how the weather changes would hit specific areas, but it was clear that `` climatic problems will be part of people's lives over the next century.'' The study was a follow-up to a 1985 conference of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Villach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, which endorsed the theory that gases trap energy from the sun near the Earth's surface, warming the atmosphere in a `` greenhouse effect.'' `` We are entering a new phase. We told the world what scientists believe will be the case ... Now nations and politicians must start to think about the problems,'' said <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON>, whose pioneering work on the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer earned him this year's $ 150,000 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> The report said the earth's average temperature will rise by at least 0.54 to 1.44 degrees Fahrenheit per decade. In the tropics and in the polar regions, the rise in temperature may reach as much as 9 degrees, the report said. The rising temperatures will melt polar ice packs in summer, raising the sea level by 8 to 60 inches over the next 50 years, the report said. At least 30 of the world's largest cities `` definitely will be affected,'' said <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Beijer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, who wrote the report. In the last 100 years the earth's average temperature has risen nine-tenths of a degree and sea level has risen by four to 4.8 inches, she said. Even if emissions of dangerous gases were stopped immediately, temperatures and the sea level would continue to rise at that rate for another 100 years because of those gases already released in the atmosphere, she said. The report said that among the effects, tropical storms will become more frequent and hit wider areas. Patterns of rainfall, and thus farming, will change. Fish migrations will shift. Evaporation will increase, making water supplies scarcer in semi-arid zones. Trees and animals may have difficulty reproducing and may be threatened with extinction. <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON> said more powerful storms could cause severe flooding in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, threating the lives or dislocation of 50 million people. Floods could overwhelm the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, where 10 million Egyptians live. `` Roughly half of humanity lives close to the sea,'' she said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alone will have to spend up to $ 100 billion to protect its eastern seaboard, she said. The changing climate also will have military implications as seas become ice-free along the northern coasts of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. `` If these coastlines become navigable, fundamental security readjustments will be required,'' the report said. The report listed the `` greenhouse gases'' as carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons, nitrous oxide and tropospheric ozone.

 The dean of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> has resigned two months after his selection and three months before classes are scheduled to begin, according to a published report. `` It was the most agonizing decision of my career,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> for a story in Tuesday's editions. `` My wife and family decided they really did n't want to move.

 Crews filming scenes for a movie about bat-wielding principal <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> have disrupted classes and graduation plans, but some students said the film also has generated excitement. `` They moved our classes. So what, it does n't mean they are going to stop,'' said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON>, an Eastside High junior who is an extra in the movie. `` Mostly the only reason you sit in class by now is to go over your review sheets. Books have already been collected.'' Several students and parents have complained that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> crews filming `` Lean on Me'' forced a change in graduation sites, <LOCATION> Passaic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools Superintendent <PERSON> Melindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Persi </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who gained national attention for a get-tough approach to education that includes wielding bullhorns and baseball bats in hallways, could not be reached for comment. Calls left with his secretary Monday were not returned. As the 97-member film crew built sets, sprayed graffiti over lockers and filmed a scene with actor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON>, students hanging out after school said they saw only a positive impact from the movie. Sophomore <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, an extra waiting to be called, said students in the movie have been given plenty of time to do their homework, and tutors are available if needed. She said she hopes to parlay her movie appearance into greater roles in the future. `` I was excited because now there is a chance for us to be noticed,'' she said. Some school officials, however, were worried there are too many distractions at a time of year when important exams are held. `` My concern is just for the kids,'' said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Brightman </PERSON>, a school board member. `` I'd like them to be able to take their exams without a lot of commotion going on.'' <PERSON> Persi </PERSON> sent the <ORGANIZATION> Paterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> a letter asking how the filming of `` Lean on Me'' is affecting the school. In particular, he is asking about newspaper reports that physical education classes have been canceled to let the film crew use the gymnasium; that hallways are being blocked with film equipment; and that regular instruction rooms have been sacrificed for the movie. Producer <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>, who began filming Wednesday, said his crew's presence will have few negative academic effects. `` Sure, it's a little more crowded in the hallways,'' <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> said. `` This is the time of year when everybody starts ` short-timing' anyhow Just come over here and see the exodus at noontime.'' <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> acknowledged causing a change in graduation plans, and attributed it to the artistic preferences of director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Avildsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Avildsen </PERSON> had planned to film the ceremony but because of aesthetic concerns, persuaded the school to move the location to <LOCATION> Baurele </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> from the original and larger site, Hinchcliffe Stadium. Two weeks ago, <PERSON> Avildsen </PERSON> decided not to film the graduation. At that point, another school had reserved the stadium for June 24, forcing Eastside to change its graduation date to June 25.

<HEAD>Complaints Drop, While Airline On-Time Performance Improves</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The number of airline complaints to the government was the lowest in 15 months in May and air carriers also recorded their best on-time performances, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The department said Monday that its consumer affairs office received 36 percent fewer complaints from airline passengers than during the same month in 1987. For the first time since February 1987, the number of complaints dipped below the 2,000 level at 1,820. In April, the latest month for which there was on-time information available, the 14 largest airlines had 82.6 percent of their flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule, compared with 78.8 percent in March, the department said. The April figures were the best since the department began monitoring on-time performance last September and in part reflected good weather during the month, officials said. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> issued a statement saying that the latest on-time and consumer statistics indicate `` that our attempt to instill greater accountability into the -LRB- aviation -RRB- system seems to have made a substantial difference.'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> had the best performance during April with a 90.8 percent on-time arrival rate, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> at 90.3 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> reported a 91.1 percent on-time rate, but that covered only the first eight days of the month before its operations were incorporated into <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> as a result of last year's merger. <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which has been plagued by labor tensions, had the worst on-time arrival rate among the 14 airlines, with 75.5 percent of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> reported a 76.5 percent on-time mark. The airlines also misplaced fewer bags during April with 6.53 baggage complaints for every 1,000 passengers flown, compared with 7.48 reports the previous month and 11.83 reports in January. The April figures for mishandled bags were also the best since the consumer statistics began being compiled last September. The number of passengers bumped from flights because of overbooking also declined. There were 3.71 passenger for every 10,000 boardings involuntarily bumped during April, compared with 5.46 passengers during the first three months of the year, the department said. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, both owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had the highest complaint rate in May with 11.43 complaints for every 100,000 passengers who flew on <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and 10.34 complaints from every 100,000 people on Eastern. While the number of complaints involving <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> was more than any other airline it represented a sharp improvement over a year ago when the department received more than 21 complaints per 100,000 travelers on <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which until recently had consistently been among the airlines with high complaint rates, also showed continued improvement with only 3.22 complaints for every 100,000 passengers flown in May. <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> had the best complaint record with less than 1 complaint for every 100,000 passengers flown. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> had the fewest complaints among the large carriers at 1.32 per 100,000 passengers. The best arrival rate was reported at <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where 90.6 percent of the flights arrived on time during April, followed by 86.7 percent at <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> had the worst arrival record at 68.4 percent. The department tabulates on-time information for the 27 largest airports based on passenger traffic volume. The April on-time statistics are made public at the same time as the May consumer complaint statistics, although the two sets of statistics cover different months.

<HEAD>FDA Approves New Wart Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new treatment is available for the estimated 8 million Americans who suffer each year from genital warts. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday that it has OK'd direct injection of genetically engineered alpha interferon into the warts. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said a study of 192 patients showed they exhibited marked improvement after receiving interferon injections three times a week for up to three weeks. Of the 192, 42 percent experienced complete clearing of all their treated warts, 24 percent had a 75 percent to 99 percent reduction in the size of their treated warts and 18 percent had a 50 percent to 74 percent reduction in the size of their treated warts, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. Previously, the most effective treatments were painful and potentially scarring removal by freezing or burning. Some types of genital warts can be treated with direct application of conventional anti-infective drugs, but this treatment often is not effective. Alpha interferon was first approved in June 1986 as a treatment for hairy cell leukemia _ a rare form of leukemia. Although the presence of genital warts is more distressing than health-threatening, some studies have suggested there could be a relationship in women between the warts and later development of cervical cancer. Adverse reactions experienced during clinical trials were mild flu-like symptoms. The drug is not recommended for use in pregnant women since animal studies have shown the treatment may cause abortions. <ORGANIZATION> Schering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kenilworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, will market the alpha interferon treatment under the Intron-A brand name.

 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sat quietly in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week, waiting for her husband to arrive for a news conference. Since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s wife has rarely attended such events, a reporter called on her to answer a few questions. With a giggle and a grin, the first lady demurred, saying, `` I only rescue people.'' The first lady's response drew a peal of laughter from reporters _ who realized she was referring to a hectic scene several days earlier when she'd reached out to pluck a hapless reporter loose from the over-eager clutches of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. In a number of ways, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> cast her in a defender's role. Although it seemed odd for a woman who rarely goes to church, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used several events during the visit to make subtle points about religious freedom. During a visit to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s Assumption Cathedral _ nowadays a museum _ the first lady questioned her guide and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about its use for religious services and the celebration of the 1,000-year anniversary of the founding of <LOCATION> Christendom </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. She got only curt responses from the Soviet first lady, but Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pursued the topic again several days later. Upon viewing an icon named, `` The Trinity,'' during a tour of the famed Tretyakov Gallery, she told Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> she'd arrived in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Trinity Sunday. Again, little response. At another point, the first lady was told that before she'd come, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had spoken at length about the icons but failed to mention their relgious meaning. `` I do n't know how you can neglect the religious implications,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> insisted. `` I mean, they are there, when you see them.'' The first lady's propaganda points on behalf of religious freedom were accompanied by a few propaganda points on her own behalf, as well. Left smarting after her <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit encounters with the well-spoken and photogenic Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at first appeared intent on showing how to play the polite and well-mannered guest. So, it seemed, a peace pact of the magnitude of the Treaty of <LOCATION> Westphalia </LOCATION> had been reached. The two women held hands, European style, as they toured the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> cathedral on the first day of the visit. And afterwards, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokeswoman <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> relayed quotes from a private afternoon tea in which the two pooh-poohed the `` silly'' idea that there was any rivalry between them. But it did n't last. By Wednesday, when they toured the <ORGANIZATION> Tretyakov </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION>, their equally strong wills collided as they jockeyed for position in front of the cameras. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offered reporters a `` dialogue,'' displaying her opinions of the priceless artwork, going so far as to quote Russian author <PERSON> Feodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dostoevsky </PERSON> on their beauty and how they reflected the Russian soul. This time, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appeared ready for the assertive Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, insisting she be granted equal time. She then made her thanks known to everyone, and chatted a bit with reporters about her experiences. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> backed away, allowing the first lady to have her say. But if body language is a barometer, judge the seating chart that evening _ when the two men sat next to each other in the front row of the Bolshoi's <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> and their ladies sat on the outside _ as far apart from each other as they could be and contrary to normal practice at such events. But at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s departure, there were smiles and waves all around. Perhaps it is the last time the two women will meet and it really is n't necessary that they be friends. Given Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s newfound ability _ as her spokeswoman says _ `` to roll with the punches,'' it's clear Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has discovered she must allow for the moment when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> first lady insists she be allowed her own `` dialogue.'' And through their words and appearances, each first lady has become adept at getting a message across, not only at home, but to their counterpart's homeland as well.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>'s forecast of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> policy is simple: `` Let me predict when the next great debate will occur _ when the next great tragedy occurs in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>.'' The statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> came Monday afternoon as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> again sidestepped the issue of whether to require <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to invoke the War Powers Act and defend his policy under terms of the controversial 1973 law. As Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, said, `` this is not the first time, it's not the second time, it's not even the third time. ... It's the umpteenth time'' the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debated the issue since the May 17, 1987, attack by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on the USS Stark killed 37 sailors. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has been unable to decide the question once and for all because it is divided both on the war powers law and on the separate question of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> policy, senators noted during Monday's debate. The War Powers Act was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over the veto of President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who argued it was an unconstitutional restriction on his power. All succeeding presidents, including <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, have agreed with that point of view. The act requires a report from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> within 48 hours after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are sent into areas of `` imminent hostilities'' and, under some circumstances, requires them to be withdrawn within 60 or 90 days unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> says they can remain. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy involves reflagging 11 Kuwaiti tankers and protecting them with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships in the gulf, scene of fighting in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> is an ally of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Six weeks ago, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mantle of protection was extended to neutral ships that ask for help from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships. Monday's vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was a 54-31 decision to keep a resolution invoking the War Powers act off the top of the chamber's agenda Although Democrats hold a 54-46 advantage in the chamber, the issue cuts across political lines. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, summed up one view of the dilemma On one hand, he said, `` the policy of escorting, of convoying, Kuwaiti ships is not a good one, but that's the policy we're following. On the other, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said, the War Powers Act `` is an unworkable law.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders have introduced a bill to overhaul the act by eliminating the 60-day withdrawal period. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, disagreed that the War Powers law is unwieldy and offered a different reason for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> inaction. `` If we choose to make it work, it'll work, but we do n't have the gumption to make it work,'' he said. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> agreed. `` There seems to be the inability by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to stand up to presidents,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is afraid to take a stand on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy and `` our silence is our complicity. `` If the policy appears to be a success, we can issue statements praising it, but if it appears to be out of hand, we can issue criticisms,'' he explained. The War Powers law was written in response to the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War and reflected a desire by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take back some of the power ceded to the executive branch during <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s longest war. Senators have noted that the Constitution gives <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, not the president, the power to declare war. But the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> conflict was fought without a declaration of war and the modern reality most often features murky <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military deployments such as the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s deployment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for a peacekeeping mission. The latter ended shortly after 241 servicemen were killed by a terrorist truck bomb. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will probably never again declare war,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., referring to that reality The War Powers law and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> policy are also involved in a related federal court fight. Last year, 115 legislators, frustrated at the congressional inability to act, filed suit in federal court seeking an order requiring <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to invoke the law. That challenge was turned down, but the legislators are appealing and say they will pursue their case to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> thinks the law will eventually be struck down by the nation's highest court. `` Once it hits the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, they're going to throw it out like a tub of lard, because it is unconstitutional,'' he said

 Balloonist Per Lindstrand soared more than 10 miles to set an unofficial altitude record, but had to crawl outside his pressurized gondola at 22,000 feet and wield a pocket knife to release stubborn sandbags. Lindstrand on Monday reached 59,700 feet, easily surpassing the 55,137-foot record set in 1980, but fell short of his goal of 60,000 feet in his butane - and solar-powered `` Stratoquest'' hot-air balloon, project coordinator <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said The 12-story-high craft took off into a clear sky, but was hampered by two 200-pound sandbags that failed to release automatically. `` There was no way I could make the altitude record while carrying this sand,'' said the 39-year-old Lindstrand. `` So I had to climb out of the capsule and cut them.'' The first bag was no problem because it was near the hatch, but the second was on the other side of the craft beyond the reach of his oxygen line. `` I had to take a deep breath, run around, cut it off and run back again, all the while clinging on to the outside of the capsule,'' he said. `` That got a bit hairy. `` There were a few white knuckles when I was climbing around there,'' he said. Linstrand figures the sandbag problem cost him about 5,000 feet in potential altitude. `` It was a fairly average day, I think,'' Lindstrand said jokingly. `` We had a particular problem with the sandbags, but nothing my trusty <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> knife could n't handle.'' Last year, Lindstrand and British millionaire <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandson </PERSON> set another record when they became the first ever to cross the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in a hot air balloon. The two hold balloon records for speed, 100 mph; duration, 31 hours and 41 minutes, and distance, 3,075 miles, from that flight.

 Concern over the hazards of chemical pesticides has gone too far, according to members of a farm women's organization meeting in the nation's capital `` We feed our families with the food we grow; we're not going to feed them poison,'' says <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. She is here for the sixth annual <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting of Women Involved in Farm Economics, an organization that brings together farm women from across the country to wrestle with agricultural issues. The group frequently has focused on the intricacies of world markets for farm commodities and federal payment programs. But pressure for congressional action on the pesticide issue prompted an environmental seminar as well this year. Many crops produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and overseas are sprayed with pesticides, some of which the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has linked with cancer and other serious health problems. The two speakers at the farm women's session were representatives of industries that have been major targets of environmental criticism. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Early </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, focused on pesticides, while, <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a legislative analyst with a utility company, discussed the acid rain issue. Early said he doubted that regulatory legislation recently produced by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would be sent to the president's desk this year. He said so many loose ends remain to be tied up in other committees that it will be `` close to impossible to get all these things pulled together.'' `` To do all that before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> goes home and tries to get re-elected _ and they will do that earlier this year _ I just do n't think you can get it all done this year,'' he said His organization is supporting the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s bill but is opposing separate legislation cosponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., and Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn It would impose stringent standards for clean groundwater, which provides the major supply of drinking water for millions of Americans but has in some areas been found to be laced with pesticides. There may be an effort to attach the <PERSON> Leahy-Durenberger </PERSON> plan to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s blueprint for revising the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. After the session, a number of members of the farm women's group agreed to discuss their attitudes toward pesticides at an impromptu roundtable discussion. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, the group's president, recalled how she drove into a farmers market near her home town of <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, not long ago with a truckload of vegetables. Nearby another farmer was parked, advertising that his vegetables were organically grown _ without the use of pesticides. Customers were interested at first, she says. But that changed. `` He had on his truck `` organicially grown'' and as soon as they found the worms on his vegetables, they walked away,'' she recalled. `` They want absolutely perfect products and we have supplied them with them,'' said <PERSON> Naioma </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, a wheat and cattle producer. Environmentalists, she said, `` are not looking at the total, full picture'' and often have `` a biased and slanted view.'' The notion that farmers are poisoning the land with toxic chemicals is absurd, she said. `` Our families depend on it. Our futures and our childrens' futures depend on it. `` My husband really respects the chemicals and is very careful how he uses them,'' said <PERSON> Merlina </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Almira </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. She also recalled a trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last year to inspect irrigation systems used in that country She saw `` beautiful vegetables'' grown there without benefit of pesticides. `` But those same vegetables would not be bought in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> store,'' she said. The reason? Too many flaws caused by pests. The women condemned the notion that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law should attempt to eliminate all risk from the use of pesticides. Instead, they said, pesticide use should be likened to the use of certain drugs that are beneficial in treating illnesses but sometimes have side effects, or to automobiles, which are certain to mean highway fatalities but provide vital transportation. They also pointed the finger at pesticides banned here that are being used overseas on crops that are then brought into this country. `` They're being used in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and hauled across the border,'' said <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, cotton and peanut grower.

 A Farm Belt senator clashed with administration officials after they rejected both his bill to increase the nation's commitment to agricultural research and similar recommendations from an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> task force `` You're rejecting the recommendations of your own task force,'' Sen. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, said Monday after <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> voiced opposition to the proposals. The bill would set up an independent corporation to make research grants and provide federal funding for it. The price tag envisioned by <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> would be $ 100 million. The task force recommended $ 1 billion. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> deputy assistant secretary for science and education, made clear that the department was opposed. `` We do disagree with the amount that was involved and we do disagree with the mechanisms that were involved, and that's our privilege as it was their privilege to make those recommendations,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> already supports a sizeable, government-operated agricultural research program, and <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>'s legislation would add a new layer of bureaucracy. He also said the administration would not back research grants that could not be reviewed by the secretary of agriculture.

<HEAD>Delegates Flock To Dukakis As He Heads Over The Top</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> closed to within 200 delegates of locking up the Democratic presidential nomination even before the first votes were counted in today's season-ending primaries, boosted by a surge of about 180 in the last week. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up 75 of those new delegates on Monday alone, some prodded into declaring their support by his campaign staff and others attracted by the near-gravitational force that surrounds a winner. `` He's been on a roll,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON>, deputy director of delegate selection for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. `` He's shown election success week after week after week,'' she said. `` It casts a very favorable light on <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' Much of the surge came courtesy of `` super delegates,'' the party leaders and elected officials who have heavily favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, to the chagrin of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also has been converting delegates who had been pledged to the suspended candidacies of Sens. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. On Monday, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, a staunch supporter of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, switched to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and brought the bulk of his state's 65-member delegation with him This came two days after <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said he would continue to support <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. And in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> on Monday, Gov. Rose Mofford and four other `` super delegates'' moved to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from the uncommitted ranks, where they had been since former Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> dropped out of the presidential race. By its own estimates, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has moved within striking distance of the 2,081 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. With fewer than 200 delegates to go, the campaign expects to take at least 280 of the 466 delegates at stake in today's primaries in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The intensity of the operation to contact and win delegates has picked up as the primary season draws to a close. Delegates are told that `` the governor would appreciate it very much if they would get into the count earlier rather than later,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON> said. `` The goal of all of this is to take the pressure off <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> after June 7 so he can go about the process of building a coalition for the general election,'' she said. Another incentive is the memory of 1984, when <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> finished the final round of primaries without enough delegates to lock up the nomination and spent an extra day pleading with a handful of delegates to put him over the top. Some members of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' staff, including delegate chief <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, worked for <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> four years ago. Of the 178 delegates moved into the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> column in the last week, roughly half were super delegates, the party leaders and politicians who automatically hold seats at the convention, and the rest were delegates picked through the primaries and caucuses who had been uncommitted or pledged to other candidates. `` I think that the advantage that we have is that we have been on the phones with these people so long and there is a real strong bond between some of these people and the campaign,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON> said. By Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held support from more than 321 of the 643 super delegates, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was backed by just 54, of whom 42 are black, according to The Associated Press delegate count. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has complained that the super delegates have disproportionately favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and hinted he may challenge the rules that created them. He also has indicated he may launch a convention challenge against the rules that allow some states to pick other delegates in a manner that does not reflect the results of the states' primaries.

 In the dusk of a spring evening, with his family gathered before the simple cross that marks his grave, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was remembered as a father who guided his children with love and understanding and as a public figure who was `` always ready to stop and reach out to others.'' Tourists mingled with friends and aides of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> senator Monday evening at a Mass of remembrance for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who was shot by an assassin 20 years ago as he left a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> celebration of his victory in the 1968 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> presidential primary. `` I invite you to join us in renewing the commitment that was his life, his spirit and his hope,'' said <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who was not yet 3 -LCB- years old when his father died. It was the first time the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family had invited outsiders to take part in a memorial service. All 10 surviving children had a brief part in the service. The 11th child, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, was found dead of a drug overdose in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in April 1984. His widow, <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, arrived on the arms of her brother-in-law, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. She did not speak at the service, but she told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in a taped interview that her husband `` brought us all along with his enthusiasm ... his love of life ... his curiosity.'' `` He made everybody feel a part of this battle, that we're going to do better, that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can stand for something,'' she said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s grave _ only a few steps from the more ornate site where his brother, President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, is buried _ was unadorned for the service but an altar was set up nearby for the Mass. In front was a box with 400-500 pink Eveline roses ordered by <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Six choirs sang and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> band played. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> sang `` Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory,'' as he did on the night <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was buried. The sun was setting over the cemetery as the service began and as it ended, the crowd lighted candles that had been handed to them as they entered. The flickering lights cast a soft glow as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> read a Shakespearean quotation his uncle often recited: `` When he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine _ that all the world will be in love with night, and pay no worship to the garish sun.'' The youngest <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> child, daughter <PERSON> Rory </PERSON>, had not yet been born at the time of her father's death. Now 19 and a freshman at <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, she quoted from a speech her father delivered in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> in 1968: `` Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago, to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of the world.'' `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was always ready to stop and reach out to others,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the oldest son, who is a congressman from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. He recalled how his father, tired after a week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, would return to their seaside home in <LOCATION> Hyannisport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and make it a point to speak with each of the children about their week. `` He was deeply responsive to others, especially those who were needy and vulnerable,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, a 34-year-old son who bears his father's name, asked the crowd for a moment's prayer for a policeman who was struck and critically injured by a motorist as the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> motorcade was making its way to the service. <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhe </PERSON>, 31, a fund-raiser for the <ORGANIZATION> RFK </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, quoted from a speech that the former senator gave during the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> primary campaign in 1968 a week before he was assassinated. `` Perhaps this world will always be a world in which children suffer,'' she recited. `` But we can reduce the number of suffering children and if you do n't help us, who will?'' The other <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> children who took part in the mass were <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, 36, who heads a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> youth corps program and was an unsuccessful candidate for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, 35; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 34, who teaches environmental law at <ORGANIZATION> Pace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, 30, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, 28, who runs <ORGANIZATION> RFK </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, 24, who works for the family-owned Merchandise mart in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, 23, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, 21, a sophomore at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Rory </PERSON>, 19, a freshman at <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. The gathering included some important names from the <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> era, such as <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>, a top aide and biographer to both <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> brothers; <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice appointed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and former Olympic decathlon champion <PERSON> Rafer </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> who was with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> when he was shot. Neither <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> nor her daughter, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlossberg </PERSON>, attended the service. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was shot by <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> and mortally wounded shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, after he had addressed a crowd of supporters gathered in the Ambassador Hotel to celebrate his election victory of the day before. The senator, then 42, died the next day. The Jordanian-born assassin, who said he did not know what drove him to the deed, still is in prison.

 Two dozen contestants tried their charms on <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, but a 4-year-old boy was the only one able to spark the interest of the 5-foot-long boa constrictor. `` I can make a sound like a snake,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Anglin </PERSON> said as he looked into the serpent's eyes. `` I can. Listen. Ssssssssssssss.'' <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> slithered with interest. Cole backed away. The boy was declared the winner of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Zoo's snake-charming contest because he was the only one able to coax <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> into moving He won a certificate worth $ 40 at a restaurant. Others tried to tempt the snake from her wooden perch Sunday, but <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> turned them down cold. <PERSON> Gordhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Patel </PERSON>, a 51-year-old hospital worker who successfully sweet-talked <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> last year, was n't able to repeat the feat. Perhaps it was because <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> used the same line: `` You like pizza? Spaghetti?

When that did n't work, he tried, `` How about a fat, juicy rat?'' Each competitor was allowed one minute to stand before <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, and try to coax it into motion. Three judges gauged audience and serpent reaction. The contest was part of the zoo's `` Snakes of the Metroplex'' weekend, an exhibit of snakes indigenous to the region. Boa constrictors like <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, however, in the wild live in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> converted dozens of delegates to his cause on Monday and said he was looking forward to clinching the Democratic presidential nomination in Tuesday's final round of primaries. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> bought half an hour of television time to make a live primary-eve appeal for votes in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but got caught in traffic and missed half of the show. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who wrapped up the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination weeks ago, said in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that he expects to find himself differing increasingly with administration policy as the campaign goes on. `` We'll probably be dragged into more and more of these things rather than less,'' he said at a news conference where he was asked about one such difference, his advocacy of a delay in an offshore oil lease. The oil-lease issue became moot Monday night, however, when <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> abruptly suspended plans to proceed with a controversial drilling project off <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s primary-eve move followed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for a delay in the project. Both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> oppose the offshore drilling, and the issue has been an important one in environmentally sensitive <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, meanwhile, spent a busy last day of campaigning before the election _ so busy that he got tied up in traffic and arrived 16 minutes late for a half-hour live broadcast that was supposed to be a dramatic final appeal for votes. The television time for the show, broadcast throughout the state, cost $ 150,000. Rock disc jockey <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasem </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter, filled the time while waiting for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with an interview with a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign official and video montages. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said after the show he planned a meeting with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> late Monday night at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s hotel. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides have confidently predicted for weeks their man would amass the 2,081 delegates needed for the nomination by the time the primaries ended. And with one day remaining until then, they were leaving nothing to chance. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor picked up more than 70 delegates during the day, increasing his total to 1,874. That left less than 200 short of the total needed, and aides said he would pick up that many and more from the 466 at stake in primaries in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was also preparing to pick up endorsements on Wednesday from former rivals Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, campaign sources said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was to stop off in <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> to formally receive the congressman's backing. And <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was to make an endorsement statement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, without <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> present, the sources said. `` This has been a great 15 months. I'm excited about what happened and I'm looking forward, if all goes well, to a decisive victory ... so we can lock up the nomination,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said as he campaigned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. An ABC News tracking poll released Monday night suggested <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a 2-1 lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The survey indicated he had the of 61 percent of those surveyed, to 30 percent for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The figures, from sampling of 415 voters done over the weekend, represented a slight gain for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The poll's margin of error was 6 percentage points. More than 40 of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' fresh delegates came from <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, where Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> led the way. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> and many other delegates there had been supporting drop-out candidate <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr.. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> still spoke of chances for a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> upset as he made the final rounds of his campaign and arranged a 30-minute paid televised appeal in several of the state's large cities But his talked turned increasingly to the pre-convention bargaining that lies ahead. He said he would push <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to stop moving `` cautiously and conservatively'' and to use the party platoform to take a stronger stand against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` If he will not bend on that matter, we'll simply meet each other on the floor'' at the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who finished first or second in dozens of primaries and caucuses, said he wanted changes in party rules, as well, particularly those dealing with selection of delegates in future campaigns. In all he said, however, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also was careful to add, `` We can resolve our differences within the contest of our party and not in the streets, and that's growth.'' He said, `` I intend to keep building our party, keep expanding participation, keep registering voters, keep encouraging people to be involved.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sounded anything but upset at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s talk. `` I know how strongly he feels about the importance of a Democrat in the White House next January,'' he said. Of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s position on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the governor said: `` I do n't think it's going to be a problem ... I'm for tougher sanctions. I hope it's going to be in our platform, and I do n't see where this is going to be a division in our party or our country.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner also jabbed at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the subject of off-shore oil drilling. The vice president, staking out a difference with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy, said on Sunday he favors a delay in a controversal drilling project off the coast of northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: `` I'm pleased he's coming around, but it's kind of late. I'm not for delaying that sale. I'm for canceling it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a Republican audience in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Monday night that he has major differences with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on a range of issues. He criticized the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor for failing to support the death penalty for big-time drug traffickers, over a prisoner-furlough program in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and on arms control matters. Pointing to the recent U.S.-Soviet INF treaty, the vice president said: `` If we'd listened to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, we would n't have made any progress at all.''

<TEXT>
 One hundred years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> took $ 770 in donations and built a wood and stone cabin just above the timberline in the shadow of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Madison Spring Hut, an oasis for hikers 4,800 feet above sea level between <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, was the first of a series of rustic cabins that have been a model for wilderness shelters as far away as <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Over the weekend, former workers and patrons held a reunion at that hut. <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> started out providing solid meals, a bed and wool blanket and first aid to hikers in the Presidential Range, which includes <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and is known for some of the harshest weather in the world. As Madison enters its 100th season, the mission and the weather have n't changed _ Monday's forecast called for possible snow flurries and wind up to 90 mph. But now there are eight huts throughout the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> accommodating the thousands of hikers who flood in from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and other nearby urban areas. <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>'s four-story bunk beds, which fill two small wood-paneled bedrooms, are booked months in advance by backpackers. The central dining room, with a picture window facing <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION>, seats 60. For the weekend gathering, opening the hut's centennial season of providing `` hospitality in high places,'' the <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> invited hut caretakers from as far back as the early 1920s to a nostalgic party at the base of the mountains and a hike back to <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>. For some, it was a pilgrimage. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Deans </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> executive director, wistfully recalled `` the wind in my face, the aches in the shoulder when you take off a pack _ a good ache _ the smell of oil and of boot grease.'' Such sentiments were shared by most for whom the opportunity to work in the wilderness more than compensated for low salaries and long hours. `` Back then, we made $ 4 a week,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON>, 80, who worked at <ORGANIZATION> Pinkham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notch </ORGANIZATION> camp at the base of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1924. The next summer, <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON> moved to another hut where his duties included carrying 100-pound packs of food and supplies four miles from a base camp several times a week. Today, though helicopters drop tons of supplies into huts twice each season, packing still is the main source of fresh food. Pack weights and sizes are the stuff of <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> hut legends, and they seemed to grow as the weekend went on. `` I carried 165 pounds,'' said <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a 1983 Madison hutman. `` There was a party and we needed a couple roasts and a watermelon.'' On Sunday morning, former hutmen and hutwomen converged on the 3.7-mile <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION> trail which leads straight up to <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>. `` I think it's been lengthened,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohler </PERSON>, 72, of the steep hike, which he knew well from working at Madison in the summers from 1936 to 1939. <PERSON> Ohler </PERSON> recalled stealing chairs from other huts, cleaning mouse droppings from between the plates, heating the hut with bacon grease and eating porcupine livers. `` The nose of a porcupine got 20 cents from the town clerk. That's where we got our beer money,'' he said. <PERSON> Ohler </PERSON> also remembered the death of a teen-ager from hypothermia during an August storm in which temperatures hit the low 30s. <PERSON> Ohler </PERSON> had the job of tying the boy to a pack-board and carrying him down the mountain on his back. More than 100 people have died in the mountains. Search and rescue missions occupied 1,800 <ORGANIZATION> AMC </ORGANIZATION> work-hours last year, even though search communications have improved because of radios, huts manager <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrey </PERSON> said. `` Things have changed, including our bodies. That's what I noticed creaking up the <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>'s 1979 hut master. `` But the most important things are the same. The hut experience really was the best experience of my life.''

<HEAD>Senate Passes Budget $1.1 Trillion Budget For 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was fulfilling a deficit reduction agreement with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> when it passed a $ 1.1 trillion federal budget for fiscal 1989, but a hefty deficit remains and spending priorities have already shifted. The budget, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last month and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday by 58-29, shows a deficit of nearly $ 142 billion when not counting sales of government assets, which are n't counted under the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law. The president's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> says higher interest rates combined with government bail-outs of banks could drive the deficit higher. If it gets past $ 146 billion, <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> is required to order automatic, across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law. And the spending plan does n't come close to meeting Gramm-Rudman's goals for the years after fiscal 1989, which are designed to force a balanced budget by fiscal 1993. `` This is a paltry, pathetic and completely meaningless reduction -LRB- of the deficit -RRB- during times of economic prosperity,'' complained Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo. `` We're just putting the whole problem off until after the election. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., conceded: `` We've taken some steps in the right direction, but I'm afraid there's miles to go before we sleep. The spending plan also was nearly two months after the April 15 deadline, creating confusion over the details of next year's federal spending policy. Within total spending levels for military, foreign aid and domestic programs that were set by last fall's agreement with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the budget envisions increased federal spending on the space program, education, AIDS research, fighting drugs, and other election-year priorities. But the resolution itself is non-binding, acting only as a guide for production of the annual spending legislation for running the government. And because of the delays, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have been moving ahead with the regular spending bills that stray from the budget's priorities. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted to include less money for education and space programs, shifting those funds to energy and interior agencies. `` We urge the appropriations committee to follow our lead and support the nation's future through increased funding for science and space programs,'' said <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, who had pushed hard for that new spending. Those and other details of next year's federal spending will be settled in the next few months before the start of fiscal 1989. Some of the policies envisioned in the budget: _ No new taxes for the next year beyond the $ 14 billion enacted last December under the agreement with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ Overall budget increases of about half the inflation rate, including $ 294 billion for the military, $ 16.1 billion for foreign aid and $ 169.2 billion for domestic agencies _ Rejection of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s call to cancel several domestic programs, such as development grants to state and local governments _ Full inflation increases for entitlement benefits, including Social Security, estimated at 4.2 percent _ A 21 percent increase over current levels for science, space and technology programs, including the space shuttle program and the superconducting super collider _ About $ 4 billion for anti-drug programs, plus a provision allowing more to be spent if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president agree on a way to pay for it _ A 4 percent pay raise for the military and civilian federal workers _ Money for hiring 900 additional air traffic controllers and for modernizing the air traffic control system Overall spending would be about $ 5 billion above <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request and $ 44 billion above this year's level. Total revenues would be about $ 964 billion. The deficit in fiscal 1987 was $ 150.2 billion. The administration estimates it will drop slightly, to $ 146 billion, in fiscal 1988, which ends Sept. 30.

 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaumberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Quade </PERSON>, who helped develop the methodical problem-solving method known as systems analysis, died after suffering a stroke, the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said. He was 79. <PERSON> Quade </PERSON>, who had cancer of the spine, died Saturday at <LOCATION> Saddleback </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after suffering the stroke a week earlier, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica-based </LOCATION> think tank, said Monday. The <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, native, a consultant to Rand at the time of his death, joined the research group when it was founded in 1948 and retired in 1973. He and some colleagues devised and developed systems analysis as a recognized scientific discipline, Weeks said. <PERSON> Quade </PERSON>'s 1968 book, `` Systems Analysis and Policy Planning: Applications in Defense,'' defined systems analysis as `` a systematic approach to helping a decision-maker choose a course of action by investigating his full problem, searching out objectives and alternatives, and comparing them in the light of their consequences.'' <PERSON> Quade </PERSON> studied physics and mathematics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, and earned his doctorate at <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday he expects to find himself differing increasingly with administration policy as the presidential campaign progresses. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would try to keep the situation to `` where I do n't go out and do something to tear down or be negative about this president It may not always be that easy.'' `` We'll probably be dragged into more and more of these things rather than less,'' he said at a news conference at which he was questioned about his most recent departure from administration policy, his advocacy of a delay in an offshore drilling lease off the northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. `` As I become the standard bearer of this party, I'm going to be saying, without regard to current administration position, here's what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> feels, here's what I feel, here's what my aspirations for the country are,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said He said he understood that `` somebody is going to be raising the question, are you breaking with the president.'' On the matter of the northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> offshore drilling, however, the administration came around to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s point of view. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> on Monday night suspended plans for the controversial project. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s primary-eve action came after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran into criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over the oil-lease question. Asked about that criticism, the vice president said, `` I have a good deal more information than Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. I made my living at it.'' He said, `` I do not favor shutting down all off-shore drilling in this country.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, also campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for delay on the project off northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, `` I'm pleased he's coming around, but it's kind of late I'm not for delaying that sale _ I'm for canceling it. `` It's easy to say, ` We'll delay it until after the election.' What does that mean?'' The proposed lease sale of the northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> tracts had been tentatively scheduled for February 1989, pending a decision by the next administration. But <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s action, announced in a statement issued Monday night in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, puts the project on hold indefinitely. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, brushed aside polls that show him trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as well as nationwide. `` I like this concept of being behind in the polls,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that in one survey `` two-thirds of the respondents say that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is more conservative than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' He said, `` There's something weird about that. He opened the news conference by reading a statement in which he endorsed legislation that would pay reparations to Japanese-Americans interned during World War II. The administration has not taken a position on the bill. `` It is only fair that our country provide apologies and reparations to those innocent Japanese-Americans who suffered as a result of their internment,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke to reporters at <ORGANIZATION> Chaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> where he met with students and faculty to talk about drug and alcohol abuse programs. He told the students he favored jail sentences for people convicted of second offenses of drug use. `` Drug possession should lead to arrest and a sentence,'' he said. `` The sentence does n't have to be jail time, automatically. There are other alternatives _ a hefty fine, suspending a license, putting a picture in the paper. ... But failing to stay drug-free after arrest should mean time in jail. The message should be unambiguous: If you wo n't stop, then we'll stop you.''

 One of the two winners who split a record $ 51.4 million lottery jackpot says he was relieved he has to share the windfall so he does n't have to face `` all this by myself.'' `` Honest to God, I was hoping that somebody else hit it, too,'' said <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> supermarket clerk <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON>, 26, who will divide <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest lottery jackpot with aircraft mechanic <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, a mechanic at <ORGANIZATION> Travis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, said he purchased $ 100 worth of tickets himself because he could n't find someone to share his bet. The winners, who found themselves instant celebrities Monday, each will receive $ 25.7 million annuities that pay $ 1,028,000 annually, after taxes, for 20 years, lottery officials said. At a news conference attended by 100 people, including cheering lottery agency workers, the Lotto 6-49 winners said they both used a feature of the lottery ticket terminals that randomly selects numbers for the player and that they were regular lotto players. The winners in Saturday's drawing said they plan to quit their jobs and have few immediate plans for the money except to help relatives in various ways. Both also said they would be ready for an onslaught of strangers interested in their bonanza, but declined to discuss details of their plans. <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON> said that after buying his tickets, `` I found a heads-up penny.'' `` Every time I've ever found a heads-up penny, something's always happened good to me. I'm superstitious, I guess,'' he said. <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON> said he has been buying $ 5 to $ 10 in lottery tickets a week. <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON> was uncertain what he'll use the money for, beyond helping his family, but said he would have more time to indulge his hobby of collecting antique toys. He added that he has never won anything before. Being single, he was asked if he had any trouble getting dates. Replied <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON>, `` No. But who wants dates now. I do n't.'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said he could n't find someone to match $ 50 with his $ 50 to split the bet so he purchased $ 100 worth of tickets. `` I asked my boss ... if he would like to share with me. I said, ` Give me $ 50 and we'll split the winnings.' At the time, it -LRB- the jackpot -RRB- was around $ 40 million. I said, ` Really, no one needs more than $ 40 million.'

Her husband summed up the feelings both winners expressed about their good fortune: `` It's all happened so fast.'' The jackpot eclipsed a $ 46 million prize last October in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The biggest previous <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> jackpot that anybody won, $ 25.4 million, was split by two players in October. The odds of picking all six numbers out of 49 were about one in 14 million. The winning numbers were 48, 42, 9, 14, 19, 31. The tickets cost $ 1.

 Opposition Laborites feuded after party leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> said the country's nuclear weapons should be used as bargaining chips in arms talks _ not just unilaterally scrapped. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>'s comments were taken as a strong indication he would discard the party's commitment to elimination of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s nuclear weapons. Party leftists have long been suspicious that <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> intended to ditch the anti-nuclear policy before his next election battle against <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. After he made his remarks Sunday in a television interview, party leftists on Monday charged him with ignoring the socialist movement's official policy. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> said Sunday that in the wake of the superpower treaty to eliminate those nations' intermediate-range nuclear missiles, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> government would be wise to use the British arsenal as a bargaining chip instead of simply scrapping the weapons and shutting down <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear bases. `` We would be complete fools, whatever our politics, to ignore the scope and scale of the change and the opportunities and responsibilities that go with trying to be part of that change,'' said <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>. `` There is no need now for a something-for-nothing unilateralism.'' Polaris missiles now based in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are due to be replaced in the early 1990s by the new and far more potent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trident missile system, capable of hitting most Soviet cities. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, 46, who has been a lifetime anti-nuclear campaigner, refused left-wing demands to reaffirm the unilateral disarmament pledge, saying, `` No, I am not going to issue incantations.'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Benn </PERSON>, a veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> left, complained that <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> was following previous Labor prime ministers _ including <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaghan </PERSON> _ who that ensured <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> remained a nuclear power. `` The real problem for the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is not that we have never persuaded the electorate to support our policies, but that we have never persuaded our leaders,'' said <PERSON> Benn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Benn </PERSON> is to run against <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> for the leadership of the party at the annual conference in the fall but is given little chance of winning. In 1982, three years after losing power to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making annual conference voted for unilateral nuclear disarmament by a two-thirds majority _ meaning it must be part of the election platform The pledge was widely seen as being one reason for Labor's two subsequent defeats by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in 1983 and 1987. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>'s new position is viewed as a shift to the right in an attempt to regain power. The next election is to be held before 1992. For the left-wingers in his party, the <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> switch evokes both anger and a sense of betrayal toward a politician who was once a left-winger himself and had been an active member of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s anti-nuclear campaign since he was a student

 Rock' n' roll star <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> is being sought by police after failing to surrender for booking on a 6-month-old misdemeanor assault charge alleging that he slapped a woman. Police Officer <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Polster </PERSON> said he believes <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, 62, failed to show as expected Sunday because of a misunderstanding between prosecutors and <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s lawyer. A warrant had already been issued for <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s arrest in January after he failed to appear in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Criminal Court to answer the assault charge. If convicted, he could face up to a year in jail.

 A joint national proposal by the governors of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to reduce acid rain shows <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> `` is finally reading the writing on the wall'' and seeking help to curb pollution from its coal-fired power plants, a congressman says. On Monday, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> made public their proposal to reduce polluting sulfur dioxide emissions from utility sources by 10 million tons by the year 2003. The plan calls for authorizing $ 900 million a year from the federal government to finance up to 50 percent of the capital costs. Most of that money would come from having the oil industry take over the cost of filling the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The polluters themselves would have to raise about $ 900 million a year under the deal. Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, D-Minn., said it represents `` significant progress'' anytime <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> can agree on acid rain Sulfur dioxide emissions from the burning of coal have been blamed as a major cause of acid rain, which environmentalists say is destroying waters and woodlands in the Northeast. Much of the sulfur dioxide comes from coal-burning power plants along the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is the main sponsor of an acid rain control bill pending in committee. His bill would mandate a 10-million-ton reduction in emissions by 1998. `` This agreement shows that there is renewed seriousness about dealing with the issue,'' <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON> said. `` It indicates that <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> is finally reading the writing on the wall. This could be their last good chance at legislation that assists them with their cleanup costs.'' But the proposal drew fire from other lawmakers. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said that while he is encouraged by the dialogue between <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on acid rain, he sees nothing new in the `` The key element of any effort to deal with acid rain has to be time,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. `` And this proposal does not allow enough time for the development of clean-coal technologies. Coal is essential to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s national security, and we can not afford to adopt an acid rain policy that would devastate the coal industry.'' Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the proposal would hurt <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and accused <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> of not speaking for Ohioans on the issue. Regardless of the financing `` gimmicks,'' said <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> consumers `` will pay millions of dollars and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> will lose thousands of jobs for no known benefit.'' <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, next to coal-rich <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, has a significant coal-mining industry. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt., said he believes the proposal represents a breakthrough because it is the first time a major emitter of sulfur dioxide, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, has attempted to come to grips with the acid rain problem <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, who is ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has been a major proponent of acid rain control and is a co-sponsor of legislation authored by Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, that would reduce emissions by 12 million tons. `` I think it's a very encouraging development,'' said <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, adding that he expects that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee will want to review the <LOCATION> Ohio-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> proposal and possibly amend the pending legislation to take advantage of the initiative. The proposal, an amendment to the Clean Air Act, calls for reductions in sulfur dioxide emmissions in three phases: 3.5 million tons by 1993, another 4.5 million tons by 1998 and another 2 million tons by 2003. The agreement would also establish a 10-year, $ 2.5 billion expanded clean coal technology program to achieve reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, called the new proposal encouraging because it comes in part from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the largest single emitter of sulfur dioxide in the nation. `` This is a statesmanlike proposal, but it does n't include enough reductions soon enough to adequately protect public health or the environment,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. However, he said the environmental group believes that the proposal will help move acid rain control legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the deadlines in the <LOCATION> Celeste-Cuomo </LOCATION> proposal are not flexible enough to allow for the use of new clean-coal technologies. And she said the additional costs to the oil industry would be passed along to consumers. `` We do n't see that this is going to give us any better long-term reductions than the program that is already in place,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying he `` ca n't wait for this primary season to end,'' is going on the offensive in an effort to portray Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> liberal in the stripe of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>.'' The primary season ends today with voting in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. At a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> function in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> applied the `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> liberal'' label to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. And at a news conference earlier in the day, he said, `` I do n't sense a swing to the left in this country to this <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, liberalism.'' <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> grew up and lives today. In his remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> audience, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ticked off a number of issues on which he said he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> differ. `` I favor the death penalty for drug kingpins and he opposes it,'' said the vice president. `` I'll never understand,'' he went on `` why <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vetoed a bill providing for the Pledge of Allegiance to be said in the schools of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. I favor the Pledge of Allegiance being said anywhere and everywhere.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he vetoed the legislation after being advised by the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION> that it was unconstitutional. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s free-wheeling attack on the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the sort of offensive many Republicans have been advising as a way to overcome the advantage <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> currently holds in opinion polls of voters. At his news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed surveys suggesting he trails <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and nationwide. He said that in one survey two-thirds of the respondents said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was more conservative than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` There's something weird about that,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was certain to sweep the 175 delegates at stake in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s winner-take-all Republican primary. All of his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponents have dropped out of the race and endorsed him for the party's nomination to succeed <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was expected to pick up enough delegates in the day's four primaries to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters contend that the public has a distorted image of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor because he has been involved in a race against <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a contest in which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came across as a moderate. A major goal for the Republicans is to portray <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal who would return the country to big spending domestic programs. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor twitted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over the vice president's decision to call Sunday for a delay in offshore oil drilling off the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called the decision an effort to curry favor among <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters who tend to feel strongly about environmental issues. The issue subsided when <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> suspended plans to lease 1.1 million acres off the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast for oil drilling. `` He can make a political challenge,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' criticism, `` and I will be challenging him as to what he thinks is a great energy program for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I have a good deal more information than Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. I made my living at it -LRB- oil drilling -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, drawing a contrast between his position and that of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said, `` I do not favor shutting down all offshore drilling in this country.'' He said their differences would be aired and `` I am, I think, on the right side.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who speaks fluent <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> has shown strength in some surveys among <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s large Hispanic population, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was confident of doing well among the same voters. `` On the Hispanics, I have some understanding there,'' he said `` because three of my grandchildren are half Mexican.'' His son <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON>'s wife is Mexican. `` I think I understand the heartbeat of the Hispanic community,'' he went on. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position on the offshore drilling was another step away from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy which favors more drilling, and the vice president said more such differences would emerge. `` As I become the standard-bearer of this party, I'm going to be saying, without regard to current administration position, here's what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> feels,'' he said `` We'll probably be dragged into more of these things rather than less, but I will try to keep it that I do n't go out and do something to tear down or be negative about this president. It may not always be that easy.''

<TEXT>
 A new tabloid aimed at encouraging Hoosiers to spend a night at the opera instead of a night at the basketball game features screaming headlines and bizarre tales _ of <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. According to the debut edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>, an avid opera fan supposedly gave birth to a boy during the last act of a performance of `` Tales of <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>.'' Three ushers and a cast member received a standing ovation for helping with the delivery. Another story tells the tongue-in-cheek tale of a teen-ager who took off his personal stereo for the first time in three years to hear the opera `` Carmen.'' `` He washed the green and pink dye out of his hair, put on clean clothes and helped me set the table,'' his thrilled mother was quoted as saying. The Inquirer will be mailed to subscribers and about 20,000 non-subscribers. A ticket order form is included. `` I love it because you're definitely going to read it and it has the confidence to have humor. It says that opera is for everyone,'' <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> Opera Artistic Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Driver </PERSON> said. `` Opera has always been viewed as the fat lady with the big voice, as stodgy and only for the elite. But that's not at all true,'' said <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Hickman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> advertising agency and the brains behind the Inquirer campaign. Two years ago, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> had 900 subscribers. Last year, after another <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON> promotion, there were 1,300. <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON> and opera officials said the numbers indicate how difficult it is to sell opera in sports-loving <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. They believe the tabloid will help change attitudes. `` Just like sports, opera is recreation, enjoyment and fun,'' said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Noblitt </PERSON>, marketing and public relations director of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>. `` The unknown is always a little scary, but we want to excite people and get them to try it.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> has taken a turn for the worse and is suffering pneumonia and an attempt by his body to reject the lungs he received in a May 7 transplant, doctors say. `` It's a definite setback. No question about it. His condition is pretty serious,'' Dr. <PERSON> Seshadri </PERSON> <PERSON> Raju </PERSON>, who led the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> transplant team, said Monday. The 60-year-old <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, who suffered from emphysema, overcame earlier episodes of infection and rejection and had been doing well enough in a private room to walk with assistance and ride a stationary cycle. He was moved out of his private room and into coronary care Sunday night because he was having difficulty breathing, perhaps because of the pneumonia, <PERSON> Raju </PERSON> said. `` It will take 24 to 36 hours to sort things out. We think he may be having a rejection on top of an infection,'' he added, saying he suspects a rejection episode because of the deterioration in <LOCATION> Spence </LOCATION>'s condition. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> is being treated with Gentamicin and Vancomycin, two of the most powerful antibiotics available, and is being fed intravenously while receiving supplemental oxygen, <PERSON> Raju </PERSON> said. His blood pressure, heart and kidneys continue to be normal, <PERSON> Raju </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, whose condition has been downgraded from stable to serious, was alert and talking until he was heavily sedated, <PERSON> Raju </PERSON> added.

 Prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fell slightly at the end of trading Tuesday after a record high closing the previous day, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar weakened against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues declined by a light 28.92 points, or 0.1 percent, to finish the day's trading at 27,967.32.

<HEAD>Japan Says It Is Trimming Trade Surplus, Urges U.S. To Do Its Share</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRENE M. KUNII</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is trimming its huge trade surplus by expanding imports and stepping up overseas investment, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said today. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must do its part for the world economy by easing its budget and trade deficits, the ministry said in a report summing up <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s foreign trade in 1987. It also said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should play a bigger role in Asian development through direct investment and importing more of the region's manufactured goods The report, issued annually since 1949, praises ongoing structural changes that have improved access to the Japanese market for foreign exporters of manufactured goods. `` Manufactured imports are increasing rapidly and the distribution system in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is undergoing a change,'' said <PERSON> Atsushi </PERSON> <PERSON> Oi </PERSON>, head of the ministry's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus fell in fiscal 1987 for the first time in six years, from $ 101.65 billion in 1986 to $ 94.28 billion, according to Japanese figures. Still, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continued to climb, hitting $ 4.9 billion in December 1987 from $ 4.7 billion a year earlier, the latest government figures show. <PERSON> Oi </PERSON> said increased exports of capital goods to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contributed to the increase. Capital goods exports are rising as Japanese firms send equipment to set up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production facilities. `` Secondly, and this has a bigger share, is that American companies look to excellent capital goods exports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and install these in their plants,'' <PERSON> Oi </PERSON> said. Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> said exports bound for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will fall from the present 40 percent share of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s total to 25-30 percent as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> restructures its export-driven economy toward domestic demand He did not give a time frame. The trade ministry report says Japanese imports grew by 9.3 percent in 1987 over the previous year, while export volume rose only 0.3 percent. <PERSON> Oi </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can lessen its trade deficit by cutting down on excessive consumer demand, expanding production facilities and revamping its export policy. The report says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit hit $ 171.2 billion in 1987, up $ 15 billion over 1986. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> rose by a meager 8.4 percent in 1987, but those from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s newly industrialized countries of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> soared by 50.3 percent, the report says. The white paper is cautious about the future of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s restructuring It says that while imports are growing along with domestic demand, nations awash in surplus funds like <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` must expand imports and provide a stable supply of capital to debtor nations.'' `` The role of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from now on is to help <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries create ... a region of development that is open to the rest of the world,'' <PERSON> Oi </PERSON> said.

 Right-wing groups today protested the arrival of two Soviet fishing vessels by blasting anti-Soviet slogans at them from 110 cars and trucks rigged with loudspeakers. More than 1,700 police officers were mobilized to protect 53 sailors aboard the ships in <LOCATION> Shiogama </LOCATION>, a port city about 190 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said a <ORGANIZATION> Miyagi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prefectural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
 One year after a former top aide accused him of rigging elections, drug trafficking and corruption, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> still firmly controls the government and may well run for president next year. The accusations were made by Col. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> last June after he was demoted from second-in-command. They emboldened thousands of Panamanians to take to the streets to demand <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> was arrested and sent into exile in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. A similar fate befell <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who as president tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief in February after two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grand juries indicted the general on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who went into hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. On Monday, opposition leaders called on Latin American governments to mediate efforts to remove the general from power, a goal <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has failed to achieve through economic sanctions and negotiations. But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has indicated he will not permit any mediation that would ease him out of office and the government already is making plans to hold elections in May 1989 with or without the opposition. Pro-government groups are mentioning <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as a likely candidate of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in next year's presidential elections. A source close to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Monday night that any discussions with Latin American leaders would amount to `` talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by proxy.'' `` And the general is not leaving,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the opposition must understand that.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration announced last month that its effort to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> through negotiations had failed. The widespread, mostly nonviolent opposition demonstrations that began one year ago also failed to loosen the general's grip on power. A Foreign Ministry statement released Monday night assailed the opposition call to `` Latin Americanize the Panamanian crisis'' as an effort `` to hide ... the deliberate execution of a vast plan of internal destabilization'' against the government. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has strengthened his position by forming the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 20 of his closest collaborators. They include the commander of the elite Year 2000 Battalion, another troop commander and key officers in other sections of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces. `` They supersede the <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>,'' said an opposition leader, also speaking privately. `` They are younger than the chiefs of staff and are the ones making all decisions with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' Dr. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the council may have promoted the breakdown in talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` They probably want <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to stay on longer and get rid of the older members'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> command, he said. Chief of Staff Col. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Justines </PERSON>, who negotiated with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives, is not a member of the council. On Monday night <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his generals, dressed in civilian clothes, accompanied president <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> and other top military officers to attend a play depicting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interventions in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The sketch was performed by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>' elite anti-terrorist unit Hundreds of people chanted anti-American slogans and applauded <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as he shook hands with civilians and military recruits.

 A cigarette lighter's flame may have sparked the methane gas explosion in a coal mine shaft that led to the deaths of at least 46 men, a national television network reported. Also Monday, mine owners defended the rescue operation despite the revelation that a radio operator told six trapped miners to get off a radio channel just hours after Wednesday's blast. The six were discovered alive Saturday after officials had insisted there were no signs of life in the <LOCATION> Stolzenbach </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> Borken </LOCATION>, 72 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. A statement from the rescue team said searchers had found another miner's body early today, bringing the total confirmed dead to 47. Four men were still missing in the mine's north field, which officials said had the highest concentrations of deadly carbon monoxide. Prosecutors are investigating whether an open flame may have ignited the gas explosion, the <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network reported Monday night. ZDF, quoting unidentified officials, said cigarette lighters were found inside the mine. It said miners were known to have smoked on the job, but a mining official said he doubted that was true. `` We have very strict regulations against smoking in the mine, and if someone were to be caught doing it they would be immediately fired,'' said <PERSON> Wulf </PERSON> <PERSON> Boettcher </PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> Preussen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elektra </ORGANIZATION> utility company that operates the <LOCATION> Borken </LOCATION> mine. <LOCATION> Kassel </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> <PERSON> Walcher </PERSON> said a full investigation was launched into the cause of the disaster. But he refused to elaborate or to say whether a cigarette lighter may have caused the explosion. High concentrations of carbon monoxide inside the mine delayed search efforts on Monday. Exhausted rescuers were forced to renew their oxygen supplies repeatedly. Authorities said that because of the deadly carbon monoxide fumes, there was little chance the missing miners would be found alive. Owners of the coal mine acknowledged Sunday that a radio operator told the six surviving miners to stop sending messages from the pocket of air where they were trapped because he thought they were another search team. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON>, a technical director for <ORGANIZATION> Preussen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elekta </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Monday that failure to recognize the radio contact as a sign of life from the trapped miners had not endangered the men. `` We knew that the area -LRB- where the men were found -RRB- presented the best possibility of finding survivors, and that's where we began drilling,'' <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said. The six were finally discovered after their sounds were picked up by a television crew's microphone lowered into a shaft 500 feet beneath the earth.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>, sole manufacturer of solid-fuel space shuttle boosters blamed for the Challenger disaster, has dropped out of the competition for a $ 1.2 billion contract to make boosters for the 1990s. The Chicago-based company announced Monday that it wants to concentrate on redesigning the booster used on Challenger, whose fiery disintegration shortly after takeoff killed all seven astronauts aboard. A presidential commission blamed the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion on a plume of hot gas that leaked through a joint in a Thiokol-built solid-fuel booster, igniting the main fuel tank. The motor redesign is almost complete, with a test firing set for next month at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, a company spokesman in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> plant was the sole manufacturer of shuttle boosters, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admininistration </ORGANIZATION> must look elsewhere for producers of the next-generation version, the advanced solid rocket motor. `` One of the principal reasons that <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> is not bidding is because we are acutely aware of our responsibilities in the redesigned solid rocket motor program,'' <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>, the company's group vice president for aerospace, said in an announcement released in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans to use <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s redesigned motor when it resumes shuttle flights. The advanced motor will be used in the mid-1990s, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> anticipates healthy competition for the advanced booster contract despite <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s decision, agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Keegan </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Less than two months ago, <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> officials insisted the company would compete for the $ 1.2 billion contract. Although bidding has not opened, <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said three other parties have expressed interest: <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>, a team of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aerojet </ORGANIZATION>, and another team consisting of <LOCATION> Hercules </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement followed an earlier <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> announcement that it wanted to build a government-owned plant to produce the larger rocket motors and have a private manufacturer operate the plant under contract. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has earmarked $ 27 million of its current budget for design and initial construction of a new booster plant somewhere on the Gulf Coast. Officials have said they plan to add $ 65 million from next year's budget for the project. They estimate it will take at least 10 years to make the plant operational. The proposal to shift shuttle booster construction from <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s plant to a government-owned factory near water was criticized earlier this year as unfair to <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> by state and company officials and members of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation The critics included Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> and Republican Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>. A hearing requested by <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s plans is scheduled before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, which makes and sells chemicals, rockets and salt, plans to invest $ 200 million in coming years to modernize its northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> plant in order to seek other space and defense business, <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. The plant 90 miles north of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is one of the state's largest private employers, with 2,500 workers <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> intends to go after the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> advanced launch system, a strap-on booster and other contracts, <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. The company's announcement got a negative reaction on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> shares fell $ 1.125 to close at $ 39.875 in trading Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> investment firm in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said that if <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> pursued the advanced shuttle rocket contract `` they are, in effect raising questions about their own current designs. The company feels they have a good design.'' <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON> said the company may believe that the advanced rocket program may not be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and that the redesign program for the Challenger rocket will be. `` There's been a lot of speculation that the company will sell the aerospace business and is not willing to commit to it in the long term,'' he said. <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> intends to keep the aerospace unit, which contributes 40 percent of company sales.

<HEAD>Bomb Kills Soldier, Wounds Four as Indians Begin Pullout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Separatist Tamil rebels blew up an <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> army jeep today, killing one soldier and wounding four just hours before hundreds of Indian troops began boarding nearby ships to return home. One Sri Lankan officer called the attack `` a show of strength'' by the rebels, who have fought a five-year war for greater autonomy. Indian officials said their at least partial troop withdrawal would go on as scheduled. Sri Lankan military officers said the jeep was patrolling about six miles south of the port city of <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> when the rebels detonated a mine under it. Just a few hours later, Indian sodliers began pulling out as scheduled in <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION>, 140 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. `` It was a show of strength by the rebels,'' said the Sri Lankan officer, who can not be identified under briefing rules. `` It's a slap in the face.'' The Indian High Commission, or embassy, confirmed the attack but gave no details. But Deputy High Commissioner <PERSON> Nirupam </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said the attack did not affect the pullout of the first contingent of Indian peacekeeping soldiers and weapons, including Soviet-made T-72 tanks and 105mm and 120mm artillery. At least 3,000 of the estimated 50,000 Indian soldiers in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> were scheduled to depart for home today by ship from <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION>. Indian Defense Minister K.C. <PERSON> Pant </PERSON> said last week that `` excess troops and armor'' would be sent home but announced no firm timetable for a complete withdrawal. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> began sending in soldiers last July to enforce a peace accord aimed at ending the civil war on this island off its southern coast. The deployment increased in October after rebels renounced the peace plan, refused to surrender their weapons and resumed fighting. The Indian troops, stationed only in the north and east where Tamils are in the majority, had been ordered to disarm the rebel fighters. Predominantly Hindu Tamils comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and claim they are discriminated against by the mostly <PERSON> Buddhist </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON>, who constitute 75 percent of the population and control the government and military. The peace accord reached by the <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the Sri Lankan government of President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> calls for election of district councils to give the nation's nine provinces greater autonomy. Elections have been held in six provinces so far, and voting is scheduled for Thursday in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>. Balloting has been postponed in the Tamil-dominated Northern and Eastern provinces because of the fighting. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, a major regional power, negotiated the peace accord and agreed to police it partly for fear of sympathies that its own 60 million Tamils feel for the rebel cause. Though the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> have been unable to stem the fighting, a string of recent victories led them to agree with <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> on at least a partial pullout. The Indian presence has been criticized by many Sinhalese, who view it as a threat to Sri Lankan independence.

<HEAD>Feds Halt Offshore Oil Lease Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opponents of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's proposal for extensive oil leasing off the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast claimed credit for the decision to suspend the plan, but said they remain wary it wo n't be scuttled Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> late Monday made the announcement to halt work on the proposal to lease 1.1 million offshore acres. The decision effectively pushes the sale back at least until to August 1989. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s action came on the eve of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary and a day after Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> softened his pro-drilling stance and called for the offshore plan to be delayed. `` I take that as good news,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a one-time <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman who previously had expressed unconditional support for drilling, said when informed of <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s decision while campaigning in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Democratic presidential hopefuls <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have advocated stopping all offshore drilling. `` This is an attempt to try to get <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> off the hook,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Charter </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist who represents <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coastal communties in their fight against the drilling. He said the announcement also could be an effort to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from imposing a one-year moratorium on the sale. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled on Wednesday to consider such a plan to delay leasing until 1990. Anmother critic, <LOCATION> Humboldt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesbro </PERSON>, said, `` We've succeeded beyond our wildest dreams in making this an issue of importance to the national campaign.'' However, he added, `` Temporary political delays are great, but they're not what we're looking for.'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said in a statement that `` it appears that no valid public purpose would be served by preparation and publication of a final environmental impact statement containing a proposed course of action for Lease Sale 91.'' The department estimates that the area proposed for the lease could contain up to 790 million barrels of oil _ a two-month supply for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ and between 820 billion and 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. It says there is a 50-50 chance of finding the petroleum. The proposed lease sale of tracts off <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Humboldt </LOCATION> counties had been tentatively scheduled for February 1989, pending a decision by the next administration. At least six months is needed between the report's conclusion and a sale, due to hearings and other preparatory work. Department spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> said the environmental report could have been prepared as early as August. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> indicated he was reluctant to take the action. `` I believe we do not have to choose between development of offshore oil or protection of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast,'' he said. `` Experience shows we can have both.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier Monday for `` coming around'' to his latest position `` kind of late.'' And, the Democratic front-runner said: `` It's easy to say, ` We'll delay it until after the election. What does that mean?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides acknowledged that his statement on Sunday represented a major concession to strong bipartisan environmental sentiments in the state. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recognizes the importance of environmental and quality-of-life issues in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' said chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. Charter said that if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> becomes president, <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s action represents `` only a six-month reprieve for Lease Sale 91.'' The lobbyist said the vice president has not made a clear commitment to do away with the sale, noting that `` There are a lot of qualifiers in his statement.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said it supported <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s decision for `` a reasonable delay. `` We're political realists,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, a spokesman for the industry group. `` Right now, it is clear that the people of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ especially the people of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ are not comfortable with the environmental studies that now exist.''

<HEAD>World of Play Can Be Harsh for Migrant Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WIMAUMA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While most kids spend their time playing with toy trucks and tractors, migrant children often play in the hot, dusty strawberry fields of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with the real thing. The harsh world of heavy equipment and soil-cutting tools can mean deep gashing wounds, burns, severed limbs and sometimes, loss of life. It was in one of those strawberry patches on an April day last year that 7-year-old <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Polanco </PERSON> nearly lost her leg as she dangled it over the rear of a truck while her parents picked strawberries nearby. Somebody wanted the truck moved, so her 12-year-old playmate hopped in the front seat, shifted into reverse and slammed <PERSON> Karla </PERSON>'s leg between the rig and a trailer And last week, 5-year-old <PERSON> Fidencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaurequi </PERSON>'s right arm was ripped off at a <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> farm when he accidentally stuck it in a tomato sorting machine while his mother worked nearby. Doctors were unable to reattach the limb because the injury was so severe. The boy was listed in good condition Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. With their parents working in the fields from sunrise to sunset and few available day-care services, hundreds of migrant children are left to fend for themselves in empty homes or busy fields. `` We see the evidence all the time _ cut fingers because the children stuck them in a fan, burns because the children were hungry and tried to cook something to eat while their parents were off at work,'' said <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON>, a former migrant who runs a day-care program in <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In the camps where migrants live, stories abound of children maimed or killed in accidents in the fields. Many accidents go unreported to authorities as families move on to other states, migrants say. `` I remember this one woman some years back who brought a 6-month-old baby out into the fields,'' said <PERSON> Concha </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, who has four children. `` The baby got too hot out there and died. She did n't have anybody to watch it.'' There is no reliable estimate of the largely undocumented migrant farmworker population in southern <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but social workers guess there are between 25,000 and 45,000 people. The <ORGANIZATION> Redlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the county's primary provider of migrant day care, has only 668 available spots for migrant children and a waiting list of 575. There are many more out there, but they do n't qualify for programs like Migrant Headstart because they did n't travel as farmworkers during the year, experts say. `` Even a few years ago I would say there were a lot of workers still traveling back and forth, from state to state,'' Ms. <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON> said. `` But now I think more are just staying here and working odd jobs during the summer because you just ca n't make as much money traveling any more.''

<TEXT>
 Air <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s wide-bodied stewardesses have met a six-month deadline to lose weight or stay on the ground, a newspaper reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said stewardesses who were told in December to trim down or face permanent grounding have shed their excess baggage. It did not say how many were involved. In December, the airline gave the jumbo jet attendants the ultimatum after admitting that its cabin crews outweighed those of most other airlines. Officials said at the time that some stewardesses were so big their thighs bumped passengers as they walked between the aisles. The newspaper, which is published by government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, today quoted an unidentified airline spokesman as saying the stewardesses have lost weight and resumed normal duties. Airline officials today declined to elaborate. Regulations set the minumum height for stewardesses at 5 feet 4 inches and require that employees are proportionate in weight.

<HEAD>Company Agrees to Pay $15 Million in Fines, Clean Up Disposal Sites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pipeline company has been fined a record $ 15 million and ordered to clean up its disposal sites containing toxic PCBs in 14 states. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the 10-year cleanup, which could cost $ 400 million, in a proposed consent decree filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. The cleanup will take place at up to 89 gas pipeline compressor stations along the company's 10,000-mile-long pipeline, which runs through <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The company used lubricating oil containing PCBs, a fire retardant, in turbine compressors and regularly dumped liquids including the PCBs in pits until May 1987, officials said. PCBs, polychlorinated biphenyls, are a suspected carcinogen believed to cause birth defects, miscarriages, reproductive failures and tumors. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> also burned pipeline liquids including PCBs in open pits at many of the 89 locations as late as 1979 and the combustion process may have created residues of dioxin, another hazardous waste. The $ 15 million penalty will be `` a sharp reminder that failure to comply with the environmental laws will strike a heavy blow to the pocketbooks of would-be violators,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Marzulla </PERSON>, assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s land and natural resources division The fine is a record in civil penalties for violations of federal environmental law in disposing of the PCBs and associated pipeline fluids. The anticipated $ 400 million cleanup also appeared to be a record for a private party in a federal environmental case, <PERSON> Marzulla </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, who heads the environmental oversight panel, said the settlement was long overdue. He accused the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> for not acting fast enough. `` It's too bad that we had to drag <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> by the collar to get them to take this action,'' said <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>. But <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said, `` It is largely as a result of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s own investigation'' that the settlement was worked out. `` Looking back at an investigation of this scope, I suppose that there are points here and there where it might have been possible to expedite matters a little faster,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. `` But when all things are considered, what we got was an excellent resolution.'' Under the decree, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> must clean up any sites at which <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> contamination is found in concentrations greater than 25 parts per million in areas where public access is restricted. In sites open to the public, the company must clean up concentrations greater than 10 parts per million. The decree also requires extensive sampling and analysis of soil on and off the sites as well as of streams and groundwater. The groundwater monitoring program may continue for up to 20 years. The company said it will seek recovery of the cleanup costs from insurance and other claims through rate hikes. It said it believes the $ 15 million penalty is `` inappropriate'' but agreed to pay it `` in order to expedite the settlement'' and avoid `` the uncertainties of litigation.''

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who meets with the Soviet foreign minister this week, chided <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for seeking a political deal to improve relations but referred to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as a `` great leader.'' `` The Soviets keep hinting that they will renew diplomatic relations with us if we agree to their proposal for an international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in a speech here Monday. `` I do n't believe we should pay for the resumption of diplomatic relations.

In an interview published in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who has instituted reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` My observation is, to bring a new message, a new idea to such a great country, it could be done only by a great leader,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the Times. Less than two years ago, the leader of the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> party described the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as `` old wine in new bottles.''

 The state decided not to prosecute former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> for urging supporters to hide their support for him if called for jury duty in his criminal trial, as prosecutors prepared to rest their case. `` We do not believe it is a prosecutable case,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said Monday, referring to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s comments in April. `` Some say it was a joke. Some say it was n't a joke. It is a case we do not wish to pursue.'' Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON> said he expects to rest his case today after testimony by accountant <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who told jurors Monday the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> campaign was badly overdrawn when it received a $ 350,000 loan in October 1986. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, his brother and 1986 campaign treasurer, are charged with concealing the loan on financial reports required by the state. They have denied the charges. `` They have n't proved anything,'' the ousted <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor told reporters Monday. Prosecutors have failed to present anything `` that has n't been public information for seven months.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> says he was joking when he said at an April 18 Republican legislative district meeting that supporters, if called for jury duty in his trial, should `` have a lapse of memory'' regarding their support for him. Four days later, <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> began an investigation into whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> violated any law, including one that prohibits asking somebody to commit a crime or help commit a crime. `` I do n't know why he opened the investigation in the first place,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said after being told of <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s decision. `` Anyone who knows anything about the statement knows it was said tongue-in-cheek at a private meeting.'' On Monday, former top gubernatorial aide <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> testified that she warned <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> during the campaign to distance himself from the man who loaned him the money, <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON>. Also, former <ORGANIZATION> Mecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasser </PERSON> read the jury a set of notes he took during a committee meeting in the fall of 1986. The notes say `` show <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> borrowed money'' and `` do n't show borrowed money,'' and some say they appear to reflect a discussion on whether to disclose the loan. However, <PERSON> Gasser </PERSON> said he could n't recall the conversation or what the notes meant. <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> allowed <PERSON> Gasser </PERSON> to read the notes despite defense objections. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is charged with six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents, and faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted on all counts. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> faces three similar counts and up to 9 -LCB- years in prison if convicted. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> took office in January 1987. He was removed from office April 4 when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of two unrelated impeachment counts.

<HEAD>Showdown Over Restoration of Lost Wages</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 4,500 wood mill workers went on strike in three states in a showdown over efforts to restore wages and benefits lost two years ago. `` We're prepared to stay out till doomsday, and the way things are going that may not be very long,'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a union local president in Sweet Home, said as the strike began Monday. The strike shut down 18 wood products operations in the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, affecting <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> DAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION>. The walkout followed the collapse last week of negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woodworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America-U.S. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. The Portland-based unions have vowed to restore wages and benefits lost in 1986 after a series of unsuccessful strikes. `` We already took a 17 percent wage cut and two-year freeze,'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said as he walked a picket line outside a <LOCATION> Willamette </LOCATION> sawmill in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We'd have another two-year freeze if we accept -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION>'s last offer -RRB-. That does n't cut it.'' The first step toward restoration was taken last week when the unions announced a tentative agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Bohemia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>. The four-year pact largely restored wages lost two years ago, union officials said. The unions want to use the <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION> agreement as an industry standard, but other companies have rejected it. The International Woodworkers bargains for 450 workers at Champion's <LOCATION> Roseburg </LOCATION> plywood plant. The other union represents about 200 Champion workers at a <LOCATION> Klickitat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, sawmill, and 1,800 Champion workers at sawmills and plywood plants at <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Libby </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. The two unions also represent about 1,300 <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> workers at five lumber mills, four plywood mills, two wood products plants, a machine shop and a logging shop operated by <LOCATION> Willamette </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sweet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. The International Woodworkers also represents a DAW sawmill in Bend and the other union represents a DAW plywood plant in <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>. Each mill has about 400 union workers. <PERSON> Willamette </PERSON> spokeswoman said the company's three-year offer included bonuses the first two years and a 3.5 percent wage increase the third year. The average plywood worker makes $ 9.77 per hour, she said. Union leaders oppose bonuses because the base wage rate remains the same, although annual wages are boosted. Industry sources say <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION> offered increases of 5 percent the first year and 4 percent in each of the next three years. In 1986, the International Woodworkers and the Lumber, Production and Industrial Workers, which later became the WCIW, staged a 5 -LCB- - week strike against <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION>, affecting 7,500 workers in the biggest regional timber walkout in the last 25 years That year, 1,100 other workers walked off their jobs at <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and other job actions struck DAW, <ORGANIZATION> WI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION> and Champion International.

<HEAD>Justice Minister Resigns in Palme Probe Scandal</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Justice Minister <PERSON> Anna-Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> resigned today after disclosures she authorized an unsupervised freelance investigation into the 1986 assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>. Her resignation was intended to head off a vote of no-confidence in Parliament that could have toppled the minority government of <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> said he regretted Mrs. <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON>'s departure and would likely appoint her to a new Cabinet if his <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is returned to office after elections next September. Opposition leaders accused her of overstepping her authority by bypassing the official investigation into the Palme killing and approving a secret probe by publisher <PERSON> Ebbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>, who is not related to the prime minister. Public furor grew over reports the publisher's government-assigned bodyguard was caught smuggling illegal wiretapping equipment into <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and that the probe was funded by a $ 343,000 contribution from a banker <PERSON> Bengt </PERSON> <PERSON> Westerberg </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, said questions remained about the role in the unauthorized probe of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, which supplied <PERSON> Ebbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> with a bodyguard and unofficial support. The publisher was investigating possible Iranian involvement in <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION>'s murder. Under the theory, <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was killed because he uncovered and tried to halt illegal arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by a private weapons manufacturer. <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bildt </PERSON> welcomed Mrs. <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON>'s resignation `` If people want to remain confident in their faith in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> as a society of justice, this was the only possible decision,'' he said. The prime minister said Industry Minister <PERSON> Thage </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> would be acting justice minister until the next election. Mrs. <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON>, 49, was the third justice minister to resign since the Social Democrats took office in 1982. In October, <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickbom </PERSON> quit after a convicted spy escaped while on an unguarded conjugal furlough from prison. In 1983, <PERSON> Ove </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> resigned for allegedly taking advantage of tax loopholes. Analysts said the Leijon affair threatened to hurt the Social Democrats in balloting next September. An opinion survey published last weekend showed the Social Democrats polling 44.7 percent against a combined 43.5 percent for the three non-socialist opposition parties. The balance of power is held by the small <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Social Democrats, who have been in office for all but six years since World War II, have 159 seats in the 349-member legislature.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Federal Agents Seize Cash from Robinson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 Federal agents seized $ 21,000 in cash from the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> apartment and business office of <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s half-brother, newspapers reported today. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 45, was arrested Saturday in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, on charges of hiring someone to attack a witness in the slaying of a former employee. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has denied the charges and accused officials of targeting him because of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s high profile and of trying to turn him into `` the <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotenburg </PERSON>, said cash seized was from <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s chain of fast food restaurants, according to today's editions of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Tribune and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Rotenburg </LOCATION>'s office telephones went unanswered Monday night, and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuntzelman </PERSON> said no information could be released. The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> also said federal authorities had seized the records of <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s businesses in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and were examining them. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> on Monday posted $ 50,000 on a $ 500,000 bond on charges of accessory to a felony, intimidation of a witness, obstruction of justice and conspiracy. `` I have never been involved in criminal anything,'' he told courtroom observers and reporters while awaiting his bond hearing. Police arrested another man at <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> residence on Sunday and charged him with being an accessory to the stabbing of the witness, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON>, who survived the attack in her <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> apartment in December 1987. Ms. <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON> was a witness to the murder of <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> `` Hambone'' <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, a former employee of <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> who was shot outside a building owned by <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> in downtown <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, authorities said. The man arrested in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> apartment, <PERSON> Holandus </PERSON> `` Jake'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, 41, was named as a co-conspirator in one of the warrants filed against <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, but authorities declined to elaborate on what role <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> allegedly played in the stabbing. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> worked for him in 1974 and recently watched <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s apartment in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> when he was out of town. Bond for <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> was set Monday at $ 100,000. Ms. <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON> was stabbed after testifying before a grand jury about <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>'s death. She later recanted her testimony. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he believes the charges against him stem from his attempts to help ex-convicts and others in need and from political forces trying to derail <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. <ORGANIZATION> Greenville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s arrest `` has nothing to do with political motivations. When we felt we had enough to charge him and arrest him that's what we did. We treated this case like any other case.''

<HEAD>Computer Glitch Causes Data To Vanish From Air Traffic Controller
Screens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Critical information is disappearing momentarily from air traffic controllers' screens in airports for <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> because of a computer glitch, a newspaper reported today. Information on altitude, airspeed, aircraft types, call signs and destinations vanish from radar screens for up to 20 seconds, said the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Morning News, quoting <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials do not believe the error in a computer program presents a hazard to safety, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrent </PERSON>, assistant air traffic manager at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said Monday. `` The radar has not failed,'' <PERSON> Parrent </PERSON> said. `` The primary target is still there.'' The radar image and a four-digit number assigned to each aircraft, known as a `` target'' by controllers, remain on the screen. Controllers are concerned about the glitch and are monitoring the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s progress in fixing it, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON>, a local representative of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a new program and there are some software problems,'' he said. `` I do n't think that's anything unusual. We're not totally comfortable with it, but they're working hard on the system.'' The information disappears when the program `` detects a glitch in the system,'' <PERSON> Parrent </PERSON> said. When information is about to disappear, an alarm sounds, and controllers have up to five seconds to write down the information or memorize it, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials told the Morning News. Controllers handle up to 10 aircraft at a time. The new program offers many features that improve the margin of safety, and `` bugs'' will be worked out, <PERSON> Parrent </PERSON> said. However, the newspaper said some aviation experts and controllers voiced concern that, although horizontal distance between aircraft still can be tracked on the screen, the glitch could cause problems. The risk is exacerbated if the problem occurs when aircraft are in a holding pattern because of bad weather, said <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Nahmi </PERSON>, a California-based airline captain and air safety investigator. It is common for aircraft to be in holding patterns with altitude separations of 1,000 feet in weather that severely limits visibility, <PERSON> Nahmi </PERSON> said. If a pilot deviated from an assigned altitude when information disappeared, the controller would be unable to detect the change, and a collision would be likely, he said. <PERSON> Parrent </PERSON> acknowleged the glitches have made some controllers uneasy. `` It does cause tense moments in the control room,'' he said. `` But we would not run that program if there was a derogation of safety.''

 Radical students threw firebombs and rocks at police and barricaded streets today and their leaders vowed to defy the government and march to communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to press for reunification. Fierce fighting erupted around <ORGANIZATION> Soongshil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> when radical students screaming anti-government slogans poured out of the school to attack riot police. Several officers hit by firebombs were covered in orange flames before other police extinguished the fires. Radical students from across the capital had gathered at the school to mourn a Shoonshil student who died Monday of wounds suffered when he set fire to himself two days earlier in an anti-government protest. `` Down with the military dictatorship'' and `` Yankee go home,'' masked students yelled as they hurled firebombs, rocks and bricks at riot troopers huddling behind shields. Police also hurled rocks. Police rifle squads and armored vans fired hundreds of rounds of tear gas, but were forced back from the road in front of the school several times by students armed with wooden poles and iron bars. Students blocked one road with two 15-foot-high basketball backboards. Several police officers and students were injured by rocks and other missiles, but police had no figures. Police did not report any arrests. The front of thecampus was draped in black mourning cloth and protest banners as students inside the school stood watch over the coffin of Park Rae-chun. Park was the third student to commit ritual suicide as an anti-government protest since May 15. Fighting erupted after a procession of students bearing Park's body marched from a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> hospital In the southern city of <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION>, students tried to march out of <ORGANIZATION> Hannam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, but were driven back by riot police firing tear gas. Radical students held peaceful rallies at other colleges in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities to prepare for a march Friday to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in an attempt to unify the two Koreas. `` March to the border to realize unification and drive out the foreign forces from our land,'' said a leader at a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Joongang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. National Police Director <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> <PERSON> Chong-suk </PERSON> said the march plans were a threat to national security and that students defying the ban on the march would be arrested and prosecuted. `` Any attempts to take part in the action or any other illegal acts will be dealt with severely,'' <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> warned in a statement. Up to 60,000 riot police will be deployed to prevent students marching from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to the border and to step up security around key government buildings and college campuses, police officials said. Radical students planned to march to the border truce site of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, which is off limits to civilians, to meet with North Korean students. Opposition parties urged the government to hold talks with student leaders to reach a peaceful settlement rather than resort to a violent crackdown. But the opposition disagrees with the march, saying contacts with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> must be left to official channels. Police arrested 148 students in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Sunday when they tried to go to the edge of the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas for a rally to promote Friday's march. The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, insist that the two Koreas must be reunited at all costs. They say they are not pro-communist. Student leaders claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enforces partition of the peninsula, divided since 1945, so it can rule <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as a virtual colony. Radicals have been demanding the withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based here under a defense pact. But many <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> believe <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is determined to forcefully unite the peninsula under its control. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which invaded <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1950 and sparked the Korean War, has staged attacks against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> over the years.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> praised the Japanese government for taking on a greater share of its own defense, but urged it to contribute more toward Western security. Speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has in this decade taken on defense of sea-lanes up to 1,000 miles offshore and begun a five-year procurement plan of beefing up its forces. He said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had done away with its self-imposed limit of spending just 1 percent of its gross national product on defense and that the government had also pledged to pay all non-salary allowances and expenses for Japanese workers on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases here by 1990. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> does more than it often gets credit for,'' he said. `` I want to make equally clear today that still more remains to be done.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to increase defense spending, since the current program provides for what he called `` the minimum capability <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> needs to fulfill the defense obligations it has assumed.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also should increase its financial support for maintaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel stationed here, which costs the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government $ 3 billion annually, he said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also called on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to boost overseas economic aid to such developing nations such as <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which he called `` nations in which aid could advance our overall security.'' He said the West should strengthen controls on its exports to the East to keep its technological lead over the Soviet bloc and should not be lulled by last week's superpower summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Until we see some tangible changes we should not change our policies,'' he said. `` We are still facing a serious military threat.''

<HEAD>Demonstrators Block Demolition of Buildings Around Golden Temple</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEEPAK SHARMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least 1,000 demonstrators today blocked the government from wrecking buildings around the Golden Temple to create a security corridor free of hiding places for Sikh militants, authorities said. The crowd gathered on a road and prevented construction vehicles from moving in to demolish the buildings within 30 yards of the holiest shrine of the Sikh religion. Sikh militants have used the temple as a base in their battle for an independent homeland. Militants shot and killed a Sikh couple at a village near <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> on Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. The killings raised to 1,259 the number of people killed this year in attacks blamed on Sikh radicals. Many of the victims have been members of the majority Hindu community, but the militants have also targeted moderate Sikhs. Most of the demonstrators in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> were tenants of the affected buildings, an <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> district government official said. The demonstrators were demanding that they be provided alternate housing before they were evicted, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said senior government officials were negotiating with the demonstrators. `` The demolitions will not begin until the problem is resolved,'' he said. Plans for the security corridor were launched after a 10-day police siege of the temple ended on May 18. More than 200 militants surrendered to police during the siege that left 46 people dead, including 41 suspected radicals and five civilians caught in crossfire.. Police found it difficult to maintain a cordon around the shrine because the maze of alleys, shops and houses next to the complex provided cover for radicals <PERSON> Sarbjeet </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, the top government officer in the district, said workers would demolish 522 properties by the end of the year and create a corridor 1.7 miles in circumference. The entire project, scheduled to be completed within two years, was expected to cost $ 115 million, which would include expenses to buy the land and relocate families and businesses, he said. Sikhs form 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people but are in a majority in northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, where <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> is. Sikh militants have been agitating since 1982 for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. They say they are discriminated against by <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON>, who comprise 80 percent of the country's population.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was re-elected speaker of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament today, consolidating his hold on political and military power. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s re-election came five days after <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> named him commander-in-chief of the armed forces in the wake of two major battlefield defeats in the war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said 187 of the 192 parliamentary deputies whose credentials have been approved since elections in April and May voted for <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. Five abstained. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, 53, has been speaker since 1980. Radicals, including many <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> supporters, made sweeping gains in the elections at the expense of conservatives, who have blocked economic reforms. The credentials of other elected deputies in the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament, have either been passed to an investigating committee for scrutiny following objections from other deputies or have not yet been approved, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is also <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s representative on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which determines <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s strategy in the 7 -LCB- - year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> He sits on the Council for the Expediency of State Decrees, formed earlier this year by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to push radical economic reforms through parliament. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has strong links with the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, which is now more powerful than the Iranian army. The 87-year-old <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, patriarch of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic revolution, has been reported in poor health. Speculation that his condition was deteriorating was heightened when he relinquished his constitutional position as commander-in-chief to <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, a middle-ranking cleric. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has designated a senior cleric, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein-Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, as his successor. But many leading figures, including <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, oppose <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s appointment underlined that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who has long been close to the patriarch, retains his confidence and is being groomed to hold great power in the post-Khomeini era. The election was the most fiercely contested since the Islamic revolution toppled the <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> in 1979. The gains in parliament by the radicals, supported by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, prompted allegations by some prominent conservatives who failed to win re-election that the polling was rigged. It sharpened divisions between radicals, seeking a centralized state-run economy, and the conservatives, who are backed by the wealthy merchant class. The elections touched off clashes between <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> supporters backed by the Revolutionary Guards and protesters in several cities, diplomatic sources reported. Several people were reported killed when the guards opened fire on demonstrators. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s best known opposition politician, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazargan </PERSON>, distributed an open letter last week accusing <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> of `` erroneous policies'' in the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and making the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> an object of hate around the world. Reports reaching <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Bazargan </PERSON>'s criticism triggered a wave of arrests, but it was not known if <PERSON> Bazargan </PERSON> himself had been detained. <PERSON> Bazargan </PERSON>'s small <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> is the only opposition faction permitted to function openly in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and has been constantly harassed by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> militants in recent years.

 Striking scriptwriters ended a 12-hour negotiating session with television producers early today, scheduling a fifth straight day of talks as the walkout enters its 14th week. `` We're not characterizing how the meeting went,'' <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said early today when asked if the continuing talks meant some hope for a breakthrough.

The next round of talks was scheduled for 1:30 this afternoon, she added. The two sides began meeting Friday. Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> declined to comment on the issues discussed. The writers walked out March 7 in a dispute centering on payments or residuals for reruns of one-hour television shows. Demand for such programs in rerun, or syndication, is declining, and the producers want to tie payments to a show's success in the rerun market. The two sides also have been at odds over writers' demands for more creative control over changes made in scripts during filming and more on - and off-screen credit The guild has signed full-term contracts with about 80 independent producers, but the alliance contends none of its large members has signed and the producers who did defect employ only a fraction of the writers.

<TEXT>
 Political discontent among <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students broke into the open today as students put up illegal posters demanding democracy and criticizing government corruption. Dozens of anonymous posters blanketed bulletin boards on campus and spilled onto nearby buildings, some with large characters scrawled in black paint on sheets of newspaper and others written in tiny characters on notebook pages. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> faces an all-out crisis,'' said one poster. `` The most basic human rights are imperiled.'' Several posters demanded a more open press, complaining that Chinese often learn about events in their own country through the foreign media. One quoted the preamble to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Declaration of Independence, with its defense of `` life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'' Students said they planned to march Wednesday from campus to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the symbolic center of power in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, to dramatize their demands. Street marches are illegal without police permission. A graduate student at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> slain last week in a brawl outside a liquor store. On Friday, about 1,000 students marched to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and met with officials to demand improved security and the arrest of the killers. Police arrested six suspects within 48 hours of the killing. Since Friday, hundreds of students have gathered nightly around campus bulletin boards, holding debates and encouraging each other to draw a larger lesson from the killing. `` People are concerned about more than just this incident,'' said one girl. `` They want to do something for the living.'' Several times in recent months university students have put up posters criticizing government bureaucracy and demanding more state funds for education. The new posters repeated those themes, but also demanded democracy and freedom for the first time since pro-democracy protests swept <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the winter of 1986-87. Those protests, in which thousands of students marched through <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other major cities, led to a government crackdown on liberalism and the ouster of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> for his alleged tolerance toward the students. Students since have been careful not to raise the themes of democracy and freedom. A <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> freshman said today that students are divided over whether agitation now will help or hurt the cause of democracy. `` The <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was the most democratic ever,'' he said, referring to the national legislative session held in March and April, at which delegates were encouraged for the first time to debate selected issues. `` We see democracy moving forward slowly. But if conditions become upset, the government will again rule with a firm hand,'' he said. `` Perhaps the steps we take will not lead us to our goals _ perhaps just the opposite.'' Other students acknowledged that they lack the support of wider groups in society. Most urban workers are more concerned with the 11 percent inflation rate than such abstract issues as democracy. One poster urged the students to join in the planned march Wednesday to `` propagate among the masses the necessity of democracy and rule of law.'' Another claimed, `` A small breeze at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> can raise up a storm nationwide.'' One poster accused the government of paying more attention to crushing student protests than stamping out official corruption. `` Even a dog that is wronged gives a few barks. But we <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students are n't even as good as a dog,'' it taunted, challeging students to speak out.

<TEXT>
 A leading critic of House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said today he is n't sure <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was wrong in using an aide to help write a book, but the speaker's activities should be investigaged. The aide was paid $ 2,000 from official congressional accounts for expenses during a 1984 trip to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to oversee final editing of a privately published book by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> records show. `` I'm not sure, frankly, whether we have a problem here or not with this particular case,'' Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., said on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> show `` This Morning. `` There's clearly a legitimate public policy role served in writing books,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said, `` The question would come, whether the primary job of that staffer was to write a book which was being written purely for profit, or whether that was a natural part of his job, doing something that reflected a public policy interest.'' `` I think every member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has at times used their staff in a legitimate way to look at serious public policy pronouncements or serious efforts to influence public policy,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said. But he reiterated previous calls for a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s activities. Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., also said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> should be investigated <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he does n't consider accusations against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> valid, but feels that an investigation would help restore public confidence. The book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' published by a longtime <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> friend of the speaker, brought <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> nearly $ 55,000 in royalties. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>, who has since left <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staff, said in a telephone interview Monday that his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> trip was the culmination of several months of on-and-off work in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> office to help the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat draft the book's manuscript. House ethical guidelines allow wide latitude in the use of staff members, but stipulate that `` Employees may not be compensated from public funds to perform nonofficial, personal or campaign activities on behalf of the member.'' Records maintained by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> show $ 2,078.27 paid to Cossolotto for hotel accommodations `` while on official business,'' car rental and meals from Oct. 22 to Nov. 14, 1984, when <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON> said he was in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> to complete work on the book. At the time, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, the No. 2 leadership post. <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON> said he spent `` a good chunk of time'' _ perhaps 150 to 200 hours _ between mid-1984, when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> assigned him to work on the book at a staff meeting, and his trip to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. The book is largely a compilation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s speeches, sayings and anecdotes. `` It was not full time in any particular week,'' Cossolotto said. `` I would collect some things, read some stuff, talk to the majority leader. It was hit and miss. The big crunch was down in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>.'' During the trip, which was arranged by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office, <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON> said he worked with the publisher, read proofs and made final corrections on the book. He said he flew to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> on a commercial flight, but did not know how that was paid for. The House financial records for the period do not show any air fare attributed to Cossolotto. The book deal was among cases of alleged questionable activities by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> cited in requests for an investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee. The panel met last week without deciding how to proceed, and is scheduled to resume consideration of the matter Thursday. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which first reported the aide's work on the book Monday, <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON> said he was `` a little uncomfortable'' with the assignment and did not know whether it was proper under House rules. Asked Monday whether he reported that uneasiness to any of his superiors, or sought assurances from them, he answered: `` That's sort of a touchy one I'm not sure if I did.'' Earlier news reports have pointed out that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has collected nearly $ 55,000 in royalties from the book, receiving $ 3.25 for each copy of the slim $ 5.95 volume. It was published by <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> friend of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> who also was paid more than $ 250,000 by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s re-election committee in 1985 and 1986, while <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was collecting the royalties. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office would not comment on the matter Monday. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, however, the speaker defended Cossolotto's assignment and said the amount of time the aide had spent was `` rather negligible. `` If he gave some time to try to help put together a book that would demonstrate to the public my philosophy, my basic beliefs, that would n't be too far afield from the public business,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told the newspaper. Another <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> staff member, press aide <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mair </PERSON>, is collaborating with the speaker on a book looking at the history of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over its first 200 years and in particular at those who have held the speaker's office. <PERSON> Mair </PERSON> was hired by the speaker on a short-term contract last Dec. 1, and his $ 65,000-a-year contract was renewed in May. One news account of the contract renewal said <PERSON> Mair </PERSON> was kept on to help with a number of projects, including the book. But <PERSON> Mair </PERSON> said Monday he and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> are working on the book totally outside office hours.

 The Israeli-appointed mayor of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION> was stabbed in the chest today in an apparent assassination attempt by Palestinian militants. The stabbing of <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>, in his 70s, follows repeated demands by underground leaders of the 6-month-old Palestinian uprising that he and scores of other Israeli-appointed officials resign their jobs in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> was taken to nearby <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where officials said he was in stable condition after surgery. He was stabbed once with a `` very long knife'' that pierced his heart, diaphragm, liver and stomach, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Shaike </PERSON> <PERSON> Erez </PERSON>, head of the military government in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> was attacked near the city hall in <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION>, a town of mostly Moslems about nine miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said a knife was found near the scene of the attack. <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Taher </PERSON>, one of four members of the <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION> city council, blamed the attack on Palestinian militants and said, `` I had hoped we would not descend to the level of assassination.'' The army set up roadblocks and imposed a curfew on <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION>, confining the 10,000 residents to their homes. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>, a son of the mayor, said a driver who also acted as a guard was with his father at the time of the attack. He said the man was being questioned by police. Three Israeli soldiers guarded <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>'s room at <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and prevented even family members from entering. When <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> appeared, he said, `` Let me in. I want to see my father.'' But soldiers pushed him away. Two army jeeps were parked outside the hospital and about 20 soldiers surrounded the building. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> condemned the attack. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said it received an anonymous telephone call from a Hebrew-speaking man who took responsibility for the stabbing but did not identify any group as having carried out the attack. The radio quoted him as saying: `` We are sick of the stone throwers. That's why we did it,'' implying the attackers were Jewish extremists. But both diplomatic sources and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalists discounted the call, saying the attack was more likely the work of Palestinian militants. <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> was one of three mayors appointed by the Israeli government in September 1986 as part of an effort to gain cooperation from Palestinian moderates. The <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> mayors replaced <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials who had been running the municipalities. The appointments immediately provoked opposition in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, where Palestinian extremists often have threatened to assassinate those who cooperate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s government. In March 1986, Mayor <PERSON> Zafer </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Masri </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> was slain in front of his office three months after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> appointed him to govern the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city. Last October, two <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> members were sentenced to life in prison for the slaying. Today's attack follows repeated calls in underground leaflets for Israel-appointed mayors and city officials to resign. Such leaflets, signed by the PLO-backed <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION>, have prompted the resignation of about 400 Arab policemen. According to army officials, there are Israeli-appointed mayors in about a dozen towns and cities in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Heads of about 85 village councils also are appointed by the military government. <PERSON> Meron </PERSON> <PERSON> Benveniste </PERSON>, an Israeli expert on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said attacks on such Palestinian officials could be predicted once the uprising began to ebb. `` It was clear that once -LRB- the uprising -RRB- would die down a bit, they would start doing their accounting. They told them to resign and they did n't want to,'' he said. On Monday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops opened fire at rioting Arabs in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> hours after <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shifter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for human rights, toured the area with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>. A 9-month-old Palestinian child lost an eye in the shooting. Three other Arabs were injured Monday in protests in the strip's Jabaliya refugee camp In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a 16-year-old Palestinian boy was wounded when troops chased stone-throwers. Also Monday, the army reopened high schools for 36,000 students in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and released more than 100 Arab teen-agers from jail so they could attend classes. Schools had been closed since February and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said their reopening indicates a waning of the anti-occupation uprising, in which 202 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military government spokesman <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawofitz </PERSON> reported 90 percent attendance that he said showed a wish to return to normal life. But students vowed to stage protests after classes.

 Hundreds of thousands of black workers and students stayed home for a second day today in a nationwide protest strike over apartheid. Police said seven people were killed and more than 20 injured in violence overnight. Strike supporters and transport companies said the protest eased today in many areas and worker attendance increased. But participation near 100 percent was reported in other places. Police reported more than two dozen incidents of violence between Monday evening and dawn today, including many firebombings and stonings of homes, buses and trains. Twenty-one arrests were reported. One black youth was killed by police shotgun fire after municipal officers were stoned, police said. The other six blacks who died, including three children, were killed in shootings and a hand grenade attack in which the assailants were not identified. In the black homeland of <ORGANIZATION> KwaZulu </ORGANIZATION>, hospital officials said a bus passenger injured in a firebomb attack early Monday had died. A bomb caused minor damage to a rail line in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> early today, delaying some trains carrying blacks from the huge black township to jobs in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> union leaders had called for a three-day national protest without specifying a strike. They said the action aims to pressure business leaders into demanding that the white minority government ease restrictions on the anti-apartheid movement. A three-day strike would be the longest nationwide protest since the government decreed an emergency June 12, 1986 to thwart a black revolt against apartheid, the policy of racial separation that reserves power as well as the best schooling and living for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites and denies the country's 26 million blacks a voice in national affairs. The boycott is the most ambitious opposition effort since the government in February banned political activity by major anti-apartheid groups and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the largest black labor federation. Union leaders targeted those prohibitions as well as proposed legislation that would limit the ability of labor unions to strike. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Meintjies </PERSON>, spokesman for the 691,000-member congress, said 3 million people stayed home Monday and about 90 percent of those were still out today. Other estimates said there were about 1 million strikers. Police declined comment on the scope of the strike on grounds that giving publicity to it would break emergency regulations. National police headquarters in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> urged local news media to consult their lawyers on restrictions against subversive statements before publishing stories about the protest. Some business leaders were quoted Monday as saying they intend to enforce a no-work, no-pay policy toward strikers, and Manpower Minister <PERSON> Pieter </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Plessis </PERSON> said strikers risked dismissal because the protest was illegal. The state-run South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said in a radio editorial that the strike represented the strategy of `` those radical activists who want to make <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> ungovernable.'' In <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, schools were empty today and many students were expected to extend a scheduled vacation period starting next week by staying home for the rest of this week. Bus and taxi routes were busier than on Monday. <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, where sidewalks were virtually empty Monday, was nearly as quiet this morning. <ORGANIZATION> PUTCO </ORGANIZATION>, whose 2,400 buses carry 300,000 passengers daily in <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> provinces, said operations were back to normal around <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said service improved from <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> but was still only 25 percent of normal and that the stayaway appeared more than 90 percent effective in townships east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and around the port of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. South African <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said rail commuter traffic was up sharply in most areas. Precious-metal mines, the backbone of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s export earnings, were slightly affected, with one gold mine and three diamond mines reporting significant stayaways Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest mining company, said absenteeism was heavy Monday at two of its coal mines, and that one mine was still affected Tuesday. Milk and bread deliveries were curtailed in some areas around <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. Hospital services there and in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> were reported running smoothly. In some areas around <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> where transport was disrupted, police used large trucks to carry people to the nearest working bus routes. All of the country's seven major automobile assembly plants remained closed. The union call for a protest was endorsed last week by leading anti-apartheid clergymen and the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement said the economy `` must grind to a halt.''

<HEAD>Soviets Reportedly Delay Withdrawal From Kandahar</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet troops are delaying their pullout from <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s second largest city, Western diplomats said today. <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, population about 200,000, has been under siege for several weeks and Moslem guerrillas are reportedly preparing for another major offensive against Soviet-Afghan troops stationed there. Reports reaching <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> say Afghan insurgents have pushed government troops to defensive positions around the outskirts of the city. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1979 sent troops to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to support the Marxist regime. On May 15, the Soviets began a withdrawal, which has been slowed by attacks from guerrillas. Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a Soviet regiment was told to cancel plans to leave <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, reflecting Soviet fears over the city's vulnerability. Soviet forces reportedly have left <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION>, on the road from <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> to the Afghan capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, but some soldiers remain in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, where the Soviet withdrawal was launched in May. There have been reports of heavy fighting in the northeastern province of <LOCATION> Baghland </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway, stretching 200 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the Soviet border, is becoming increasingly dangerous, sources said. It was closed to civilian traffic for five days ending Sunday to allow departing Soviet troops to move north. Diplomatic sources say the convoys have been attacked by guerrillas and that up to 100 Soviet soldiers were reported killed in recent clashes. The official <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, continues to broadcast a list of guerrilla defeats and atrocities. It claimed Monday that 93 guerrillas were killed and as many injured in recent clashes in seven of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 28 provinces. The various reports can not be independently confirmed.

 Fire broke out early today in two apartments above a used furniture store, killing seven people, including five children ranging in age from 2 to 6, authorities said. Six victims _ one woman and all five children _ were found beneath a boarded-up window, said <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> Fire Chief <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Lickert </PERSON>. In addition, he said, the three-story, wooden-frame building had no fire escapes and a door on the ground-floor that was the exit for the two apartments was locked on the outside. Fire officials said they found one smoke detector that had no batteries. The seventh victim, a man, was found in a second-floor hallway, <PERSON> Lickert </PERSON> said. Three adults were injured, officials said. The fire in the building was reported at 3:48 a.m., said Fire Lt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamper </PERSON>. Officials did n't know what caused the fire or where it started and arson investigators were at the scene this morning. There were three apartments on the second floor, said the building's owner, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackburn </PERSON>. The door to the two apartments was padlocked on the outside, apparently by residents who reached through a window to lock it at night for security, he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Blackburn </PERSON> said she was unaware of the padlock. Two windows in the building were boarded, one to keep pigeons out of the attic, Mrs. <ORGANIZATION> Blackburn </ORGANIZATION> said. There was no indication why the other window, where the victims were found, was boarded. The victims died of apparent smoke inhalation, <PERSON> Coroner </PERSON>'s Investigator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Butler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkhardt </PERSON> identified the victims as <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeseman </PERSON> and her 2-year-old son <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>; <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 30; <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 6; <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 4; and twins <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 2. `` I was very close to them. I used to take them to the store,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Blackburn </PERSON>, who did not live in the building, said of the children. `` That's the only thing I cared about, was those babies.'' She said the <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> girl and the Millers were the children of <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 30, who was listed in serious condition at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamilton-Hughes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. There was no indication how <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was related to the other victims.

<TEXT>
 A judge has ordered a 60-woman bowling league reinstated at a country club that allegedly took away the league's time slot because its members did n't spend enough on food and drinks. But a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Fern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> said it was a matter of a lack of a contract and that there would n't be any lanes to spare for the Wednesday Night Ladies House League when the order takes effect Sept. 7. <LOCATION> Macomb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> issued a preliminary injunction Monday restoring the women's time slot, said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were real pleased,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Blossey </PERSON>, president of the women's league. `` We've said all along we liked bowling at <PERSON> Fern </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and we wanted to stay there.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> entered the case last month after the women complained that <PERSON> Fern </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> management kicked them out because they did n't spend enough money on food and drink. But later, club owner <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Severini </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the women were not invited back for their March league because they had n't signed a contract. `` Drinking has nothing to do with it,'' he said. <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> said it was the first time in four years that <PERSON> Fern </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> had required them to sign a contract. She maintained that none of the other leagues bowling at the country club have contracts. <PERSON> Fern </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyboer </PERSON> said he hopes to overturn the order. `` We're not pleased. We're probably going to end up having a trial this summer; at this point it's just an injunction,'' <PERSON> Heyboer </PERSON> said. `` The place only has 12 lanes and those lanes are gone. `` We've been under contract with the men's league since Feb. 18. There's going to be a lot of bowling balls coming down the alley, I'm afraid.''

 Any Cabinet-level federal official should resign if continuing in office harms the president or the presidency, former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> said in response to a question about Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, in an appearance Monday before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, was asked what advice he would give <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> regarding resignation from office. An independent counsel has been investigating conflict-of-interest allegations regarding <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s financial dealings. `` I strongly believe that when a person in the Cabinet or in some comparable post in the federal government, if he is challenged for alleged misdeeds, if his staying in office in any way undercuts or jeopardizes the president or the presidency, that individual should walk into the Oval Office and offer his resignation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. He did not mention <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by name, nor did he say <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continuation in office undercuts or jeopardizes the president <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said in his speech that the deficit-saddled federal budget process `` is in total shambles'' and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should restore power to the White House to straighten out the mess. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> called for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate the president's power to impound appropriated money, a device <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> removed when it streamlined the budget process in 1974. `` The anti-impoundment provisions, in my opinion, have been a disaster,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. The present system is `` no substitute for strong action by the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s speech came after he unveiled his portrait at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s Hall of the Presidents, the first presidential portrait painted explicitly for the collection.

 A stable owner fatally shot himself with a shotgun after inviting family and friends to a property settlement hearing that would end his 44-year marriage. The courthouse in <LOCATION> Arapahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, has been the scene of several violent family breakups prompting authorities to install metal detectors at the door. Deputies, who had been alerted by the wife's attorney about the invitations, watched from atop the courthouse Monday as the stable owner, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, 63, drove by. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> had sent the notes to people who knew him and his wife, <PERSON> Gracie </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON>, so they could witness `` <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION>'s moment of glory,'' said <LOCATION> Arapahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. Deputies ringed the parking lot and entrance to the courthouse, planning to escort <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> to the courtroom. As they watched him with binoculars he drove to park on a dead-end street; then they lost sight of him. Deputies later found him slumped in his seat, with a shotgun wound in his chest. Many of the couple's relatives had shown up for the scheduled hearing. `` We had our hands full trying to keep them away from each other,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, attorney for Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, said the shooting emphasized that courthouse `` security is essential.'' He said Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who is confined to a wheelchair, `` has been in hiding out of the state for a year and a half.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said he has feared for his life and that of Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. `` He sent threats to both of us through friends, relatives and in letters,'' the attorney said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Stable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> area, was charged with cruelty to animals in 1974, 1979 and 1983 but was acquitted each time. People entering the courthouse have been scanned by metal detectors since January when <PERSON> Chanh </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Duong </PERSON> fatally shot his estranged wife outside a courtroom where they were scheduled for a child custody hearing. Two years earlier, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Utesch </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> police officer at the time, shot his wife's divorce lawyer, crippling her.

 A Bulgarian cosmonaut rocketed into a clear blue sky today along with two Soviets in the first manned space mission of 1988, a launch televised live and featuring broadcasts from inside the capsule. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON>, 36, of the Bulgarian town of <LOCATION> Omurtag </LOCATION>, and the two Soviets blasted off at 6:03 p.m. -LRB- 10:03 a.m. EDT -RRB- aboard a Soyuz TM-5 capsule from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Soviet television gave unusually extensive coverage of the liftoff, showing live pictures of <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON>'s family in <LOCATION> Omurtag </LOCATION> and black-and-white shots of the cosmonauts in the moments before and after launch. `` I feel excellent,'' <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON> said on the live broadcast seconds after the launch. The broadcast, which lasted more than an hour, showed <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON>'s mother and other members of his family watching the launch on television in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s defense minister was among the dignitaries viewing the liftoff at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in the republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. The broadcast showed cheering, waving crowds gathered on Bulgarian streets. Only a few clouds were visible in television shots of Baikonur. Orange flames coming from the Vostok booster rocket contrasted with the blue sky in the background. The mission comes while the American manned space program is grounded. The last launch, in January 1986, ended in disaster. Seven astronauts were killed when the space shuttle Challenger exploded. <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON> and cosmonauts <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Savinykh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> are scheduled to dock Thursday with the Soviet space station Mir. Already aboard Mir are cosmonauts <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON>, who were the last men to enter space. They boarded Mir on Dec. 23, 1987. During a 10-day mission, <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON> and his four Soviet colleagues are to conduct about 40 experiments, some using Bulgarian equipment. The expermiments involve space physics, remote sensing of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, space biology and medicine, the news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> has said. The cosmonauts are taking with them an orchid grown on Earth from seeds originally planted on the Mir station, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The last Bulgarian-Soviet flight, in April 1979, was marred by a failed attempt to dock with the Salyut space station. The Soviets plan several other manned missions this year, including crews from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

 Underground leaders of the 6-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories today called on <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders to open their borders to guerrilla attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The appeal, carried by the Palestinian news agency <ORGANIZATION> Wafa </ORGANIZATION>, was made to the Arab chiefs of state who begin a three-day emergency summit meeting in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> tonight. The summit was to be devoted to solidifying support for the Palestinian uprising among the 21 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> members. The underground leaders of the uprising _ which involves mainly Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> _ said all the Arab nations surrounding <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should `` open their borders to Palestinian combatants.'' The appeal was directed mainly at <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the three nations represented at the summit that have a common border with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. All three, fearing Israeli reprisals, have taken action to prevent guerrilla attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> across their borders. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> prepared a spectacular welcome for <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, who arrived on a luxury liner in the Bay of <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. His visit marks the two North African Arab neighbors' reconciliation after 12 years of hostility. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> resumed diplomatic relations May 16 after deciding to put aside their dispute over the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, at least for now. <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> arrived this afternoon, escorted by female bodyguards and wearing a gold-embroidered white kaftan. A black-and-white Palestinian khafia in the colors of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> was draped around his neck. In a statement distributed by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s official news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> on the eve of the summit, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> accused unidentified <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders of `` acting under specific instructions from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` The possibility of denouncing these leaders before the Palestinian people and the Arab nation will perhaps be the only positive point of this summit,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> declared. President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were among the last to arrive. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> flew in Monday. The underground leaders `` exhorted the Arab chiefs of state to allow Palestinians living in the Arab countries to take part in the struggle against the Zionist enemy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Wafa </ORGANIZATION> said. The uprising's leadership also demanded joint Arab action to give `` international protection'' to the Palestinian people and to demolish all `` suspect peace plans,'' such as that of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Today, he ended a four-day tour of the region to promote the plan. An international peace conference with full representation of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> remains the only way to `` a durable, just and global peace,'' the underground leaders declared. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> officially regard the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist organization and seek to bar it from any role in the peace process. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said Monday in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> that the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan was `` born dead.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was not only demanding money to compensate for loss of income due to protest strikes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, but other forms of support such as food shipments. He said political support for the rioting should include a unified stand by the conferees, rejecting the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative and reiterating `` their endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, inside and outside the occupied terroritories.'' Arab League officials and diplomats said the summit will also touch on other key problems facing the Arab world, such as the Iran-Iraq war and the conflict in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the 20-year-old son of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, says he may run for the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> against a five-term incumbent.

 A space shuttle crew made a mock emergency landing today to conclude a major countdown rehearsal held to test hundreds of launch changes that were made as a result of the Challenger disaster. Following a successful practice countdown and liftoff, the three-man astronaut crew, in a shuttle flight simulator in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, had to make a tricky, quick return to the Kennedy Space Center runway here when one of three main engines failed more than two minutes into the flight. The rehearsal for the nation's first shuttle mission in 2 -LCB- years put the launch team here through the final three hours of the count in a realistic preparation for the actual launch of Discovery, scheduled Aug. 31. It was the most comprehensive test of its kind since Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch, killing the seven crew members, on Jan. 28, 1986. The make-believe emergency landing gave the astronauts and mission control center in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> vital experience in making split-second decisions. To make it safely back to the runway here, the astronauts had to `` fly'' the simulator to an altitude of about 75 miles and about 400 miles east of here while fuel was exhausted. Then, with a second engine locked up and useless, the astronauts pitched around, went through the motions of jettisoning their huge external fuel tank into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and, battling hydraulic and other difficulties, glided to a mock touchdown on the 15,000-foot shuttle runway three miles from the launch pad. Landing occurred 21 minutes after the engine failed. Executing the maneuvers in the simulator were astronauts <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetherbee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON>. Observing were commander <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> and the four members of his crew who will fly the Discovery mission in August. The simulated liftoff was 55 minutes late because of intentional electrical, communications and other problems built into the count to give controllers experience in resolving them. A high fuel pressure reading 31 seconds before liftoff would have scrubbed a real launch effort, but was bypassed so the test could continue. The exercise involved 300 launch-day team members from five <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> field centers, contractor personnel and rescue, weather, safety and communications officials. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said the purpose was to `` validate to the fullest extent possible the complete launch process system.'' There have been hundreds of changes, most aimed at safety, in procedures, personnel, flight and ground hardware, software and management since the Challenger accident. Today's simulation was the only opportunity to check them out with the entire launch-day team before the actual countdown. Under the new management structure, astronaut <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, veteran of four shuttle flights, has the final decision on whether a shuttle will be launched. His main adviser is launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON>, but either can call on scores of experts in many disciplines. The shuttle fleet has been grounded since the Challenger disaster, with the major roadblock to flight being the redesign of the solid fuel booster rocket blamed for the explosion. Discovery is in a hangar here, undergoing final checks following an overhaul of its main engine and other systems. On June 16, it is to be moved into an assembly building for mating with its two booster rockets and external fuel tank. Transfer to the launch pad is planned for June 27. The spaceship's three main engines will be test-fired on the pad in a critical test on July 19. Space agency officials said the Aug. 31 launch target can be met if no critical problems crop up during testing here and at the <LOCATION> Morton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thiokol </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where two more full-scale tests are planned of the redesigned booster rocket. The <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> tests are slated for June 14 and July 26. When Discovery is launched it will carry a crew of five veteran shuttle astronauts who will deploy a tracking and data relay satellite and conduct experiments during four days in space.

In other highlights of voting in seven states, Californians decide a large crop of propositions, including a measure sponsored by supporters of extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> that would permit the state to quarantine AIDS victims. <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> voters could become the first in the nation to close a nuclear power plant, the troubled Rancho Seco; and voters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> _ the nation's largest _ will decide whether to carve away the eastern, desert portion to create a new county called Mojave In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, the nation's seventh-largest city, Mayor <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> is expected to win a four-year term by gaining a majority in the nonpartisan primary. She was first elected two years ago after Mayor <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedgecock </PERSON> was convicted of a felony and forced to resign. Both of the nation's first-term Democrats are among the senators with a stake in today's races, and both have been targeted as vulnerable by the national GOP. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> has two little-known primary opponents, and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has none. New Jersey Republicans have united behind a single nominee, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, a former Heisman trophy winner, <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> scholar and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war hero who moved to the state to enter the race. Voting officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> reported a light turnout this morning for the primary races. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, four Republicans are competing for the chance to face <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>. A poll taken last week for the <ORGANIZATION> Albuquerque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> showed state Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> leading the field with support of 29.5 percent of Republicans, but 38.9 percent were undecided. A third first-term senator seeking re-election is Republican <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He has no primary competition, but does have a jinx to worry about _ for 30 years, no one holding his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat has been elected more than once. On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> is expected to dispatch three little-known opponents. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> also has a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race, with two-term Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON> opposed in the primary by attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON>, who advocates a parliamentary form of government. <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> is the only GOP entrant. But the liveliest race in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> is for governor, since Democrat <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON>'s decision to retire after two terms has left the ballot without an incumbent for the first time in 20 years. The six-way Democratic field features a comeback bid by former Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Judge </PERSON>, who served two terms before losing to <LOCATION> Schwinden </LOCATION> in the primary eight years ago. A <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Poll taken last week showed Judge was the choice of 28 percent of Democratic voters, but 35 percent were undecided. In the two-way Republican race, the poll showed a dead heat between former state Sen. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> and state Rep. <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON>. The GOP favorite, Secretary of State <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Waltermire </PERSON>, was killed in a plane crash in April. The retirement of <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>, whose 79th birthday is today, comes amid growing sentiment that his predominantly black district should be represented by the state's first black congressman. Two black <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> city councilmen, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, are competing in the Democratic primary, with the winner expected to defeat the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, political newcomer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who also is black. Here is a look at the other states voting today: <LOCATION> ALABAMA </LOCATION> _ Democratic Reps. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sylacauga </LOCATION> are favored to turn back primary challenges. Races for three <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seats have turned into unusually rough-and-tumble scraps in which big business and insurance companies are backing one slate of Democrats, while trial lawyers and less conservative interests are backing another. One of the candidates with trial lawyer support is Circuit Judge <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, a son-in-law of former Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>. He is running against <LOCATION> Anniston </LOCATION> lawyer A.W. Bolt, who is supported by business lobbies, for an associate justice post. <LOCATION> IOWA </LOCATION> _ Sixteen <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> supporters are running in Democratic primaries, five for congressional nominations and the rest in state legislative districts. Four Democrats are seeking the nomination to oppose first-term GOP Rep. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, who for years played <PERSON> Gopher </PERSON> on television's `` The Love Boat.'' <LOCATION> SOUTH </LOCATION> <LOCATION> DAKOTA </LOCATION> _ The state is having one of its quietest elections in memory, with no statewide races on the ballot. And there are only 26 primary races for the 105 state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats. The state's lone congressman, Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, is unopposed in the primary as is his Republican challenger, state Treasurer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Volk </PERSON>.

 A Latin American effort to negotiate a settlement to the political crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> got off to an unpromising start last week when military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> showed no inclination to surrender power, according a senior administration official. The official, insisting on anonymity, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> showed `` an unwillngness to compromise and no give'' in his meeting with former presidents <PERSON> Caros </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. The meeting was held a week after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiating effort collapsed when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> unexpectedly rejected a package deal at the last minute that would have required him to resign his post as <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> commander in August and temporarily leave the country. In an interview Monday, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who is seeking another term as <LOCATION> Venezuelan </LOCATION> president in elections in December, is expected to report on his <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> initiative to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> later this month. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> refused comment on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s meeting with the two presidents. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked today if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> planned to lift its economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said, `` There has been no change in our policy. We are proceeding on the same course and do n't anticipate any change at this point.'' Meanwhile, two <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoys were dispatched to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last week to assess the situation, but no meetings were held with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> or other government officials. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, explored the possibility of new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> options for dealing with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the wake of the failed negotiating effort. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a deputy assistant secretary who accompanied <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON>, examined the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and concluded that `` the economic pressures on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are very great,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. Among other measures, the administration has frozen Panamanian assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is withholding payments to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for services related to the operation of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. A separate Latin American initiative on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> involves an offer by Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> for his country to be used as a site for negotiations between <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his political opponents. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> appeared to hold out little hope that any Latin American negotiation could reach a settlement that would meet the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal of restoring democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> noted that the deal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators had worked out was opposed by an overwhelming majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The objections were based largely on the administration offer to drop federal drug smuggling indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as part of the package deal. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> expressed doubt that the Latin negotiators would be able get a better deal than the one <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> rejected because they lack leverage. `` The Latins do n't have as much clout as we do because they ca n't play with the indictments or the sanctions,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said `` How are they going to get a better deal? If they get a worse deal, how is that going to be acceptable to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people? `` So the Latin role is both promising and potentially quite difficult.''

 While environmentalists waited for a judge to consider their request to stop the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> from generating intense electromagnetic pulses off the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced today that the tests had begun. The tests, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, are intended to measure the ability of naval equipment to withstand radiation following a nuclear blast. The Pentagon said the Empress II barge had reached the test site off the <LOCATION> Virginia-North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast Monday afternoon and began the monthlong experiment by transmitting three micro-second bursts of electrical energy at around 4 p.m. `` At about 8 a.m. this morning the generator began the second day of tests,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The tests, she said, were being monitored by sophisticated measuring devices onshore, 15 miles away. `` The effect of the transmissions at those sites would be the same as sitting inside a car and transmitting on a <ORGANIZATION> CB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> for one second,'' she said. The Foundation on Economic Trends, a Washington-based environmental group, asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to halt the project. `` Right now our attorneys are at the courthouse trying to get the judge to set a time for a hearing on our request for an injunction while we appeal the last court ruling,'' said <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, director of the foundation. The barge Empress II is designed to simulate the electromagnetic radiation that would follow the detonation of a nuclear weapon outside the Earth's atmosphere. The tests are intended to determine the ability of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships, aircraft and weapons to withstand the pulses. Empress II, or Electromagnetic Pulse Radiation Environment Simulator for Ships, Second Generation, can generate pulses of up to 7 million volts. Environmentalists have expressed concern the surges will disrupt the marine environment within the test area, and might affect computers and other delicate equipment outside it. `` We just do not believe the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has taken a hard look at these possible consequences at this particular site,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimbrell </PERSON>, an attorney for the foundation. The foundation filed a lawsuit in 1987 and reached agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> last month that an environmental impact statement was needed before testing could begin. The foundation's interpretation of the agreement was that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would submit an environmental impact statement on the site it chose for testing, which could take up to two years. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s interpretation was that it would submit an impact statement, but that the study would not necessarily involve a specific site. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> submitted a statement previously drawn up for a <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> site. A federal judge ruled Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s interpretation was plausible, and allowed the tests to proceed. Several calls today to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> seeking to find out the time for the tests were not returned. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> insists that no dangers to the environment have been found in 20 years of similar testing and exhaustive studies.

 Australian adventurer <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Dundee </PERSON> left his competitors down under as `` ` Crocodile' Dundee II'' bit off 50 percent more of the weekend box-office gross than its nearest rival, the <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> comedy `` Big.'' <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s blood-and-blast-filled `` Rambo III'' slipped to third place, while the <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> comedy `` Funny Farm'' cultivated enough money to harvest the No. 4 spot, plowing the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas-produced </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> Howard-directed fantasy `` Willow'' into fifth place. `` ` Crocodile' Dundee II,'' the comedy sequel starring <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, hunted up $ 12.72 million, compared with $ 8.22 million for `` Big,'' in which <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> portrays a boy who gets his wish to become a grownup `` Rambo III,'' in which <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rambo </PERSON> shoots, bombs, stabs and otherwise maims numerous Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, ranked third, grossing $ 7.69 million for the weekend. Chase's portrayal of a sportswriter seeking country-style relaxation in `` Funny Farm'' reaped nearly $ 5.66 million. The medieval fatnasy `` Willow,'' which cost $ 35 million to produce plus $ 20 million to make prints and for advertising, drooped two place to fifth, grossing just over $ 5 million for the weekend. `` That's not bad,'' insisted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krier </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which compiles the box office takes. `` It shows possibilities of holding well.'' After the top five films, weekend grosses dropped sharply. `` Colors,'' the <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn-Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>, cops-versus-street gangs drama, brought in $ 1.45 million, while <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>'s ghostly comedy `` Beetlejuice,'' scared up $ 1.42 million. `` Friday the 13th Part VII'' slashed another $ 900,156 out of filmgoers' wallets.

 The son of retiring Rep. <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> has conceded defeat in a close Republican primary race for the congressional seat the elder <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> has held since 1958. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> said in an interview Monday that he will not pursue his right to have the validity of a number of ballots from the May 3 primary decided by the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, leaving state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee by just 27 votes. `` This decision will mean that the Republican nominee for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from the 5th District will have been nominated by a margin of 27 votes, the narrowest margin ever recorded in an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> congressional race. Notwithstanding the narrow margin, I congratulate the winner,'' said <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, 32, a Bowling Green attorney. An official recount of the May 3 primary ballots in the 13-county northwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> district gave <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON> 28,694 votes to 28,667 for <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>. A third candidate, <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Damschroder </PERSON> of Fremont, received 5,769 votes. The closest election suffered by the elder <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget and rules committees, was 55 percent in 1982. He rebounded to 63 percent in 1984 and did as well in 1986. The congressman's son said Friday there was some concern over several disputed ballots. On Monday, he declined to disclose how many ballots were in question. But one Republican official, who spoke on the condition his name not be used, said there were fewer than 27 disputed ballots and suggested that might have been a factor in <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>'s decision against a legal challenge. <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON>, 49, of <PERSON> Port </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, said Monday he was glad the primary was finally over. `` This has been the longest election night I have ever been in. It was an election night that lasted 30 days,'' he joked.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is pressing reluctant <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> officials to permit extradition of a Palestinian suspected of involvement in the bombings of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet in 1982 and of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner in 1986, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. Greek officials told the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> they did not think the evidence against <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> was sufficient and asked for additional information to justify extradition proceedings, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Monday, speaking only on condition of anonymity. He said <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> at the request of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> today, government spokesman <PERSON> Telemachos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitiris </PERSON> refused to comment directly, saying only: `` <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> always cooperates for the eradication of terrorism and is dedicated to the struggle against it. It imposes the strictest possible penalties against terrorists according to Greek law.'' A report about <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>'s arrest and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> annoyance over <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s hesitancy to extradite him appeared Monday in <LOCATION> Eleftherotypia </LOCATION>, a left-wing Greek daily newspaper The paper said <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> was seized Thursday at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> airport on a tip from an official in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy. `` A police source said yesterday -LRB- Sunday -RRB- that there are no charges against <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, except maybe the use of a forged passport,'' <PERSON> Eleftherotypia </PERSON> wrote. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence information on <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> indicates he was involved in a 1986 blast aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> airliner over <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, in which four people, including a baby, were killed, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> also is suspected of playing a role in planting the bomb that exploded as a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet was heading toward <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> in August 1982 on a flight from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. A Japanese teen-ager was killed and 15 people were injured, none seriously. A second source told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greece </ORGANIZATION> has not yet made a decision on the extradition request. The first official said Ambassador <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top anti-terrorism official, flew to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> last week to press the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> government to permit the extradition of <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, also asked for <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>'s extradition during a meeting last Thursday with Greek Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, said a third source, also speaking on condition of anonymity. The extradition request comes at a sensitive time in U.S.-Greek relations. The two countries are negotiating the extension of the leases on four American bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Hospital Chief: County President Knew About Experiments In January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drug experiments on more than 200 pregnant women were known to the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, but he did not tell other commissioners, according to the director of the county hospital. Two doctors gave Dilantin, a drug commonly used to treat epilepsy, to about 245 pregnant women to determine whether the drug reduced fetal stress during Caesarean-section births, hospital Director <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. But only five of the women had consented to participate in the hospital-approved study that began in September 1987, he said. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> and other hospital officials met with the board, which acts as trustees for the hospital, behind closed doors for nearly two hours Monday to discuss the case against the two anesthesiologists. Several board members said they were angry and shocked when they heard the disclosure. The board's president, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>, said he did n't recall being told. He said the board would take no immediate action and would wait for the hospital medical staff's executive committee to finish its investigation, a process required under medical staff bylaws. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> was told about the experiments in January when hospital medical director Dr. <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Lattimer </PERSON> ordered a halt to the study. `` We told President <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> and he advised us to follow due process according to the hospital's bylaws,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> said, `` I do n't recall that conversation.'' Commissioner <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which oversees <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Cermak </PERSON> hospitals, said, `` Doctors should know that you do n't conduct experiments on patients without getting their consent.'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said the doctors' study called for giving the drug to no more than 50 pregnant patients who were candidates for Caesarean-section deliveries. `` The great majority'' of the 245 patients given the drug were pregnant, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said, adding that he knew `` at least one patient'' who was not. He said he was not sure why non-pregnant women would have been given Dilantin. Several past studies have reported higher incidences of birth defects, including heart abnormalities and retardation, in babies born to women who regularly used Dilantin and other drugs used to combat epileptic seizures. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> has noted, however, that the women at <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> were given a single dose of between 500 and 700 milligrams _ `` substantially lower'' than a normal dose _ at or near the time they delivered. Ms. <PERSON> Lattimer </PERSON> said she was convinced the pregnant women who had been given the drug without their consent suffered `` no adverse effects.'' `` That does not mean it is not a serious infraction and should not be prevented from happening again,'' she said. `` The physicians involved in this study violated hospital regulations.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have initiated direct contacts with the Iranians in an effort to free foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> reported today. In a front-page story, the conservative daily quoted <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> and Sunni Moslem sources in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opened talks with Iranian officials almost two months ago in the hope of finding a `` legal'' formula to secure the release of the American hostages. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he was not aware of any such contacts and said he had not seen the Times story. `` As you know, we're always talking to people at various levels about the hostage situation,'' he said. `` These stories come up frequently and usually are n't correct, and I do n't think this one is either.'' Asked if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be bothered by having his term end without the liberation of the American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Well, he'll be very disappointed, of course. The hostage situation has been one of enormous concern and frustration to the president.'' Times correspondent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, writing from west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said separate contacts by the three countries with the Iranians are all reported to have taken place in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` So widely are the reports now believed in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> here has been approached by several organizations representing kidnapped Lebanese in the hope that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> might include other hostages in its bargaining with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said. Eighteen foreigners are missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> including nine Americans, three Britons and one West German. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> who was kidnapped March 16, 1985, is the longest-held hostage. The Shiite and Sunni sources were quoted as saying that `` legal'' methods of freeing the hostages would involve the paying of compensation to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the release of Iranian assets which were frozen after the 1979 revolution that overthrew <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has repeatedly demanded that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deliver large quantities of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> weapons and armor paid for by the shah, the paper said. `` What has emerged only too clearly in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> is that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> controls all the foreign hostages still alive here and that even incidents like the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> hijacking ultimately have their roots in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said. `` This is why the increasing reports here of contacts between <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> are met with so little incredulity,'' he said. <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> reported new details on several hostage-takings. For example, he said, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, the Archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>'s special envoy, is now believed to have been detained in January 1987 by relatives of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who was arrested in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> four days earlier and is a suspect in the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jet <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to meet with the kidnappers of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and another American. <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> quoted sources close to the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia as saying Lt.

<HEAD>Chinese Premiere of `Last Emperor' Delayed Two Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Chinese premiere of the Academy Award-winning movie `` The Last Emperor,'' which was to have opened this month, will be delayed until August, an official said Tuesday. The spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, which must approve all foreign films shown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>'s epic was still being dubbed into Chinese Reports in April said the film would open in a matter of weeks. There has been speculation that the Chinese release of the film, which captured nine Oscars, including best picture and best director, had run into conservative opposition and would be censored by Chinese officials. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied that. The movie was cut by censors in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Criticisms of `` The Last Emperor'' have appeared in the official press, including charges that it had `` taken too many liberties with historical facts and leaned too much toward vulgarity in order to please moviegoers.'' The movie depicts the life of the last Chinese ruler, <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>, from child emperor, to puppet ruler under the Japanese, to prisoner of the Communists and finally a gardener in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. During the annual session of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature in April, delegates charged that favoritism was shown toward the foreign movie crew, which was allowed to shoot interior scenes in the Imperial Palace in violation of Chinese law.

 The widow of the late president, <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, claims the government has taken away her rights and security since her husband's death eight years ago, a newspaper said Tuesday. <PERSON> Jovanka </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> was involved in a dispute with the government over her inheritance and has lived in virtual seclusion since Tito, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s leader for 35 years, died on May 4, 1980. The state-run <LOCATION> Danas </LOCATION> weekly quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> as saying that she was evicted from <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>'s palatial residence in an exclusive <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> suburb on June 30, 1980, and was allowed to take along only the most essential personal effects. `` <PERSON> Jovanka </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> claims that, eight years after <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>'s death, she lives deprived of her ... existential security and elementary human rights,'' the report said. One night, she was removed from the residence she shared with <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> and was taken out through a side door, taking only three little dogs with her, the report said. Mrs. <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> filed suit in 1985 to gain some of <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>'s estate, mostly paintings, furs, jewelry and furniture. The government quashed the move in December 1986 by ruling the goods were state property. The government has built a new house for her in the vicinity of her former residence, but Mrs. <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> has refused to move in until the authorities settle her financial status and inheritance.

 Fierce fighting broke out at a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> university Tuesday when masked students attacked riot police with rocks and firebombs and shouted anti-government and anti-U.S. slogans. Student leaders at other universities organized peaceful rallies and vowed to march to the border with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in an attempt to force reunification of the North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. `` Down with the military dictatorship!'' and `` Yankee go home!'' students at <ORGANIZATION> Soongshil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> yelled as they dashed out to hurl firebombs that exploded in flames around police in front of the school. The violence erupted during mourning for a student from the university who died Monday after setting himself afire during an anti-government protest. Police fired hundreds of rounds of tear gas but were forced back several times by groups of protesters who barricaded a road with two basketball backboards and wielded clubs under cover of firebombs and rocks flying from the rooftop of a school building. The fighting involved about 1,000 students and continued for several hours, often carrying into nearby alleys, as students chased squadrons of police huddling behind shields. Both students and policemen were seen being hit by rocks and other missiles, but police had no overall injury figures. The front of the campus was draped in black mourning banners as students inside the school stood watch over the coffin of Park Rae-chun. Park was the third student to commit suicide in a month. Violent clashes erupted at several provincial campuses, but students held peaceful rallies at many other schools across the country to prepare for a planned march Friday to the border truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>. Despite repeated government warnings, radical student leaders vow to go ahead with their march to the border to force unification of the peninsula, divided in 1945 into Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and pro-Western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` Drive out <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> who forced the partition of our land!'' a speaker shouted at a campus rally. Police vowed to arrest all students marching to the heavily militarized border. Opposition parties also opposed the march, urging students to leave contacts with the North to official channels. The protesters contend that the presence of 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> _ based here under a mutual defense pact _ hinders reunification of the two Koreas. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops would stay in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> `` as long as the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people want us to stay.'' `` The threat from the North has not abated, and the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> continue to modernize their armed forces and deploy them forward in a threatening manner,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said after arriving in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and many other American officers are here for annual U.S.-South Korean security consultations, which will include <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security help to ensure a successful Olympics. The Games begin Sept. 19 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>White House AIDS Commission Takes Up Watkins Recommendations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House AIDS commission opened debate today on its chairman's 579 proposed recommendations, amid indications there will be a lot of talk but little real controversy over most of them. `` There is no controversy in the first 11 chapters,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> told fellow commissioners. Those chapters contain all of the recommendations _ except those calling for granting the surgeon general sweeping powers to deal with the epidemic. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> made clear to the panel chairman, retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, that he does not agree with his recommendations for essentially turning the AIDS fight over to Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he was determined that the commission make some recommendation to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the best way to structure the federal health bureaucracy to deal with AIDS. `` It is not well done today,'' said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. Government bureaucracies usually work, except when they have to move quickly in emergencies, said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>. And AIDS, he said, is a national health emergency. While saying he was not necessarily determined to stick to his recommendation that the surgeon general head the fight, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the commission has a responsibility to reach a consensus because `` we're in the best position to do it.'' A cornerstone of the recommendations <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> made last Thursday was a call for federal legislation to protect from discrimination people who have the AIDS virus. Although somewhat controversial because it runs counter to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's stated position, there was clear consensus on the commission to retain that in the final report due at the White House June 24. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> expressed slight reservation about whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be getting into that area, but made clear that he favors some kind of anti-discrimination protection. `` If we're going to make it, we should expand it to cover not just AIDS, but all diseases,'' he said. After brief opening remarks, the commission began a page-by-page discussion of the 269-page report. It plans at least two more days of meetings next Thursday and Friday to vote on the final version, running into the weekend if necessary to complete deliberations.

<HEAD>Votes Switch Or Trade Bill Is Doomed, Senate Leaders Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Congressional efforts to make the omnibus trade bill law over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto are doomed unless sponsors can switch a handful of votes before Wednesday's showdown on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, leaders said Tuesday. `` I hope enough senators will change their minds tomorrow ... and override the president's veto,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said he could not change the votes and could only hope that last-minute home-state pressure would cause three senators to relent and provide the two-thirds margin needed to override <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the 1,000-page bill, designed to strengthen the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position in the international marketplace. Centerpiece provisions would overhaul the system under which the government imposes import curbs as a means of aiding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries and punishing international trade violations by other countries. A wide array of other provisions range from hefty agricultural subsidies to repeal of the 1980 windfall profits tax on oil-industry earnings. The president vetoed the bill May 24, focusing heavily on opposition to a provision that would require companies with 100 employees or more to provide notice to their workers of impending plant closings and large-scale layoffs. In short order, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 308-113 to override the veto and approve the bill. But supporters of the measure have found the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> tougher going. `` We're winning,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., a critic of the measure, told reporters `` We've got 36'' votes. Even if one senator, Democrat <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, were not at home recuperating from surgery, opponents would be able to put an override out of reach if they could muster 34 votes in the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The administration has said it wants a more moderate version of the trade bill once the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sustains the veto. There has been cloakroom talk that some senators looking at their re-election campaigns feel more comfortable about supporting the veto if they are assured that there will be another chance to vote on the trade issue before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns in October. But it remains uncertain whether there will be such a second bill. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> has repeatedly raised the possibility that a raft of potential amendments that already have been taken care of over the last three years would reappear and stall the measure amid lengthy debate. `` There will have to be some agreement between the ledership and the committee to hold off amendments,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. He said there was scant precedent for such a procedure. Failure to approve a trade bill `` would be an issue'' in fall campaigns, `` but I do n't think an overriding issue,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` made a serious mistake on this veto'' because in disregarding the appeal of the plant-closings provision, `` the president has written off an issue that involves decency and right.'' `` The president was poorly advised on it,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, on the verge of claiming the majority he needs to wrap up the Democratic presidential nomination, said today he and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` talked in general terms'' about a future role for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. As voters went to the polls in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and three other final primary states, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> talked positively about the primary season and the months to come. He said he discussed a role for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration when the two met late last night and early this morning. `` We talked in general terms about that,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said they did not discuss the vice presidential spot. `` Tomorrow's another day and I'll be thinking about running mates providing today is a good day,'' he told reporters. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was also poised to finally gain the endorsement of banished rivals Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on Wednesday. His wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, said she was confident the final primaries would put her husband over the top in his march toward the 2,081 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. `` I think <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> will do well and I'm hoping by the eighth of June that he will have sewn up the convention,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from her hospital bed in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Going into today's final round, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held 1,900 of the 2,081 delegates needed to win the nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, campaigning at a high school in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> around <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said he hoped to clinch that magic number of delegates tonight. The campaign was clearly confident he would secure what was needed from the more than 450 delegates up for grabs on Tuesday, most of them in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the remainder in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign would like to declare it has gone over the top in the delegate race tonight or Wednesday morning, before the candidate flies back to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, who is recuperating from spinal surgery at a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> hospital, said she planned to watch the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> returns from her hospital bed. `` I'm excited about tomorrow,'' she said. Spokesman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bander </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could be discharged within a week. A <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would stop in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> on his way home Wednesday and pick up an endorsement from former rival Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. The official also said <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who has suspended his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign, would endorse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Throughout his last day of primary campaigning, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> looked back on his long quest for his party's nomination _ one that began publicly with a trip in early February 1987 to <LOCATION> Osceola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a small town in the state where the first caucuses were held a year later. `` It's by no means the end tomorrow,'' he told a lunchtime crowd at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> plaza. `` It's the beginning, the beginning of a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory in the fall.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> jabbed briefly at his likely Republican opponent for the fall, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, over the issue of drilling for oil off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast, and spoke of Democratic unity when asked about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` If the tables were reversed, and he was on his way to the nomination and I was the runner up, I'd expect to be deeply involved ... I'd try to bring my people into this. I'd be as much service to the ticket as I possibly could,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I'm confident he will be that kind of person,'' he added. `` We'll be reaching out to supporters of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, and the other Democratic candidates, as we have already,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The response has been terrific. I'm really overwhelmed by the good feeling, the spirit, the confidence. A sense of victory is in the air.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides sought to minimize the impact of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s remarks the same day, in which he suggested he would go to the Democratic National Convention floor to fight over the platform on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not alter his position to meet <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has pressed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to say he was willing to brand <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> issues director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said, `` There is a broad basis for agreement here. `` Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> share the same fundamental commitment on issues relating to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` They both want to see an end to apartheid and to take strong and effective steps both by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and by the international community.''

 Thousands of high school students will celebrate graduation until the sun comes up at a $ 35,000 party Saturday, provided they get their parents' OK and promise to abstain from drugs and alcohol. `` If the alcohol industry is not above bribing them into thinking they can only have a good time if they're drinking, I'm not above bribing them into letting them know they can have a good time without drinking,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, statewide coordinator for `` Project Graduation.'' Saturday night's party is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, with support from Students Against Drunk Driving, <ORGANIZATION> Mothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Driving </ORGANIZATION> and some businesses. Teen-agers and local officials held similar affairs at a theme park outside <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> last weekend. Statewide, at least 10 communities are involved in `` Project Graduation,'' officials say. <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s party, for up to 3,000 students, is scheduled from 8 p.m to 5 a.m. and features three bands, food, a 14-foot-wide television screen, video games, and a casino. There are prizes of a new car and trips to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and across the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as well as stereo systems and color televisions. `` They -LRB- the students -RRB- pledge to stay for the entire time, and not to use alcohol or drugs,'' said <PERSON> JoAnne </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a teacher and counselor at <ORGANIZATION> Broughton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. `` Without both forms they do n't receive an invitation, and without an invitation, they do n't get in.'' The hours, she said, are based on drunken driving statistics. `` More deaths among people 16 to 20 years old occur in the months of May and June between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,'' she said. `` Most of these are kids coming back from graduation parties or high school proms.'' Organizers have 300 volunteer chaperones, and 40 off-duty police officers will handle security.

 Attorneys for the former president of <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, who was convicted of distributing phony apple juice, want their client to speak to students about his mistakes as an alternative to prison. <PERSON> Niels </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> was found guilty Feb. 17 of 351 counts of violating the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Each count carries a possible three-year prison term and a $ 10,000 fine. <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> and a co-defendant, former Beech-Nut Vice President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>, are to be sentenced Friday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> was found guilty of 429 counts of violating the same act, along with 18 counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy. <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON>'s attorneys, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, said in a presentencing memorandum that the impact of ethics lessons on business students `` would be far clearer coming from <PERSON> Niels </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON>, whose career has been shattered because he did not heed it, than it could ever be coming from a textbook or a professor.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>, the executive assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney who was the lead prosecutor in the case, said the government's sentencing recommendations would be made public at the hearing.

According to the government, the product contained little or no apple juice. <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s mother will seek asylum in a black church rather than submit to arrest for her refusal to testify before a grand jury investigating her daughter's disappearance, her attorneys said today. `` <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> will not be appearing before a <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury tomorrow,'' her attorney, <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, told reporters. `` <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> will be seeking relief before a higher authority, she will be putting her life in God's hands.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was sentenced to 30 days in jail Monday for defying a grand jury subpoena to testify in the case, but state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> urged authorities to give her one more chance to explain her refusal to cooperate to a judge on Wednesday. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s family has claimed investigators and state officials are engaged in a racially motivated cover-up. Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, 33, was not in the <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courtroom when state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingrassia </PERSON> sentenced her to jail and fined her $ 250. <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> was flanked by attorney <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> as he spoke to reporters on the steps of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, where they attended a hearing in connection with demonstrations they led in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last winter. The three men refused to say what church would offer Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> asylum. But they insisted that the government does not have the right to violate the sanctuary of a church to arrest her for contempt of a grand jury. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said Monday that unless the family of <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> starts cooperating soon, `` we'll have to start winding down the investigation.'' The grand jury will hold its next session Wednesday. <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, 16, was found Nov. 28 lying in a plastic bag in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, about 10 miles north of here and 95 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Her hair was cut, animal excrement was smeared on her and racial epithets were scrawled on her body. She said she had been attacked by six white men, including one who flashed a police-like badge. In one of several testy exchanges Monday with Judge <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingrassia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said the hearing was a `` futile exercise'' and that Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> would not get justice in a system that has been opressing blacks for hundreds of years. <PERSON> Ingrassia </PERSON> said that since the only reasons for the refusal to testify were political, he had no choice but to hold her in contempt. About an hour before the judge's order, Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> left the courthouse with the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, a family adviser, and <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>. She did not appear in the courtroom. Following the proceedings, <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and roughly 300 supporters who came by bus from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> marched down a street. They were surrounded by a dozen bodyguards with linked arms and did not respond to reporters' questions. During the hearing, <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> attorneys twice asked <PERSON> Ingrassia </PERSON> to disqualify himself, saying he had a connection to Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and that he had not taken a leadership role in preventing news leaks about the investigation. <PERSON> Ingrassia </PERSON> said he never met <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, and refused to disqualify himself. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> attorneys had sought to subpoena several officials, including <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Ingrassia </PERSON> rejected the requests.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, poised to lock up his party's presidential nomination, said he would start considering running mates on Wednesday _ `` providing today is a good day'' in the final four primaries The night before, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> exulted that `` victory is in the air,'' while remaining rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> looked back with pride, calling his historic candidacy a `` catalyst for growth.'' Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination in the bag, expressed eagerness to face <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the fall. He said the two have many differences and `` I am ... on the right side.'' Today, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to deflect an issue he is sure to face throughout the campaign _ his involvement or non-involvement in the Iran-Contra affair _ by questioning whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms were sent to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in exchange for hostages' freedom after all `` I'm not sure they were released for anything to do with arms for hostages.'' he said. Pressed as to why three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were released from captivity in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Totally because of that, no. ... There was some inclination on the part of the hostage-holders that they thought they might get something in return. ... It's not all that clear.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today there may well be `` a floor fight or two'' with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his supporters at the Democratic National Convention next month, but he added, `` I do n't see any great divisions within our party.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` must go far beyond our current sanctions'' against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But he stopped short of calling <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist nation, a label demanded of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the party by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> talked in general terms of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s post-primary role in the party during a meeting late Monday night, but he would not give details He said the vice presidency was not discussed. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today the two had discussed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and other issues such as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s complaints about delegate selection. `` He's sensitive on these matters and we're going to have some follow-up meetings, necessarily to discuss matters of platform, credentials, rules, the convention itself, and beyond that our strategy for winning in November,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters. The four-month presidential primary season closed today with races in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. All three presidential contenders were in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> today, and all were staying in the state tonight to wait out the results of the day's contests Early turnout was reported light in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and moderate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The biggest prize is <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> tracking poll indicated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the state by a 2-1 margin, 61 percent to 30 percent. The survey, based on 415 interviews Saturday and Sunday, had a margin of error of 6 percentage points, the network reported Monday night. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials were predicting a low turnout, however. Secretary of State March <PERSON> Fong </PERSON> <PERSON> Eu </PERSON> said she expected a turnout of 48 percent, which would be the lowest in more than 40 years. Before today's voting began, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had nearly 1,900 delegates, leaving him fewer than 200 shy of the 2,081 needed to nominate. On Monday alone, more than 70 delegates flocked to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> trails with less than 1,000 delegates. There were 466 delegates at stake in today's primaries. In addition, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' former rivals for the nomination were lining up behind him. Campaign sources said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would travel to <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the day after the last primaries, to pick up Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s endorsement. The same day, the sources said, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was to endorse the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, not noted for his effusiveness, nonetheless sounded like a happy man as he headed into the final contests. `` I'm really overwhelmed by the good feeling, the spirit, the confidence. A sense of victory is in the air,'' he said as he campaigned Monday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, however, suffered a primary-eve embarrassment when he missed the first 16 minutes of a live half-hour statewide broadcast that was supposed to showcase his campaign and provide a platform for a dramatic final appeal. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published today that he had `` earned the option'' to be offered the vice presidential spot. He had said previously he deserved consideration for the post. In recent weeks, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been looking ahead to the convention and pressing his platform demands. But he has also been looking back at the most successful presidential campaign ever waged by a black candidate. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his candidacy has helped build racial tolerance. `` It's clear <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has become more and more accustomed to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as a possible next president,'' he said Monday. `` It's a matter of growth. I'm the stimulus. I'm the catalyst for that growth.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, got a primary-eve boost of sorts from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> announced Monday night that he was suspending plans for a controversial oil-drilling project off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. Earlier this week, in what was then a step away from the administration, the vice president called for a delay in the project. The two Democrats oppose it outright, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had faulted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for failing to do likewise. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking to a Republican audience on Monday, said he `` ca n't wait for this primary season to end'' so he can go head-to-head with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the primary season has been over for some time. He clinched the 1,139 delegates he needed for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination back in April. But the Republican competition effectively ended three months ago, when the vice president racked up landslide wins across the South.

 Justice Minister <PERSON> Anna-Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> resigned Tuesday over a secret investigation she authorized in the <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> murder case, averting a confidence vote that threatened to bring down the government. Mrs. <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON>, 49, was the highest-ranking woman in Swedish politics and a ranking figure in the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Critics accused her of overstepping her authority by approving the secret probe of Prime Minister Palme's assassination, which has stumped police. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was shot to death on a downtown street the night of Feb. 28, 1986, while walking home from a movie with his wife. The killer has not been found and no motive has been established. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> has offered a reward of 50 million kronor -LRB- $ 8.4 million -RRB- for information leading to the killer. The resignation forestalled a no-confidence motion in Parliament that <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>, Palme's successor, appeared certain to lose. It was an embarrassing setback for the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who lead a minority government, three months before general elections. `` A majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Riksdag </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- parliament -RRB- has decided that I should resign, and that leaves me no option,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> told a news conference. She authorized a friend to look into allegations that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> ordered the killing because <ORGANIZATION> Palme </ORGANIZATION> had stopped illegal Swedish arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Bypassing official investigators, she arranged for publisher <PERSON> Ebbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> to reopen the probe of the alleged Iranian connection. He is not related to the current prime minister. No results of his efforts have been disclosed. Press reports say his investigation began in April. A letter written by Mrs. <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON>, for <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> to carry to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, was dated in May. Police had spent a year looking into the alleged Iranian connection and the possibility that Kurdish exiles were involved. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>, a close friend of the publisher, was fired as police commissioner when he refused to give up on the theory. The outcry about the unofficial project increased after disclosures of irregularities _ including that the publisher's bodyguard smuggled forbidden eavesdropping equipment into <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> The secret operation was financed by a contribution of 2 million kronor -LRB- $ 343,000 -RRB- from a banker. Prime Minister <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> said he will give Mrs. <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> a prominent post in the next Cabinet if his party wins the September elections. `` She's been a great minister, one of the best, but she has made one mistake and the opposition could not overlook that,'' he said. `` She is resigning today from the government but she has a lot left to do in politics.'' He appointed Industry Minister <PERSON> Thage </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> to act as justice minister until the election. Mrs. <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> was forced to quit when the small <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which normally supports <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>'s minority government, decided Monday it would join the opposition in a no-confidence vote. Center Party leader <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Johannson </PERSON> said: `` She has n't followed the rules of the game in our democracy. That's why she had to go. It's clear that she broke the code of procedure and went beyond the constitution.'' She was the third justice minister to resign under a cloud since the Social Democrats took office in 1982. <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickbom </PERSON> quit in October after a convicted spy escaped while on an unguarded conjugal furlough from prison. In 1983, <PERSON> Ove </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> resigned for allegedly taking advantage of tax loopholes. Mrs. <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> was the first justice minister who was not a lawyer by training, and the first woman to hold the job. She favored tougher punishments for criminals and took a strong stand against terrorism.

 Religious dissidents demanded Tuesday that Russian Orthodox Church leaders renounce the church's adulation of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who brutally repressed believers during his rule. `` It's the responsibility of the church to announce which side it is on _ the side of perestroika or the side of Stalinism,'' Father <PERSON> Gleb </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> told reporters in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment. `` A person can not be renewed in his personal life unless he repents. This is true of the church, too,'' he said. <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> and other religious activists met with reporters on the second day of the Russian Orthodox Church local council in <LOCATION> Zagorsk </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, The council is at the center of celebrations of the faith's 1,000 th anniversary Soviet society is reevaluating <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s role in history, and Soviets from <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on down have sharply criticized the purges in which millions of people were killed or exiled. The church has kept silent, and dissidents demanded that the hierarchy join in the criticism of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Almost 100 believers from around the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> crowded in a few small rooms in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment for the beginning of an unofficial three-day seminar on religious problems in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> and other church activists released copies of an appeal they sent to Patriarch <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON>, the Russian Orthodox Church leader, asking that the church council condemn a 1949 letter the council sent to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> for his 70th birthday, `` basically canonizing'' the dictator. The church wrote <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> that it was `` forever grateful to you for your attentiveness to its needs.'' <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> several months ago called on the ailing 77-year-old <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> to resign to allow a younger, more energetic church leader to take advantage of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> was barred from performing religious rites from 1966 until last year because of his criticism of church officials, and he is a former political prisoner. In August, the church gave him a small parish near <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Thousands of priests were exiled or killed during repression following the Bolshevik revolution in 1917. After <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> took power, a law was passed in 1929 sharply restricting church activities. The church faced its severest repression in the 1930s. The dissidents criticized the selection of delegates for the church council in <LOCATION> Zagorsk </LOCATION> and the amount of money being spent on the millennium celebration. Ceremonies scheduled at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Bolshoi Theater threaten to turn the event in a `` pompous, theatrical action,'' <PERSON> Yakunin </PERSON> said. Each day of the weeklong celebration costs about $ 1.6 million, he said. Another dissident priest, <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelshtein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kostroma </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said representatives to the council were chosen by bishops rather than by meetings of lay people, priests and deacons. Dissidents said priests and believers were kept in the dark about the selection of nine candidates for sainthood. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> source said <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Agostino </PERSON> <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON>, who arrives Wednesday as Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s representative at millennium celebrations, will carry a letter from the Polish-born pontiff to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> There was no information on whether <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s message to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would touch on the situation of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which is not officially recognized but operates underground in the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. The Russian Orthodox Church is opposed to official recognition of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. A top church official said Saturday that recognition of it would hurt improving relations between <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and the Russian Orthodox Church, but that the two sides would discuss the issue in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> later this month. A priest of the underground church, <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Genrikhs </PERSON>, told the news conference that the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> church has no right to help decide the issue. `` If this is the price the Russian Orthodox Church is willing to pay, to deprive people of their church, then who needs this kind of Christian unity?'' he said.

 A former professional football player who pleaded guilty to killing four men, including two drifters whose ears were cut off, was sentenced today to 22 years in prison. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>, 31, who had been a member of the Yahweh sect, must serve at least three years in prison. He could have been sentenced to up to 27 years in prison. Dade Circuit Judge <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Morphonious </PERSON>' sentence was agreed upon as part of Rosier's guilty pleas to four counts of second-degree murder, said his attorney, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinkle </PERSON>. Security was tight during the sentencing. Rosier, who played defensive end briefly in 1979 for the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, wore the robe of the Yahweh sect even though he was excommunicated in June 1987. Members of the virtually all-black sect have claimed to be the true Jews and said their leader was the Messiah. They now downplay those ideas, seeking a more moderate image, but the group has been tainted by allegations of violence. Federal authorities have questioned Rosier about the sect's alleged links to as many as 12 killings The sect says it has about 8,000 members in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Rosier pleaded guilty to the October 1986 shooting deaths of <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Opa-locka </LOCATION>, and the September 1986 stabbing deaths of drifters <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Branch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> were killed when sect members tried to evict them from a crime-ridden apartment building as part of the sect's effort to fight drug trafficking

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today he has not decided whether he would accept the Democratic vice presidential nomination, if it is offered, but he said `` It is an option my constituency has earned.'' On the final primary day of the season, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> carefully outlined his position on the vice presidency in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. Asked whether <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should offer him the vice presidency, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` If he were to win, extending the invitation to me is his option.'' He said he did not know whether he would accept, but then added, `` It is an option my constituency has earned.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met Monday night and again today. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said they talked about a wide range of concerns, from his call on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to term <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state to his criticisms of the delegate selection process. `` He's sensitive on these matters and we're going to have some followup meetings, necessarily to discuss matters of platform, credentials, rules, the convention itself, and beyond that, our strategy for winning in November,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` As we increase our own security level, one with the other ... we accept our responsibility to guide our party to victory.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> concluded his primary campaign on a rough note, arriving late to his half-hour television program Monday night as it was broadcast in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s major markets. He had fallen behind schedule in earlier campaign appearances in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. As <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> raced from the airport, disc jockey <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasem </PERSON>, a longtime supporter, filled the gap by interviewing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s state campaign manager, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>. The show, costing the campaign $ 150,000, also featured footage of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> speaking to crowds in a video montage with a song about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the issues he has addressed in the campaign. When <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> arrived, he and <PERSON> Kasem </PERSON> spent the rest of the program discussing his campaign issues. `` I want to address our youth,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in closing, `` revive their spirit, renew their faith, keep hope alive ... I offer authentic leadership.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> earlier put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on notice that he will wage a convention floor fight over the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's refusal to say <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> should be declared a terrorist state. `` Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has proceeded rather cautiously and conservatively,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in a radio news conference during which he also criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' leadership. `` He has not been willing to declare <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state. By any definition of a terrorist state, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> qualifies,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. In the strongest terms he has used to date to indicate his priorities for the party convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` If he will not bend on that matter, we'll simply meet on the floor in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' Speaking on the eve of today's primaries in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> indicated he will fight to bend the convention to his concerns, but will do it within the structure of the party rules. `` It's not just what I want. I represent a constituency,'' he told a rally in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` What do my constituents want? ... What renews their faith, what makes their hope alive?'' he said. He then listed a litany of his campaign issues over such things as comparable pay for women, affordable housing and health care and fair prices for farmers. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said he plans to `` use the rules to have fair rules'' regarding delegate selection procedures that he considers unfair. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to join him in calling for designation of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a terrorist state because of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s backing for the brutal rebels in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and its policies of apartheid, press censorship and civil liberties restrictions. Countries on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> list of terrorist nations, such as <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, are subject to trade and political sanctions. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he is `` convinced the ticket will take a strong position against apartheid and declare <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to be a terrorist state.'' And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` either ... will offer leadership on these basic issues or be following the wave of a convention taking him out to sea.'' Asked how he could support the likely nominee if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> contends, lacks leadership, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> replied, `` It's not a question of integrity, it's a question of judgement and priorities. And the governor like all of us will keep expanding and keep growing.'' He also said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' willingness to use nuclear weapons in a first strike showed `` very bad judgment.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed regret Tuesday that the kidnaping of a prominent Colombian opposition leader has forced cancellation of a planned three-day visit here this week by President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>. `` We understand the reasons behind the cancellation and sympathize with the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Three space shuttle astronauts made a tricky mock emergency landing Tuesday during a comprehensive launch rehearsal that tested hundreds of changes resulting from the Challenger disaster. The practice for the nation's first shuttle mission in 2 -LCB- years, scheduled Aug. 31, exercised the launch team here and flight controllers in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> through the final three hours of a countdown and the harrowing minutes of a failure requiring split-second decisions. Astronaut <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, deputy director of shuttle operations who will make the final decision on whether a shuttle should be launched, said the test pointed up a few areas in problem-solving that needed to be improved, but `` all in all, it was an excellent exercise.'' Challenger's seven astronauts died when a faulty booster rocket caused their spaceship to explode Jan. 28, 1986. With the two boosters still attached and burning, the crew had no chance to escape; that is still the case. The simulated failure Tuesday of two of the three main engines occurred seconds after the boosters `` burned out'' normally and were jettisoned, enabling the three astronauts, operating in a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> simulator, to execute an abort maneuver called `` return to launch site,'' or RTLS. `` We think we've lost the left engine,'' astronaut <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON>, the simulator commander, told mission control slightly more than two minutes after the pretend liftoff. `` Discovery, we confirm the left engine is down. Abort RTLS,'' the control center radioed. <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> and his crew members, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetherbee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON>, `` flew'' the simulator to an altitude of about 75 miles and 400 miles out over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to exhaust hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel. With a second engine now `` locked up and useless,'' the astronauts pitched around, went through the motions of jettisoning their huge external fuel tank into the ocean and, battling hydraulic and other difficulties, glided to the make-believe touchdown on a runway three miles from the launch pad. Landing occurred 21 minutes after the abort maneuver began. Observing in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> were commander <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> and the four members of his crew who will fly the four-day Discovery mission in August. Because of the Challenger accident, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has introduced hundreds of changes, most aimed at safety, into the launch process. The changes include new procedures, management responsibilities and ground and flight hardware and software. The simulation Tuesday was the only opportunity to check them out with the launch-day team before the actual countdown. Under the new management structure, one man, <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, will make the final go-no go decision on a shuttle launch. His main adviser is launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON>. Both have scores of experts to call on. <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, a veteran of four shuttle missions, and <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> exercised their roles Tuesday as intentional electrical, communications and other problems were built into the count to give controllers experience in resolving them. A simulated high fuel pressure reading 31 seconds before liftoff would have scrubbed a real launch, but it was bypassed so the test could continue. The trouble-shooting delayed the simulated launch 55 minutes. The remaining three shuttles have been grounded since the Challenger accident, with the major roadblock to flight being the testing of the redesigned booster rocket. Two more full-scale firing tests are scheduled June 10 and July 26. Discovery is undergoing final checks after a major overhaul and is scheduled to be moved to the launch pad June 27.

 The leftist Sandinista government and rebel negotiators resumed talks today, and sources on both sides said they were close to agreeing on a definitive end to hostilities. As the talks began, <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> delegation leader <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said: `` The Nicaraguan Resistance is here with a political decision to sign a definite agreement for permanent and lasting peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if the government shows its political commitment to make the democratic reforms in this country to achieve that lasting peace.'' A major stumbling block in the fourth round of the negotiations on achieving a lasting peace is a timetable for disarming the U.S.-backed rebels, sources said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> want the rebels, known as Contras, to disarm by September. The rebels want to do it by the end of January. At the last parley May 26-28, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> made concessions on what the rebels call the democratization of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and pledged to enact political reforms the Contras demand. But rebel representatives speaking privately to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said the reforms remained too ill-defined. They include freedom of the press, lifting of all political restrictions, ending the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s control of the army and government, the right to strike and electoral reforms. The government also said it was willing to negotiate reforms within the framework of its dialogue with the internal opposition. The Contras reluctantly agreed at the last negotiating session to extend a 60-day cease-fire that would have expired May 31. But they said they would not observe the truce past the end of this week's talks The government had announced a unilateral 30-day extension of the truce. Since the talks last month, each side has accused the other of violating the truce. At least one Sandinista army soldier and 10 rebels have been killed, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said Monday that the rebels were prepared to resume fighting if the talks failed. `` The Nicaraguan Resistance does not want to reinitiate the war, but if the Sandinista government suspends the conversations, our forces will be ready,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. The Resistance is the Contras' umbrella organization. On Monday night, Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> told reporters an accord with the rebels was `` a matter of moments because at best within a month they will not have the capacity to negotiate more.'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> also said negotiations only became possible because the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been unable to win <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> support for continued military aid to the rebels. Despite their posturing, the government and rebels appear to be closer to a permanent agreement than at any time since they signed their historic peace outline on March 23 in the southern border town of <LOCATION> Sopoa </LOCATION>. The Sandinista government needs to end the war, now in its seventh year, to reconstruct an economy badly ravaged by the fighting that has claimed more than 26,000 lives and to enact the social programs it promised when it came to power in a 1979 revolution. At the same time, the Contras are experiencing deep divisions among their ranks and were cut off from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance at the end of February.

 A car bomb exploded near a Syrian army checkpoint in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, touching off a gun battle between <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> troops and pro-Iranian fundamentalist militiamen, police said. They said six people were killed and 40 wounded in the mid-afternoon blast and ensuing shootout in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seaside <LOCATION> Ouzai </LOCATION> district. It was the third car bombing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. Four people were killed and 39 wounded in the car bomb explosion, police said. Among the injured were two Syrian soldiers and two Lebanese policemen manning a joint checkpoint on the <LOCATION> Ouzai </LOCATION> highway, police said. The site of the blast was about 300 feet from an office of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, the most radical Shiite Moslem group in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A carload of bearded <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunmen raced to the scene. But Syrian soldiers and Lebanese policemen ringing the blast site intercepted the car and ordered its occupants out, police said. `` When the gunmen refused to step out, troops and policemen tried to haul them out by force. One gunman fired his pistol and a shootout erupted in which two gunmen were killed and a civilian passer-by was wounded,'' said a police spokesman. He can not be identified by name under standing regulations. One of the dead gunmen was identified as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Assaf </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> official. Reporters and photographers, watching from a distance, saw troops and policemen beating the gunmen with rifle butts through the car's open windows before the shooting began One gunman was seen drawing a pistol and firing at the soldiers and police, who opened up with submachine guns. Panicky onlookers sprinted away. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> deployed an estimated 2,400 troops in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums two weeks ago to quell three weeks of savage fighting between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia. Police had said 296 people were killed and 1,000 wounded in the war for control of slums, where most of the 18 foreigers kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed held. After the bomb-laden brown <PERSON> Datsun </PERSON> blew up at 4:05 p.m., ambulances were seen racing to and from the blast scene and fire engines doused at least two burning cars with water hoses. Syrian troops and policemen quickly removed debris from the area, where five shops were damaged. Today's car bombing came eight days after a car bomb detonated in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rmaeil </LOCATION> residential neighborhood, killing 20 people and wounding 78. On April 23, a car bomb blew up in a crowded vegetable market in the predominantly Sunni Moslem port city of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, killing 69 people and wounding 111. There has been no claim of responsibility for any of this year's bombings But leaders in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> blamed the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, for the blast there. The Lebanese Forces command, which denied involvement in the bombing, accused the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> secret service of masterminding the Rmaeil car bombing.

<HEAD>Attacks On Homosexuals Up Sharply as AIDS Makes Gays More Visible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The AIDS epidemic has made <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s homosexual community more vulnerable to attack, according to a study released Tuesday that said reported incidents of anti-gay violence rose 42 percent last year. A record 7,008 incidents, ranging from verbal abuse to murder, were reported in 1987 to the National Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrill </PERSON>, director of the group's Anti-Violence Project. The statistics were included in the report `` Anti-Gay Violence, Victimization & amp; Defamation in 1987,'' the third such annual study by the gay-rights advocacy group. `` We are a community under siege,'' <PERSON> Berrill </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` We are battling AIDS and we're battling violence.'' AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ has made the gay community more visible, <PERSON> Berrill </PERSON> said, and `` the downside of lesbian and gay visibility is once you're more visible, you're more of a target.'' Fifteen percent of all incidents reported last year and 5 percent of the physical assaults involved verbal reference to AIDS by the perpetrators or were directed against people with the disease, the study found. As in 1986, nearly two-thirds of the local groups reporting anti-gay incidents last year believed that `` fear and hatred associated with AIDS has fostered anti-gay violence in their communities,'' according to the report. The overall statistics represented a small percentage of the actual number of anti-gay incidents occurring last year, <PERSON> Berrill </PERSON> said. `` Gay and lesbian victims are probably the least likely to report of any hate crime victims,'' he said. `` Gay and lesbian people, by reporting crimes against them to the police, risk losing their jobs, their homes, and in some cases children.'' Nevertheless, `` available data clearly demonstrate that the problem continues to be severe,'' he said. <PERSON> Berrill </PERSON> called for federal and state legislation aimed at curbing anti-gay violence and better education of the public. Another reason for the increase in incidents reported may have been that the task force received more complete data than in the prior studies, <PERSON> Berrill </PERSON> noted. The 7,008 incidents in 1987 were reported by 64 groups in 32 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, compared with 4,946 incidents from 41 groups in 27 states a year earlier. The report was compiled by sending one-page questionnaires to more than 150 groups in all 50 states requesting any available local data on harassment or violence that occurred in 1987. Groups were chosen based on the likelihood of knowledge about local incidents. Among those groups documenting greater violence last year were <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION>, a gay victim-assistance agency, which saw 11 percent more violence victims in 1987 than in 1986. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project said it served 14 percent more clients in 1987, and the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lesbian </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reported a 39 percent increase in violent incidents. The greatest increases came in acts of verbal harassment and threats of violence, according to the report. `` Not only were there 1,990 more such incidents reported in 1987 than the previous year, but harassment and threats also constituted a greater percentage of 1987's total -LRB- 78 percent of all episodes in 1987 as compared to 70 percent in 1986 -RRB-,'' it said. Acts of vandalism also increased: 338 in 1987, up from 191 in 1986. While 835 physical assaults were reported in 1987, compared with 732 in 1986, they represented a slightly smaller percentage of total incidents: 12 percent in 1987, down from 15 percent in 1986. Reports of police-related incidents declined from 410 to 217. Other declines were in reports of arson, bombings, bomb threats and homicides. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> had more reported incidents than any other state _ a total of 1,985, of which 1,913 were harassment or threats, the report found. <PERSON> Berrill </PERSON> attributed this to the fact that organized hate groups are active in the state. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state led all others in the number of anti-gay homicides, the report found. Of a total of 408 incidents reported in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 20 were homicides. Sixty-four murders were reported nationwide. The study also highlighted federal, state and local initiatives to combat such violence, including passage of a hate crimes statistics bill by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last month. The bill would require federal collection of statistics on crimes motivated by race, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity. A companion bill has been introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif.

 The final round of the primary season was considerably less than an all-out struggle. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent less than $ 250,000 on television in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and nothing on TV advertising in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign said it was spending $ 700,000 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but even that was a relative pittance in the state with the most delegates of all. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, trying to avoid overshooting federal spending limitations, had no commercials and little organizational effort. His <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> office had one paid staff member and a handful of telephone lines. All this was in astonishing contrast to the primaries and caucuses at the beginning of the campaign season, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and their rivals of long ago lavished time and money on states such as <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. It was a marked contrast, as well, to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic campaigns of the past, when the outcome of nominating struggles hung in the balance to be tipped one way or another by the voters of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. And even as one primary season was ending, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was debating whether to make changes in the next one. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee heard testimony during the day on legislation to establish a regional primary system, with the states clustered into half a dozen geographical categories. Thus ended a primary season that began with the clamor of more than a dozen candidates but sorted out quickly. That was true particularly on the Republican side, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made short work of his five rivals even though he was very nearly an early campaign casualty. The vice president finished third in the lead-off <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses behind Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. But as his political obituaries were being prepared, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scored a stunning victory in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary followed by a solid win in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. He parlayed these successes into a 16-state sweep of Super Tuesday primaries on March 8. From then, it was a casual stroll to clinching the Republican nomination. Ironically, just as he conquered the Republican field, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was having trouble in the national polls. His standing plummeted as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's controversies mounted, and in the final weeks of primary campaigning, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began setting himself apart from the president on dealings with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and off-shore oil drilling. He said more differences with the president would emerge. `` We'll probably be dragged into more of these things rather than less, but I will try to keep it that I do n't go out and do something to tear down or be negative about this president It may not always be that easy,'' he said. The Democratic nominating campaign was more turbulent, but even so, it was essentially settled far earlier than seemed possible last winter. With front-runner <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> briefly sidelined by his <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> crisis, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was lumped with his rivals as one of the `` seven dwarfs.'' The pack, even when <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> re-entered, was seemingly overshadowed by speculation of a brokered national convention or a draft candidate such as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' route to the nomination mirrored the man _ steady and methodical. He finished third in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, as did <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, then rebounded to capture a back-yard victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. His Super Tuesday was considerably less so than the vice president's, but super enough. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> managed to pull out Southern victories in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with less than half the vote. He won at home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> the same day. But he stumbled the next time out, finishing third in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary and was embarrassed a few days later when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> trounced him in the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses. That was the end of his primary disappointments. He then began a springtime surge through the primaries that forced all his rivals but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> from the field _ and left little or no doubt that he would be the nominee. Leading to the final week of the campaign, he won nine of the last 10 primaries, often by landslide margins over his sole remaining rival, and gradually built his delegate totals toward the nomination.

 Almost 1,000 people have died of starvation in a parched southern town that has n't received relief food for about a year, and most of the deaths occurred in recent weeks, a Sudanese official said Tuesday. Sultan Pio Tem, commissioner of the eastern part of <LOCATION> Bahr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Ghazal </LOCATION> region, told reporters the victims were residents of <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION>, northwest of the regional capital <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION>. He said the victims also included people forced into the town by fierce fighting in the 5-year-old civil war. The rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> holds 90 percent of the countryside in the south. The government retains control of the large towns and cities, and many peasants have fled to them seeking army protection. Tem said the latest telegram he received from <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION> reported 786 people had died from hunger and hunger-related diseases from May 24 to June 1. He said 210 others perished earlier from the same causes and that starvation deaths continue to occur there daily. He did not say how many were dying each day. Tem was in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> seeking relief food for the town. He said he was to meet with <PERSON> Darios </PERSON> <PERSON> Beshir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Ghazal </PERSON>'s regional govenor. Tem said relief supplies had not reached <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION> since a consignment of rice and edible oil arrived by train a year ago. Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> has not replied to an appeal for food and medicine addressed to the government and to Western relief organizations, <PERSON> Tem </PERSON> said, adding he was trying to meet with <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> to urge him to declare <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION> a hunger area. <PERSON> El-Mahdi </PERSON> has announced that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is sponsoring a program to transport relief food to the south, but no date has been set for the operation. The <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION> took up arms against the government in 1983 to demand more autonomy and administrative and economic reforms. The years of fighting have corresponded with one of the worst famines in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> in years.

 Former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> on Tuesday urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to order a system of regional presidential primaries to replace a hodgepodge that `` cries out for reform.'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, who won the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 but lost the general election to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, testified in support of a bill that would require such regional primaries, with the dates to be decided by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. It would also outlaw inter-party crossover voting in primaries. The measure is sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., though he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that the bill `` is not my brainchild. He noted that similar legislation was introduced by then-Sen. Mondale of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> in 1974 Mondale, testifying on the final day of the 1988 campaign season, said the present nominating system `` is the hodgepodge result of a decades-long accretion of rules and amendments by the conventions and national committees of the two political parties.'' He said primaries in widely scattered parts of the nation on the same day, such as Tuesday's schedule of contests in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, make it impossible for candidates to address the issues and meet the voters. He urged the panel to support the bill, which would allow states to decide on a caucus or primary form of election but would require them to hold the event on a specific date, based on their region. The six regional primaries, according to the bill, would begin on the last Tuesday in March and end on the second Tuesday in June. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> would decide the order, by lots, each year. <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, drawing on his own experience, also criticized the influence of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, which hold the first-in-the-nation caucus and primary, respectively. In comments to reporters after his testimony, he said, `` I lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> for three years virtually. I could have gotten elected mayor in most of those towns, the same in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.'' `` My theory is we ought to rotate those states so you do that in other states. We never had a Southern state, a Western state. If we're going to do that, let's circulate it.'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said the present system is `` not all bad by any means,'' but `` nevertheless cries out for reform.'' He called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act now rather than drop the issue until the next presidential-election year.

<HEAD>Bush Struggles to Define Race; Dukakis Benefits From Long Primary
Fight</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The presidential primary season was kind to Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but disquieting to Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who struggles to define the race in his terms despite clinching the nomination two months ago. The primary election results and the current polls could be likened to the electorate's first impressions of the candidates, impressions likely to change as they get to know the contenders better in the fall. Right now, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is riding a wave of public desire for change. After nearly eight years of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the public may be looking for something different, a change of direction. Democratic and Republican pollsters alike report Americans are uneasy with the economy and concerned that the country is headed in the wrong direction. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is suffering from an inability to define the race in his terms. Peace and prosperity is a theme that has worked well for Republicans in the past, but, so far, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has n't been able to convince voters that it applies today. `` I ca n't wait for this primary season to end,'' the vice president tells rallies. From the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> viewpoint, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has had the best of all worlds the past three months. The contest for the Republican presidential nomination effectively ended on March 8, Super Tuesday, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> swept 16 primaries and sent Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> staggering back to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> in search of a miracle. Any lingering doubts about the outcome ended a week later with another <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> landslide in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>; he mathematically locked up the nomination in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> on April 26. The GOP race was over, a footnote to news accounts of the struggle among the Democrats. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ran poorly in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> where the big Democratic winners were two home state favorites, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. When the scene shifted to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, things looked even worse for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. He was beaten again, this time by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Where's <PERSON> Mario </PERSON>?'' came the cry from Democrats nervously looking for a winner. But Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> preferred the role of kibitzer to that of candidate. The nervousness among Democrats proved unfounded. When the contest came down to a choice between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor ran off with a string of victories. Nearly every Wednesday morning for two months, Americans learned of yet another <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> victory. As one Republican strategist put it: `` With every victory he grew another inch.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chafed under another reality of the Democratic race: In a Dukakis-Jackson contest, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor came off as the moderate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lamented that one national poll found two-thirds of the respondents considered <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> more conservative than the vice president. `` There's something weird about that,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. There also is the prospect that things will get worse for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before they get better. The Democratic convention is in July, and if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> succeeds in resolving some potential pitfalls and presents a festival of unity for four days on national television, he is almost certain to get another boost in the polls. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> concedes that the vice president could be trailing by as much as 20 points in surveys before the Republican convention in August. But before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can send out invitations to his inauguration, he has some problems to resolve. The biggest one is <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The former civil rights leader has a hold on the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s most loyal constituency and many of his followers think <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> must be offered the vice presidential nomination _ an offer <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is n't likely to make unless he is certain it would be turned down. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also is threatening to wage convention fights for platform planks he favors. There are no foreseeable conflicts for the GOP convention, allowing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to gain maximum benefits from the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> coronation. And as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reads the current polls showing him trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he also can take comfort in the fact that when voters start focusing on presidential campaigns in the fall, the race inevitably tightens, often dramatically.

<HEAD>Japan Most Often On Governors' Overseas Itineraries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When governors pack their bags and passports, where do they go? In 1987, they headed most often to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. It said governors from 43 states and territories made 87 overseas trips during 1987, often stopping in more than one country. But the most frequent destination was <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> -LRB- 36 trips -RRB-, followed by <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> -LRB- 19 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> -LRB- both 17 -RRB-, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -LRB- 13 -RRB-, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> -LRB- both 9 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> -LRB- all 6 -RRB-, and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> -LRB- all 3 -RRB-. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were each visited twice. Countries that drew a single governor were: <LOCATION> Anguilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saipan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>. The association said governors usually go abroad to encourage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, increase foreign investment and promote tourism. The 87 trips was nearly double the 45 overseas trips governors made in 1986. `` Nowadays, most governors are making one to five overseas trips a year to sell their states' resources, goods and services,'' according to an article in the Governors' Weekly Bulletin.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters Tuesday decided whether to shut down a nuclear plant and permit the quarantining of AIDS victims, while two <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> councilmen vied for a chance to become <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s first black congressman. Four <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races also were on the ballots as seven states held primaries, and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> had a wide-open race for governor, highlighted by former Democratic Gov. Thomas Judge's comeback bid. The liveliest <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where polls showed state Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> leading three fellow Republicans for the nomination to oppose first-term Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>. Three other <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primaries were all Democratic skirmishes leading to the main event in November. First-term Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> had two little-known opponents as he sought to defend his seat against Republican <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON> had one challenger in his bid for a third term against Republican <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> was favored over three rivals to win a chance to face Republican Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>'s heavily <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> 10th district, where Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> was retiring after 40 years, black City Councilmen <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> competed in the Democratic primary. The winner was expected to defeat the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, political newcomer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who also is black. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, Judge was one of six Democrats who entered the race for governor after Democrat <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> decided not to seek a third term. Former state Sen. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> and state Rep. <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON> were the only Republican candidates left after the early favorite, Secretary of State <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Waltermire </PERSON>, was killed in a plane crash in April. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was seeking a full four-year term and needed a majority in the non-partisan primary to avoid a runoff in the nation's seventh-largest city. Californians confronted their usual slew of ballot measures, including proposals to ease state spending limits, curb campaign spending, slow growth and declare AIDS a communicable disease, subjecting victims to potential quarantine. In <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a measure seeking closure of the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear power plant could mark the first time in history that voters have directly ordered the shutdown of such a facility. And in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, geographically the nation's largest, voters were asked to carve away the eastern, desert portion to create a new jurisdiction called <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Here are highlights of voting in the other states: <LOCATION> ALABAMA </LOCATION> _ Circuit Judge <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a son-in-law of former Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, was running for the Democratic nomination to state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on a slate supported by trial lawyers and opposed by big business and insurance companies. <LOCATION> IOWA </LOCATION> _ Sixteen supporters of extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> were running in Democratic primaries, five for congressional nominations and the rest in state legislative districts. <LOCATION> SOUTH </LOCATION> <LOCATION> DAKOTA </LOCATION> _ No statewide races were on the ballot and there were only 26 primary races for the 105 state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats.

 In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races, the national <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> has hopes of unseating both <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>. New Mexico Republicans have portrayed <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> as too liberal for a state that has long supported heavy defense spending. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, a Heisman trophy winner, <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> scholar and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War hero, moved to the Garden State to enter the race and based his early campaigning mainly on his impressive resume. Both states have <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governors who will campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> has been far ahead of <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> in fund-raising and the polls. His biggest obstacle appears to be a jinx on his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat which has prevented any occupant from winning re-election in more than 30 years. Burns, the Republican nominee in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, is a commissioner in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> who has yet to achieve much statewide recognition. A <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> man withdrew from the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race too late for his name to be taken off the ballot. <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON>'s retirement after two terms in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> left the governorship without a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> incumbent on the ballot for the first time in 20 years. <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> had defeated Judge in the primary in 1980. <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> chairman who led the impeachment hearings against former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, is stepping down amid growing sentiment that his predominantly black district should be represented by a black. He made no endorsement in the primary. The AIDS measure, sponsored by <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> supporters, was opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the leadership of both major parties. It was almost identical to a plan defeated by a 2-1 margin in 1986.

<HEAD>Kitty Dukakis to Leave Hospital Less than a Week After Surgery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plans to leave <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, less than a week after undergoing neck surgery to eliminate a condition that could have caused paralysis. The wife of Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Tuesday in a telephone interview that doctors at the hospital told her she could leave later this week. `` My neck is fine. I'm walking without help. I have just a little pain in my hip,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Her hip pain is the result of Friday's surgery in which doctors removed two small bone fragments and used them to replace two herniated discs in her neck. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was alert and sitting up in bed, but sounded slightly hoarse in the interview. She said she longed to be with her husband for Tuesday's <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary, the last event in the long pre-convention season `` I wish I was somewhere else,'' she said shortly after speaking to her husband at 6:30 a.m., <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> time. `` He sounded a little weary.'' In the meantime, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sorted through piles of gifts and cards and walked the hallways of the hospital, visiting other patients. She said she received `` lots of candy, fruit and flowers'' from friends, relatives and some of her husband's Democratic rivals, but nothing, so far, from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or the certain Republican nominee, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Doctors have prescribed rest at home for Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> when she leaves the hospital and a curtailed campaign schedule until the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, which opens July 18 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zervas </PERSON>, chief of neurology at the hospital, told Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that she would have to wear a neck brace for, at most, eight weeks _ a period that could include the convention. `` If I have to, big deal,'' she said of the possibility of joining her husband at the podium in a brace. Doctors plan to take X-rays next month to make sure her neck is healing properly, she said. <PERSON> Zervas </PERSON>, a longtime family friend, led a team of surgeons in the operation on the 51-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Doctors said that if the ailment had gone undetected much longer, she faced the risk of paralysis. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said she began to feel the warnings signs that something was wrong a month before she was diagnosed last week. `` I did n't have much time to think about it,'' she said. `` One tends to slough things off in a campaign atmosphere.'' Early in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential campaign, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> acknowledged that she had kicked an addiction to diet pills that had lasted more than two decades. She said Tuesday she is trying to limit the number of pain killers she takes to help her through her recovery.

<HEAD>Pepper Rallies His Forces for Floor Fight on Long-Term Care Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> marshaled an array of influential lawmakers Tuesday as he prepared for a do-or-die effort in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to pass a costly new home health care program. Pepper's plan, scheduled for floor action Wednesday, would expand Medicare to include long-term home care benefits for anyone of any age who is chronically ill or ca n't perform tasks of daily living. With opponents mobilizing to prevent a vote on the bill, Pepper rallied his own forces Tuesday at a news conference: Sens. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsor of the bill; and Reps. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., who holds 4 leadership position in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> health subcommittee `` We have a total vacuum'' when it comes to long-term care,'' Pepper, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said `` A million people a year become destitute trying to pay for catastrophic care.'' The Pepper bill has provoked criticism on several counts, among them its high cost, its lack of a nursing home component and the unorthodox manner in which it bypassed committee scrutiny and sped to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. `` We should not allow the rules of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to be manipulated to satisfy the popular issue of the moment,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., said Tuesday in a letter to his colleagues He said the committee system `` protects members from being forced to vote on popular-appearing proposals that may ultimately prove to be embarrassing.'' The Pepper bill is putting <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, particularly Democrats, in a bind because withiout their support there is no chance <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will pass the bill before adjourning this year. There is overwhelming public sentiment in favor of a long-term care program. There also is an election in six months, and the 87-year-old Pepper, who is popular with elderly voters, has made campaign appearances on behalf of many lawmakers in the past. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates the home care program would cost nearly $ 28 billion over five years. It would be paid for by imposing the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payroll tax on income above $ 45,000, which is currently exempt. Supporters of the plan also backed a new catastrophic care benefit bill to help the elderly cope with acute illness. That Medicare expansion, more than a year in the making, has passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and is expected to pass the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this week. But <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> called that measure `` only half the roof that people need to shield them from health care catastrophes. ... I always feel guilty calling this other bill the catastrophic bill.'' Pepper initially tried to attach his plan to the catastrophic bill, but withdrew it when lawmakers said it would sink that legislation. In return, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, agreed to let Pepper have a separate floor vote on his plan. Pepper, chairman of the rules committee that schedules floor action, scheduled his own bill last year, effectively bypassing <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s committee and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> headed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., which ordinarily would have considered the Pepper bill <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> complained in his `` Dear Colleague'' letter that the bill was brought to the floor via `` an extremely unusual and troubling procedure.'' He also said the agencies necessary to administer the Pepper plan do not exist and `` history has demonstrated that such a big program can not be put in place quickly without encouraging inept or fraudulent management.'' And he said <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> estimates show the program would face an annual deficit within five years. Pepper dismissed the notion that he was abusing the committee process, saying what happened with his bill was unique and would not become routine. `` The rules committee is not going to run rampant over anybody,'' <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` All they want to do is kill the bill and use the money for something else.'' In a `` Dear Colleague'' letter of their own, dated June 8, Pepper and his co-sponsor, Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, D-Calif., called cost and procedure issues `` bogus'' reasons to oppose the bill They said the bill contains a cap on costs and does not violate any procedural rules of the House. They also said outside opposition groups such as the insurance industry would oppose any long-term care bill because `` they serve their own narrow self-interest, not the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people's interest.''

 Widespread violence and eight deaths were reported Tuesday, the second day of a nationwide general strike that organizers claimed involved 2.5 million people. Employers and transport companies said support for the strike had dwindled and that more workers were on the job in many areas. In <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> said the strike had intensified around the nation's third-largest city. Black labor unions and anti-apartheid groups called the three-day protest, which the government says is illegal, to oppose the 2-year-old state of emergency and proposed legislation to restrict the rights of unions to strike. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the largest black labor federation, said at least 2.5 million people were staying away from jobs and schools. It called the strike the most significant to date. General secretary <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON> denied government claims that the protest was being sustained by intimidation. He told reporters the strike was `` a reflection of the wide-scale resentment and anger'' about orders issued in February that barred his organization and other anti-apartheid groups from political activity. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s government imposed the emergency June 12, 1986, to combat a black uprising against apartheid, the policy of race discrimination that preserves privilege for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites and denies the 26 million blacks a voice in national affairs. In <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, the exile headquarters of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement declared `` unequivocal support'' for the strike. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the main group fighting white domination in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said: `` The strike appears to enjoy the overwhelming support of the disenfranchised majority in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and has so far been peaceful. `` We hope all parties will continue to avoid violence. The strike underscores the urgent need for negotiations among South Africans to replace apartheid with a democratic constitutional order.'' The three-day strike is the largest black protest under the emergency. A report by state-run <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said participation declined by 45 percent Tuesday but gave no estimate of the number of people involved. It said in an editorial that the strike represented the strategy of `` radical activists who want to make <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> ungovernable.'' Police would not comment on the scope of the protest because, they said, emergency regulations prohibit such reports. Headquarters advised local news media to consult lawyers before publishing stories about the strike. Authorities reported more than two dozen incidents of violence Monday night and early Tuesday, including fire-bombings and stonings of homes, buses and trains. Twenty-one arrests and 23 injuries were reported. Officers shot to death a young black when a municipal police unit was stoned, according to police spokesmen. They said seven other blacks, including three children, were killed in shootings, a hand grenade attack and a fire-bombing. Five of the deaths occurred near <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. There was an unconfirmed report of four more killings there. The protest has aggravated a feud in the area between black militants and more conservative blacks who support Zulu leader <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, an opponent of strikes and other confrontational tactics. The mining industry, which produces 80 percent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s export earnings, has been only slightly affected by the strike Only one gold mine reported significant absenteeism. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mineworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and mine owners gave conflicting reports of strike action at diamond and coal mines, but the union conceded effects were limited. All seven major auto assembly plants were closed. According to <ORGANIZATION> PUTCO </ORGANIZATION>, a private bus company that carries 300,000 black commuters daily, ridership from <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s huge black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> increased from 10 percent of normal Monday to 25 percent Tuesday. It said traffic was near normal in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> but remained at 10 percent around <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said rail commuter traffic had increased dramatically in most areas. In some black areas around <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> where transport was disrupted, police used trucks to carry people to the nearest functioning bus routes. Schools remained empty in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> and other black townships. Many students are expected to extend a scheduled vacation period that begins Monday by staying home the rest of this week. The Star of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the country's largest daily newspaper, said in an editorial: `` There will be no winners in this ill-considered clash. The country will never know how many who stayed away did so out of political conviction, how many out of fear of retribution or simply the chance of a day off.''

 Question: Is 26.9 percent `` fully a third''? The correct answer is no, but 26.9 percent is described as equaling a third in a foreword to the federal mathematics study released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Anrig </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the government-sponsored testing program, wrote in a preface that, `` Fully a third of our 13-year-olds have n't mastered skills universally taught in elementary school.'' The executive summary of the report also said it was `` alarming that one-third of these students'' did n't score 250 on the 500-point test, a level indicating they can perform basic operations and begin to solve problems. But a chart accompanying the test indicated that in 1986, 73.1 percent of the 13-year-olds actually reached that level, up from 64.9 percent in 1978. The full text of the report, `` The Mathematics Report Card: Are We Measuring Up,'' referring to the same statistics, says: `` It is alarming that one-quarter of the seventh and eighth graders _ amounting to more than three-quarters of a million students _ may not possess the skills ... necessary to perform many everyday tasks.'' <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashworth </PERSON>, a spokesman for the National Assessment, acknowledged that `` fully a third'' was a mistake, and expressed surprise that it had gotten past the report's proofreaders.

 A French editor paid a record $ 1 million for the rights to publish the French version of the sequel to the American classic `` Gone With the Wind,'' the editing company said Tuesday. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Belfond </PERSON> of Editions <PERSON> Belfond </PERSON> said it was the largest sum ever paid for translation rights by a French publisher. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> is paying novelist <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> nearly $ 5 million to write the sequel to <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s only novel The sequel, which has yet to be named, is to be released in 1990, said <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiltz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The French firm outbid six others in an auction last week to acquire the rights from the <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which controls overseas rights to the book, <PERSON> Belfond </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s novel, enormously successful when it was published in 1936, was the basis for the film classic starring <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> as <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> as <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>. <PERSON> Belfond </PERSON> has published translations of other best-selling American novels, including <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Susann </PERSON>'s `` Valley of the Dolls.'' French publisher <PERSON> Gallimard </PERSON>, which raked in millions with the translation of `` Autant en Emporte le Vent'' -LRB- `` Gone With the Wind'' -RRB- when it was published here in 1939, did not take part in negotiations for the sequel. A Gallimard spokesman said $ 1 million was `` an exhorbitant amount to pay for a doubtful return.'' <PERSON> Belfond </PERSON> acknowledged the purchase was a gamble. The French edition is expected to be on bookstore shelves by the end of 1990.

<HEAD>Federal Appeals Court Upholds Agency's Lowering of CAFE Standard</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> acted reasonably in lowering mandatory fuel economy standards to 26 miles per gallon, a federal appeals court ruled, 2-1, Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> lowered the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standard automakers must meet in 1986 from the 27.5 mpg set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to 26 mpg, asserting the higher standard was not economically practical. The state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the cities of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and four citizens groups, led by Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, filed petitions requesting a court review of the order. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION>, in an opinion by Judge <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s `` consideration of the likelihood of economic hardship within its assessment of ` economic practicability' must be given due weight.'' The agency's decision was based on analysis that concluded the higher standard would have severe economic effects throughout the auto industry, and therefore was not arbitrary or capricious as the petitioners had charged, the court said. The petitioners also asserted that <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>, by lowering the standard, had failed to consider the nation's need to conserve energy. The CAFE standards were initially adopted in the 1970s to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on foreign oil. The court, however, said the agency had weighed increased fuel consumption against economic harm under broad guidelines set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Had <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> offered a more precise balancing formula for the agency to apply, ... we could more confidently discern the agency's compliance with the congressional mandate,'' the court said In the absence of such precision, the court said it must conclude <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> had properly accomodated conflicting policies in lowering the standard. Mrs. <PERSON> Ginsbug </PERSON> was joined in the majority by Judge <PERSON> Abner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikva </PERSON>. Judge <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON> dissented. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> has called for repeal of the CAFE standards, saying in an era of cheaper energy they have outlived their usefulness and harm the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto industry's competitiveness Supporters of the standards argue they must be retained to keep the nation from again slipping into deep dependence on unreliable foreign sources of oil. Besides <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>, the petitions named <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Importers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as defendants.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed a constitutional amendment Tuesday making Islam the state religion. Thousands of opponents took to the streets in protest, blocking traffic and damaging vehicles. The 300-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, dominated by President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, passed the controversial bill 254-0. Fifteen members of minor opposition parties walked out before the vote. Two independents joined the <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to enact the bill, which was proposed May 11. The amendment makes an Islamic republic out of this once-secular state created after a 1971 war of independence from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Shortly after the legislation was passed, several thousand members of 21 non-voting opposition groups streamed into the streets. These parties have no representatives in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> because they boycotted March elections in which <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> won a 252-seat parliamentary majority. Witnesses said the mobs stopped traffic at several intersections in downtown <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> and damaged seven state-run buses and a police jeep. Riot police were on duty, but no clashes were reported. The proposed bill drew especially strong criticism from women's groups, opposition parties and minority religions in a country whose 105 million people are 85 percent Moslem There are an estimated 250,000 Christians in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, as well as Hindu and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> minorities. The bill amends the <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> Constitution to insert the sentence: `` The religion of the republic is Islam, but other religions may be practiced in peace and harmony.'' The government says the bill does not change the legal system to one that would follow the Koran, the Moslem holy book. Women's rights groups, however, fear that Moslem fundamentalists may use the amendment to pressure the state to pass more rigid laws following Islamic traditions, such as those requiring women to hide their faces behind veils. But observers say there is little possibility that the amendment would pull <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> into a social system resembling the Islamic fundamentalism of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. About 3,000 demonstrators _ including teachers, journalists and doctors _ marched through the streets of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> on Saturday to protest the change, shouting anti-government slogans. Christian leaders had appealed to <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> to withdraw the legislation. Among those who signed the statement was the Rev. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozario </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic archibishop of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, and representatives of other Christian denominations. Before the legislation was passed, Prime Minister <PERSON> Maudud </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> assured minority groups that they should not fear the amendment and told the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that the bill was `` to free Islam from the hands of fundamentalists and the traders of religion.'' But political analysts in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> have said they believe <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s main reason for launching Islam as the official religion was to woo Islamic fundamentalists, some of whom are campaigning against his regime for being too lax in supporting Moslem traditions <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, a former army general, came to power in a bloodless coup in March 1982 and was elected president in October 1986. The major opposition groups contend the elections were rigged. They boycotted the March elections, saying they also would be rigged, and vowed not to participate in elections until <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> leaves office.

 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it will help with an appeal on behalf of a 9-year-old boy and his parents, who refuse to medicate him to control his hyperactivity in school. The group agreed to assist <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesson </PERSON>'s lawyer in appealing a state hearing officer's decision that the boy must take Ritalin or an alternative drug to calm hyperactive children if he continues to attend regular public school classes next year. School officials in <LOCATION> Derry </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was manageable on Ritalin and that without it he has temper tantrums and is disruptive. His parents, <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Ritalin </PERSON> made <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> act like a drug addict with facial twitches, little appetite and insomnia. They stopped giving him Ritalin in April 1987 after he spent 18 months on the drug. The appeal likely will be filed in federal court, where precedent exists for such matters, <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebel </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> CLU </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director, said Tuesday. The first line of defense will be to assert <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s constitutional right to privacy when medical treatment is involved, she said `` For any government agency, such as the state <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, to violate that privacy, there must exist a compelling state interest and we do n't believe that has been proven,'' she said. The group's lawyers also believe <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s rights as an educationally handicapped child have been violated, <PERSON> Ebel </PERSON> said. Hearing officer <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Falkenham </PERSON> ruled last month that returning <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> to class without medication would harm his education and that of his classmates. <PERSON> Falkehham </PERSON> also said the <PERSON> Jessons </PERSON> would have to pay to have <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> placed in a more restrictive, specialized class if they refuse to medicate him. In an agreement between the state and <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s parents, he is being tutored until the school year ends later this month.

 Leaders of the nation's public and non-profit employee organizations joined with legislators Tuesday to denounce an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> proposal that would tax such benefits as vacation pay and sick leave, even if they are not used. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> decision is baffling and at some real level inhumane,'' Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said at a news conference. `` The moment you start taxing sick leave that is not used, people start using sick leave.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest public employee union, echoed the senator's objections. `` Whoever's doing the thinking on this is n't thinking very clearly,'' he said. <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON> estimated that if his union's 250,000 members used all their sick time and vacation leave every year, it would be the equivalent of an 18 percent cutback in the workforce. The proposal at issue was put forward by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> in January 1987 to change a section of the Internal Revenue Code. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> issued a public notice that Section 457 _ which provides rules for certain types of deferred compensation for employees of state and local governments and tax-exempt organizations _ would be interpreted to apply to `` nonelective'' deferred compensation. This would include such benefits as vacation pay, sick leave, compensatory time, severance pay, disability and death benefit plans. Until that announcement, public and non-profit employers had generally understood the restrictions of Section 457 to apply only to elective deferred compensation, or salary that an employee postpones receiving, <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> explained. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> introduced legislation Tuesday to amend the Internal Revenue Code to clarify that Section 457 would not apply to nonelective deferred compensation. At the same time, however, he conceded that the bill has little chance of passing this year because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not slated to address a major tax bill. He also wrote last week to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, urging that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> reconsider its position so the matter can be resolved without legislation.

 The drought that has gripped north <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is causing a new kind of battle among lawn-conscious suburbanites, some of whom are reporting their neighbors for ignoring tight restrictions on outdoor water use. <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been swamped with water calls, said operator <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who estimated that 90 percent of the department's recent calls have been about outdoor watering. `` They say, ` Their lawn's so pretty and green, how come they get to water and I do n't,''' she said. `` They're calling in on their neighbors, basically,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Cobb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> radio operator <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Reber </PERSON>. `` Some are pretty mad,'' said <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, deputy director of <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some just want to complain. Lots are just teed off at their neighbors.'' <ORGANIZATION> Gwinnett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaufait </PERSON> said his department received nearly 230 calls over the weekend. `` When a resident sees somebody else watering, I would imagine he would be irritated,'' <PERSON> Beaufait </PERSON> said. Almost every government in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area has restrictions on when lawns can be watered and cars washed. The city of <LOCATION> Roswell </LOCATION>, in northern <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, announced that it would ban outdoor watering 24 hours a day beginning at midnight Tuesday. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has banned outdoor watering from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. since November, and its water bureau is recommending that residents use water outdoors on odd or even days, depending on their address. Despite the bans, faucets in about 1,000 north <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> homes went dry from about 9 p.m. Monday until 1 a.m. Tuesday, said county water supervisor <PERSON> Hershel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>. He said the area, which bans outdoor watering from noon until 9 p.m., ran out of water because many residents `` just dragged out the water hoses and went to town'' when the ban expired Monday night. `` We were, for all practical purposes, out of water last night,'' he said Tuesday. About 200 homes in southern <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where water was purchased from <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, also lost water for three to four hours Monday night, said <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> water department director <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Heard </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> state climatologist <PERSON> Gayther </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> said there have been only 210 inches of rain in most parts of north <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in the last five years. The region averages 50 inches of rainfall per year, or 250 inches in five years. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>, the metropolitan area's primary water source, was at 1,062.7 feet above sea level Tuesday, 10 feet above its record low of 1,052.7 feet, set Dec. 24, 1981. `` All indications are that this is going to be a very critical drought in the northern part of the state,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Word </PERSON>, chief of water resource management for the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is going to be worse than'86.''

<HEAD>Growth of Consumer Credit Slowed in April</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans increased their installment borrowing at a moderate annual rate of 7 percent in April as growth in consumer credit slowed from the first three months of the year, the government said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said consumers took out $ 3.65 billion more in credit than they paid off in April, compared with net growth of $ 5.2 billion in March, $ 5.0 billion in February and $ 6.2 billion in January. The annual rate of growth in April was slightly slower than the 7.2 percent rate for all of 1987 and considerably slower than the approximately 10.7 percent pace for the first quarter of 1988. However, economists saw the slowing as a healthy trend at a time when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers are trying to boost their production for export. `` What's happened is what should be happening. Consumer spending is cooling off and freeing up resources to produce for export,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm. `` The whole transition from a consumer-led economy to an export-led economy assumes we can cool off consumer demand in order to avoid heated up inflation,'' she said. She said consumer debt grew faster than the norm in the January-March period because of a surge in auto sales. In April, auto loans grew by $ 1.55 billion, a yearly growth rate of 6.7 percent, compared with a rate of 15.9 percent in March and 14.5 percent in February. The category that includes credit card debt showed the strongest increase in April _ $ 1.61 billion for an 11.7 percent expansion pace, compared with 16 percent in March and 10.3 percent in February. The credit report said the category that includes bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate increased by $ 478 million in April, a 3.6 percent jump compared with a 3.7 percent decline a month earlier. Borrowing for mobile homes increased by $ 13 million, 0.6 percent, after a drop of 5.8 percent in March. The various changes left total consumer debt at $ 633.1 billion at the end of April, up 9.1 percent from a year earlier. Still, Ms. <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> said consumer borrowing as a percentage of income has remained steady at just under 19 percent for a year and a half.

<TEXT>
 A government-sponsored study concluded Tuesday that American students are doing miserably in math, and experts laid some of the blame on the redundant, slow-paced way math is taught in most schools. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> reported that almost half the 17-year-old students tested in 1985-86 proved incapable of handling math commonly taught in junior high, and nearly 27 percent of 13-year-olds were stumped by basic computations. `` Our ninth graders are taking what other peoples' seventh graders are taking,'' <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of education for research and improvement, told a news conference. `` We've got to get it going faster, repeated less and make sure that it's learned more.'' The study was based on exams given to nearly 15,000 students ages 9, 13 and 17 in 1985-86, and to a total of nearly 35,000 students in grades 3, 7 and 11. It was the fourth national assessment in math since 1972-73. The study, `` The Mathematics Report Card: Are We Measuring Up,'' said all three age groups made modest improvements in recent years, but mostly on low-order skills. Fewer were capable of advanced work in 1986 than in 1978. `` Despite signs of their progress across time, the 1986 performance of 17-year-old students was dismal,'' the report said. `` Only half the high school students demonstrated an understanding of even moderately complex mathematical procedures'' usually introduced in junior high. The report said math classes are `` dominated by paper-and-pencil drills on basic computation. Little evidence appears of any widespread use of calculators, computers or mathematics projects.'' More than a quarter of the 17-year-olds reported they usually do not understand what is talked about in mathematics class. Math instruction is `` dominated by teacher explanations, chalkboard presentations, and reliance on textbooks and workshops. More innovative forms of instruction, such as ... small group activities, laboratory work and special projects, remain disappointingly rare.'' `` The early emphasis on practicing computations may serve to divorce mathematics from real-world observations,'' the report said. `` Once students learn to rely on procedures, they tend to give up on common sense. ... This can lead to preposterous answers.'' `` We're seeing a lot of drill and practice on obsolete skills,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dossey </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> math professor. But the students tested in 1986 also reported getting more homework and tests in math, and more were enrolled in advanced courses. The report said 98 percent of the 9-year-olds and 100 percent of the older students knew simple arithmetic facts, but virtually none of the younger students and only 6.4 percent of the oldest could solve multistep problems and algebra questions. Black and Hispanic students, as well as those living in the Southeast, gained ground, but remain far behind the white majority. The National Assessment, administered by <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, tests a sample of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students in basic subjects every other year. <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, whose department pays for the testing, said that despite minority gains, only one black 17-year-old student in 300 and `` barely 1 percent of the Hispanic kids'' scored at the advanced level, compared with 7.6 percent of the whites. Lawmakers decried the study's findings. Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., called it `` tragic'' and said, `` To the question, ` Mathematics: are we measuring up? the answer is, simply, no.'' Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called it `` quite sobering'' and said it was `` shameful that Japanese companies seeking to open plants here must use graduate students to do calculations done by high schoolers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The tests indicated girls and boys `` had identical average mathematics proficiency'' at age 9, but boys outscored girls at 13 and 17. `` Females tend to outperform males on tasks where there is an obvious procedural rule to follow, while the reverse seems to be true when the strategy for solving the problem is less apparent,'' the study said. The National Assessment devised its own 0-to-500-point scale to chart students' proficiency. The percentages of 9 -, 13 - and 17-year-old students at or above the five proficiency levels in 1986 were: _ Simple Arithmetic Facts. 97.8 percent of 9-year-olds, 100 percent of 13-year-olds, 100 percent of 17-year-olds. _ Level 200 Beginning Skills and Understanding. 73.9, 98.5, 99.9. _ Level 250 Basic Operations and Beginning Problem Solving. 20.8, 73.1, 96.0. _ Level 300 Moderately Complex Procedures and Reasoning. 0.6, 15.9, 51.1. _ Level 350 Multistep Problem-solving and Algebra. 0.0, 0.4, 6.4. The average score for 9-year-olds tested in 1986 was 221.7; for 13-year-olds, 269, and for 17-year-olds, 302. For white students, the average scores for the three ages were: 226.9, 273.6 and 307.5. For black students, 201.6, 249.2 and 278.6. For Hispanics, 205.4, 254.3 and 283.1. In separate grade-level scores, <ORGANIZATION> Asian-American </ORGANIZATION> students trailed whites in grade 3, but were far ahead in grades 7 and 11. The Asian-Americans averaged 211.3, 288.6 and 330.6.

 Worshipers at <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in search of the biblical land of milk and honey need only look to the rafters. At least that's where the honey _ along with an estimated 50,000 bees _ is hiding. The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fricke </PERSON> said the bees took up residence in the cathedral's rain gutters and under the roof about 10 years ago. They never caused a problem, he said, except for the occasional dripping of honey down an inside pillar.

Working on a 40-foot scaffolding Monday, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> estimated there is a colony of 50,000 bees and the honeycomb contains as much as 1,000 pounds of honey. The church had hoped to save the honeycomb and bees, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, but the large size and location, extending under the roof, made it impossible. A scraper pole will be used to break the honeycomb into pieces, remove it and collect the honey.

 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> crews mistook undersea rocks for alien submarines and dropped depth charges on them during recent anti-sub operations, a defense staff spokesman said Tuesday.

Sailors fired charges at another object Sunday off <LOCATION> Oxelosund </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> east coast, said spokesman H.G. <PERSON> Wessberg </PERSON>. Later checks by frogmen showed that the `` intruders'' were rocks that resembled submarines, he said.

 The first Indian soldiers were withdrawn from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> on Tuesday since <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sent more than 50,000 peacekeeping troops to the island 10 months ago. About 400 soldiers sat cross-legged on a dock in this port city waiting to sail home to <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Indian officials had said earlier that as many as 3,000 Indian soldiers would be withdrawn this week. But, citing security reasons, they declined Tuesday to give specific figures. Indian army musicians played martial music on bagpipes as about a dozen armored personnel carriers and several jeeps and trucks were hoisted aboard an Indian freighter. `` Do not call this a withdrawal, but a thinning out of troops,'' said Sri Lankan Gen. <PERSON> Sepala </PERSON> <PERSON> Attygalle </PERSON>, who attended the ceremony in <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION>, 150 miles northeast of the capital of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The Indians first began arriving on July 30, a day after <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> signed an Indian-brokered peace accord aimed at ending the civil war in the northeast of the island between Tamil rebels and the Sinhalese Buddhists. Many among the Sinhalese have opposed the presence of the Indian troops, who they fear may stay on the island. `` This is the beginning of the end of suspicions and apprehensions about <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s intentions on <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>,'' said Indian High Commissioner J.N. <PERSON> Dixit </PERSON> _ the equivalent of ambassador _ who spoke to a news conference in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> after the ceremony. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> A.S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalkat </PERSON>, the Indian commanding officer in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> lanka </LOCATION>, praised his departing men for their sacrifice in helping <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> restore order in the areas dominated by Tamil guerrillas. At least 480 Indian soldiers have been killed fighting the rebels. The latest victim was an Indian soldier who died only hours before the departure ceremony, when a bomb set by the rebels exploded as his jeep passed. Four others were injured. A Sri Lankan officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the attack six miles south of <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> was intended as `` a slap in the face'' of the departing Indians. `` All Sri Lankans should thank -LRB- the Indians -RRB- for their services and fighting to preserve the independence and unity of this country,'' Sri Lankan President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> said he expected the fighting to end soon in the northeast so that elections could be held there for new provincial councils. The peace accord called for the Tamils to lay down their arms in exchange for the creation of district councils, which would allow the Tamils to take control of their local schools and social services. But elections to choose the councils have not been scheduled in the Tamil-dominated areas because of the continued fighting. Government officials have said they hope to hold them by July. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, claim they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese Buddhists. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved because its own 60 million Tamils are sympathetic to their Sri Lankan brethren, who launched an independence campaign on the island in 1983. The largest and most extreme of the rebel groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, rejected the peace accord and continued fighting.

 For 18 years, police ignored complaints that one of their own regularly beat his wife and children, and now his oldest child stands accused of shooting his father in revenge, an attorney said Tuesday. Authorities charged <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 18, with attempted murder in the shooting Saturday of policeman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, whom a judge labeled `` a time bomb'' after hearing allegations of abuse. The teen-ager woke his father sleeping on a couch and said, `` This is for you'' before blasting him six times with a .25 - caliber pistol, authorities <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON>, contends that over the last 18 years she called the police more than 100 times to complain that her husband was abusing her or their four children, said <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, the younger <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s attorney. `` It was just a regular procedure of her calling the police, complaining that he was beating her or beating the kids or threatening her with a weapon,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> alleged. Police did little, <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said, because `` there is a tendency for them to protect their own.'' Police have begun an internal investigation into the allegations by <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, said department spokeswoman <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Vicini </PERSON>. She said she could n't respond directly to the allegations. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> never went through with filing a formal complaint against her husband. Once, when she tried to press charges, her husband said he would swear out countercharges against his wife and their children, he said. `` So she dropped the charges because she did n't want to put her children through being charged for something they did n't have anything to do with,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. In a domestic dispute, the injured party may sign a criminal complaint and a court date will be set. If the crime is a misdemeanor, the defendant is held until posting bond; if it is a felony, a state's attorney is summoned to interview the complainant, witnesses and the accused, and decide whether to file charges. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 55, was in fair condition Tuesday with two gunshot wounds in the head and four in the neck, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Rea </PERSON>. Police records show that <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> has received psychiatric treatment and has been on disability leave because of emotional problems, <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Vicini </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> has been on disability but said she did n't know why. `` The shooting was caused, I believe, by a battered-son syndrome,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. `` The father would beat up the mother, and the son, who was the oldest of their four children, would intercede on behalf of the mother. `` The father would taunt him and say he was the mother's bodyguard and then beat the son.

After listening to the allegations, Associate Circuit Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolan </PERSON> reduced the son's bond from $ 500,000 to $ 10,000 and called the elder <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> `` an absolute menace to his immediate family.'' `` He's a time bomb who goes off and repeatedly goes off,'' the judge said. In the most recent incident, <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> threatened to kill his wife May 24 with a pistol and then chased his son around the yard, threatening to kill him, after he tried to help his mother. Police took the elder <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s gun but did n't arrest him because they considered it a domestic dispute, <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. `` When a policeman is called to the home of a fellow officer, he treats him as a fellow officer and he treats everyone else as an outsider,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. `` So if the officer is accused, they listen to him instead of the person making the complaint.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had told its inspectors to become more heavily involved in the `` hands-on'' surveillance of maintenance on older jetliners, agency officials said Tuesday. The directive is among a variety of actions planned within the agency as a result of a three-day industry conference concluded last week on how to assure that aging jetliners are kept in safe condition. The conference grew out of the April 28 accident in which a 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 tore apart during a flight, causing a 20-foot section of the cabin wall and ceiling to separate. A flight attendant was killed when she was swept from the plane. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckhorn </PERSON> said that among other steps resulting from last week's conference on aging aircraft, the agency would: _ Develop ways to improve the sharing within the industry of technical information about aging aircraft _ Establish additional testing techniques to determine the life of a jetliner _ Place increased emphasis within the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> on `` human factor aspects'' of aircraft maintenance and inspection to reduce the likelihood that such work is not being done properly The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> also plans at some point to examine some commuter aircraft for signs of aging, <PERSON> Buckhorn </PERSON> said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, following the lead of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, approved an energy and water development spending bill Tuesday that provides no money to begin construction of new water projects next year.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is considering going to the Republican National Convention, despite the political embarrassment some Republicans say his legal problems are causing Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Cabinet officers traditionally attend these events and the attorney general is prepared to do so,'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s tentative schedule calls for him to be present for part of the convention, with the precise dates of any appearance still to be determined. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> would not stay through the whole GOP convention, which runs from Aug. 15-18 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The attorney general has been the subject of a criminal investigation for nearly 13 months. The probe focusing on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement with scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 1 billion <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil pipeline project is about to end, and a report to be issued soon is expected to raise questions about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s conduct At the attorney general's request, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met privately in May and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> promised not to do anything that would jeopardize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidacy. White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has said that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal difficulties could hurt Republican prospects of holding onto the White House. Some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides have made similar public comments, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself has not. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was to meet late Tuesday afternoon with a group of moderate Republicans from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, known as The 92 Group. In recent weeks, the attorney general has met with conservative senators and congressmen, telling them he has no intention of stepping down.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament re-elected <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as its speaker on Tuesday, cementing his political and military power. Parliament voted in a firebrand cleric as <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s deputy. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s re-election to the key position came only five days after <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> named him commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces. That appointment followed two serious military defeats for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, reported that 187 of the 192 parliamentary deputies whose credentials had been approved since elections in April and May voted for <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. Five abstained. Radicals, many of them <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> supporters, made sweeping gains in the elections at the expense of conservatives who have blocked economic reforms. The elction sharpened divisions between radicals, who seek a centralized state-run economy, and the conservatives, who are backed by the `` Bazaaris,'' the wealthy merchant class. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, 53, was named temporary speaker when the parliament, or Majlis, convened May 28, pending a two-thirds quorum to elect a permanent speaker. He has been speaker since 1980. The Majlis also elected two deputy speakers Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. One is <PERSON> Hojatoleslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Karroubi </PERSON>, a middle-ranking cleric who is the militant head of the <ORGANIZATION> Pilgrimage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> and believed to have been responsible for masterminding riots by Iranian pilgrims in the Holy Moslem city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> last year. Hundreds of people died in the riots. The other is <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashemian </PERSON>, a little-known deputy from <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Rafsanjan </LOCATION> in southeast <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s re-election appeared to set the seal on his political power. He is already <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s representative on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which determines <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s strategy in the war. He sits on the Council for the Expediency of State Decrees, formed earlier this year by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to push radical economic reforms through parliament. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> also has strong links with the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, which is now more powerful than the Iranian army, and leader of the clerics who deliver sermons at the weekly Friday prayer sessions in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, an influential religious and political platform. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s widening power leaves him well-placed to become the kingmaker in the power struggle among <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fractious leadership that is expected to swell when <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> dies. The 87-year-old revolutionary patriarch has been reported in poor health. Speculation that his condition was deteriorating was heightened when he relinquished his constitutional position as commander-in-chief to <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, a middle-ranking cleric. There has been no hard evidence to support that. But the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s appointment indicated <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> may no longer be capable or willing to continue to run military affairs <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has designated a senior cleric, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein-Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, as his successor. But <PERSON> Montazari </PERSON> is opposed by many leading figures and is widely expected to be little more than figurehead for a small group of political heavyweights led by the charismatic <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> dies. <PERSON> Khomeinis </PERSON> appointment of <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, long a close aide, as military leader underlined that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has his confidence and is apparently being groomed to hold the reins of power in the critical era that will follow <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is also close to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s son and confidant, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>.

<HEAD>OTA Study Says Soviets Could Knock Out Anti-Missile System</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 4th graf bgng ``Pentagon and SDI ... '' to update with
reaction from SDI Organization.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could launch nuclear-tipped rockets that would threaten to knock out the proposed early-round version of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars anti-missile system, a scientific study said Tuesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system also would be threatened by the possibility that the enormously complex software needed to run its computers might fail the first and only time it would be used, the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> said. The conclusions are part of a 2-year-long <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> study that raises new questions about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s program, known formally the Strategic Defense Initiative. The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, in a statement, said the report `` reflects a decidedly more constructive and balanced assessment than previous reports by OTA.'' But the statement disputed <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION>'s comments about computer software, claiming the study failed `` to acknowledge the positive achievements and the real operating record of such systems'' as the Safeguard ballistic missile defense, which operated for a 10-month period early in the last decade. The <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> study was publicly released despite the fact that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had refused to declassify three chapters dealing with ways the Soviets could counter the American system. When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced his program in 1983, he proposed that it should be aimed at making nuclear weapons obsolete. SDI officials have been overseeing research into a wide variety of futuristic technologies, including lasers and beam weapons. But in the past two years, SDI officials and supporters of the program have been pushing for a less comprehensive `` phase one'' SDI system which could be started in the mid-1990s. The second and third phases of such a system would be constructed later. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that a phase one SDI system costing $ 75 billion to $ 150 billion could be deployed using a combination of ground-based rockets and space-based rockets that would be parked in orbiting `` garages,'' ready to fire at attacking Soviet missiles. But the Soviets could attack such a system with anti-satellite -LRB- ASAT -RRB- rockets using nuclear-tipped weapons, the <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> study said. The Soviets now have an operational ASAT system. The Soviet ASATs `` would pose a significant threat to all three defense system phases, but particularly to the first two,'' <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Such weapons deployed in quantity, especially with multiple decoys -LRB- to confuse the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system -RRB- would threaten to degrade severely the performance of a first - or second-phase'' SDI system, the study said The study was the second OTA report critical of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars plan. Other scientific reports have also questioned the feasibility of SDI goals. The <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> study also raised questions about the software that would be used to run the SDI computers. Other studies have raised questions about whether reliable software, which would be far more complex than anything previously put together, can be developed. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karas </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> study, said there is `` a significant probability'' that the software would fail the first time it was used in a real situation. The study noted that `` the nature of software and experience with large, complex software systems indicate that there may always be irresolvable questions about how dependable'' the SDI programs `` would be and about the confidence the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could place in dependability estimates.'' In addition, any attempt to realistically test the software could only be done by computer simulation and thus it would also be dependent on software, <PERSON> Karas </PERSON> said. The study said there are `` no adequate models for the development, production, test and maintainance of software for full-scale'' missile defense systems. <PERSON> Karas </PERSON> said he did n't understand why public release of the three chapters had been refused by the Pentagon. They were so general that the Soviets could not likely gain much military advantage from reading the material, he said. The study said it was difficult to come up with a `` precise degree'' of how well the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system could survive a Soviet attack because that would depend `` on the tactics employed by each side and on the evitable uncertainties of battle.'' The Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has consistently cut <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s requests for SDI spending The program is funded at $ 3.9 billion in the current fiscal year. For the 1989 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has voted $ 4.6 billion while the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has approved $ 3.5 billion, with a compromise to be worked out by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate-House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought $ 4.8 billion.

<TEXT>
 The office that handles final appeals for death row inmates told the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that it's out of money until the new fiscal year July 1, although it has three active death warrants to defend. `` I just said, ` I'm broke,''' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON>, Capital Collateral Representative, in describing his arguments before the high court. <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON> said he asked the court for some relief, either through staying the three warrants until the next budget year, or by having someone supply his office with additional funds. `` The question is, what relief can they give us and whose responsibility is it?'' <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Snurkowski </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general, argued that the agency can get through the remaining three weeks of the fiscal year without relief. The high court gave no indication on when it will rule, but <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Snurkowski </PERSON> expect a speedy decision. Of the three active warrants the office said it has no money to defend, one is for <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, whose execution is scheduled June 22 in the electric chair at <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Prison near <LOCATION> Starke </LOCATION>. The other two inmates are <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karr </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, scheduled to die July 7, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Peede </PERSON>, July 8. The <ORGANIZATION> CCR </ORGANIZATION>'s money woes, <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON> said, are the result of several facors, including the number of death warrants signed by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, moving the office into more expensive quarters and the large number of hearings and other expenses involved in handling death cases. <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON> estimates his office needs $ 60,000 to $ 70,000 to make it through the year. Its total budget is $ 1.4 million.

Until the move, the more than 200 costumes were stored for two decades in the dilapidated environs of the old <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION>. In a news conference Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> joined others in a plea on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> preservationist organization. `` Hollywood history should stay in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, at a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> museum,'' Miss <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> said security at the fashion institute was appealing, including security `` from environmental factors, financial ability and the type and number of conservators.'' The garments were originally part of a collection owned by <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. But the group could not raise enough money to establish a museum and the collection was sold to the city for $ 22,000. The costumes were first stored at a Bekins building, then moved to the old jail. `` I visited there -LRB- jail -RRB- in 1986 when there was a plumbing leak and everything was under two inches of water,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION>. `` A cape worn by <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> in ` <PERSON> Monsieur </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaucaire </PERSON>' was damaged.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed a land reform law early Wednesday that gives landowners the choice of dividing their property among tenants or sharing profits with them. The bill, which goes to President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> for her signature, is expected to benefit two million farmers in this largely agricultural nation of 7,100 islands. Land reform is considered essential to defeating the 19-year-old communist insurgency, which has its main support in rural areas. All but one of the 19 senators present approved the bill Tuesday. Sen. <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Paterno </PERSON>, a landowner, abstained and the other four members left before the vote. The 203-member House of Representatives passed the measure at 1:15 a.m. Wednesday by a vote of 152-20 with four abstentions. Officials have said the program, estimated to cost $ 70 billion, will be financed by foreign aid and assets of exiled President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his allies that were seized on grounds they were illegally acquired. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> governed the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for 20 years but was driven from the country in February 1986 by a civilian-military uprising that brought Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. A conference committee of the two houses had spent two weeks reconciling provisions of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions. Sen. <PERSON> Heherson </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, a former agrarian reform minister who sponsored the legislation, said it would bring `` democratization of the means of production.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s younger brother, voted in favor despite earlier doubts about the measure. `` There are a few sections that have to be amended, but for the first time this bill will really accomplish a genuine land reform,'' he said. The president's owns a 14,820-acre sugar plantation in <LOCATION> Tarlac </LOCATION> province north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillego </PERSON> sponsored the original House bill but withdrew after changes began. He voted against the legislation Wednesday and told his colleagues they were `` foisting a grand deception on our people.'' Each landowner may retain 12 acres and an additional seven for each direct heir over age 15 who will till the land. A landowner also has the option of sharing profits or giving tenants shares of stock instead of physically dividing the property. <PERSON> Gillego </PERSON> said farmers would oppose the profit-sharing option and it might `` result in agrarian reform, if you will, through a revolution.'' Leftist farmers' groups have said the bill favors landowners. It also provides for the transfer to farm workers of tracts of public land greater than 2,470 acres now leased to multinational corporations. Government lands will be the first distributed in the 10-year program. Private holdings of more than 50 hectares -LRB- 123.5 acres -RRB- will be parceled out in the first four years and smaller holdings later. Owners of more than 50 hectares will be paid 25 percent of the value in cash and those with less than 24 hectares -LRB- 59.9 acres -RRB- will be paid 35 percent in cash. Tax exemptions, shares of stock in government-owned or controlled corporations or <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> bonds will make up the rest of the compensation.

<HEAD>Government-Controlled Media Continue Attacks On Voiceless
Opposition</HEAD>

 The government-controlled media still attack an opposition rendered voiceless by the closure of four newspapers, a television station and three radio stations critical of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` I do not think they will allow the news media to reopen,'' <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>, director of the shuttered daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, said of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government. `` They can not co-exist with a free press. `` How can the government talk of elections next year when there is no freedom of the press?'' <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said in a recent interview. The government has indicated that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was indicted on charges of drug trafficking in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, may run for president in the May 1989 election. The dailies <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Siglo </PERSON> and Extra, the weekly Quiubo, Channel 5 television, and radio stations <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exitosa </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> KW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continente </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundial </ORGANIZATION> also have been closed. All are owned by critics of the Noriega-controlled government. The media controlled by the government or sympathetic to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> relentlessly criticize the opposition forces who want to oust the general, who as head of the nation's 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> is considered the country's de facto leader. The government's radio and television station and the three daily newspapers who support <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> constantly ridicule opposition leaders, often describing them as lackeys of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They also criticize the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies. Last week, the daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republica </ORGANIZATION> said in a headline that President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> has cancer because he once kissed an American flag. Only <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estrella </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's oldest newspaper, sometimes gives space to opposition comment. Opposition efforts to obtain court orders or get official word about reopening have been fruitless. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> was first closed on July 26. It was allowed to reopen Jan. 20, shortly before President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who owns Channel 5, was instead deposed by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. On Feb. 25, soldiers who said they were acting on the `` order of a higher authority'' closed down <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> again. Police have since guarded the building. `` We have no access to our equipment or files in the building,'' said <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>. `` We can not find out who ordered the closing down of the newspaper, what we are accused of or what is going to happen.'' The newspaper filed suit against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, holding him responsible for the closure. But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected the petition late last month, saying it had no jurisdiction and could not fix blame for the closure because the soldiers who shut down <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> had no written orders. On Monday, nine officials from the attorney general's office and three police officers went to the <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prensa </LOCATION> building for what they described as an `` investigation.'' They refused to provide any details about their inquiry. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Carles </PERSON>, chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, said the paper will put its case before the <ORGANIZATION> InterAmerican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and appeal for support from the embassies of several Latin American countries.

 A fire killed five children and two adults Tuesday in a second-floor apartment, and the sole door to the home was padlocked, the fire chief said. The padlocking violated city fire code, Chief <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Lickert </PERSON> said, adding that six of the victims were found beneath a boarded window that also may have prevented their escape. He could not immediately say if boarded windows broke city codes. The seventh victim was found in a second-floor hall, <PERSON> Lickert </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Butler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkhardt </PERSON> ruled the victims died of smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. Three adults were injured and hospitalized, officials said. The street-level access door for the apartments that burned was padlocked from the outside, apparently by the residents as a security measure, <PERSON> Lickert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lickert </PERSON> said the residents locked and unlocked the door by reaching through an adjacent window, but apparently could n't do it amid the fire and smoke. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackburn </PERSON>, who said she owns the building with her husband, Art, said she was unaware of the padlock. At least one smoke detector should have been in each of the three apartments in sleeping rooms plus another in the hall, but firefighters found only one smoke detector without batteries, <PERSON> Lickert </PERSON> said. City inspectors had noted the lack of smoke detectors in a previous inspection and <ORGANIZATION> Blackburn </ORGANIZATION> had them installed, but firefighters could not account for the missing detectors, <PERSON> Lickert </PERSON> said. The fire chief said the cause of the fire remained under investigation. The blaze started about 4 a.m. in a living room, firefighters said.

<HEAD>Bennett Says Chicago's `Worst' Schools Best Place To Try Changes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s public schools, labeled the worst in the nation by Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, could be the best place to try changes that would help students learn, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` There are radical proposals in the air,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` This may be a revolutionary time.'' Speaking to reporters after the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Foreign Relations, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> suggested the 430,000-pupil system consider a voucher plan in which parents could choose schools and the government would pick up the tab. `` If you tried it, tried it honestly and fairly, I would predict it would improve things dramatically,'' he said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> also said the school system's bureaucracy was `` the blob.'' He called for redistributing power to give parents and local school principals more say over curriculum, personnel and other policies. Last November, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s public schools, plagued by low test scores and high dropout rates, the worst in the nation and an `` education meltdown.'' He later accused teachers' unions of blocking reform. He said Tuesday that his view of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s system has n't changed much. `` If it's not the worst, it's too ... close to the worst,'' he said. Nearly 45 percent of the students who began school with the class of 1985 dropped out before graduating. State figures also show that half of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s public high schools ranked in the bottom 1 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools for student scores on the American College Test. But <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said that whatever comes out of efforts to improve the schools `` may be able to point the way for other school systems in the country.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> stayed out of a fight in the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> over a state income tax increase, although he said `` I am not convinced that it takes money'' to change schools for the better. He said any new state money for education in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> must be tied to a reform package that would shift power in the system. `` You must give the people who run your schools the power, the autonomy, to run those schools,'' he said. `` Then you must hold them accountable for the results.'' Calling any reform that did n't redistribute power `` nonsense,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said unions interested only in `` getting more and more for everyone'' may be hurt in the short run. But positive changes in schools would help unions in the long run by raising the professional esteem of teachers. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> visited two <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> schools in March at the request of <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. He said afterward that `` intransigence of special interests'' such as unions remain the biggest obstacle to reform. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> union, said then that cutbacks in government funds were the real culprits.

<TEXT>
 The National Gallery of Art will celebrate the 10th anniversary of its modernistic East Building with a two-year exhibition of its small but rapidly growing collection of 20th century art, gallery officials said Tuesday. The show, which will open Dec. 4, will include about 250 works by modern artists ranging from <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> to <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>. It will occupy more than half of the building's 55,000 square feet of gallery space on three of its five levels. `` The new exhibition will demonstrate our progress in expanding the gallery's collection of modern art,'' said director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. About 60 percent of the paintings, sculptures and drawings in the show will come from the gallery's permanent collection. Half of those were acquired in the decade since the East Building opened on June 1, 1978. The remaining works will be on loan from private collections. Curator <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> said that although the East Building was designed in part by architect I.M. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> specifically to house the gallery's modern art collection, the only permanent exhibition site for those works has been on the less visible concourse or basement level of the building. <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> said 20th century art was virtually non-existent at the National Gallery until the early 1960s, when the gallery received a gift of about 100 works of modern art from the <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> collection. Since then, he said, the gallery's collection has grown steadily with the goal of assembling a high-quality range of modern masters, although there is no pretense of matching the vast numbers of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Museum of Modern Art or Metropolitan Museum of Art. `` We acquire carefully, slowly and with great care,'' said <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON>, who estimated that about 90 percent of the gallery's acquisitions are gifts rather than purchases Two major gifts were made in 1986, when the gallery acquired more than 900 drawings and 100 paintings by American artist <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON> and `` The Stations of the Cross,'' a 15-painting series by <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>. The gallery's modern paintings, sculptures and decorative art objects have grown in the past decade from 272 to 613 works, compared with thousands in other collections. `` Our center of gravity is the old masters,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> conceded. The exhibition opening in December, involving extensive remodeling of the East Building's gallery spaces, will move 20th century art upstairs from the basement `` to give the collection a presence the public can count on,'' <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> said. The tower and upper levels will feature pre-World War II artists such as <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Matisse </PERSON>, <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Braque </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amedeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Modigliani </PERSON>. The concourse galleries will highlight the works of postwar artists such as <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the exhibition may embark on a national tour once it closes at the East Building in December 1990.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that legislation under consideration by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would slash $ 686 million from funds the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration seeks to combat drug abuse. `` At a time when various members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are calling for increased federal drug spending in the face of a drug crisis of unparalleled proportions, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and State appropriations bill ... would actually reduce'' fiscal 1989 funding, <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The budget office complained that the bill would provide `` essentially a freeze'' on the spending levels for anti-drug programs administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It said that instead of approving the $ 2.67 billion that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> requested in the budget for the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1, the committee proposes appropriating only $ 1.98 billion, or $ 686 million less than was sought. The bill being marked up by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> involves money for the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshals office and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys offices across the country. `` The president's FY 1989 budget requested sufficient funds to preserve the momentum of the federal government's war on drug abuse in the three key areas of prevention, treatment and law enforcement,'' <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement released at the White House. `` Should <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> provide less than the president's request, programs to combat illegal drugs will suffer.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> graduating class last month that he wanted to see the national drug debate depoliticized, and he proposed creation of a joint executive-legislative task force to recommend solutions. But no such joint task force has yet been constituted, although <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., have study groups working on legislative proposals <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> said that under the legislation the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is poised to recommend: _ There would be no financing of 177 new drug enforcement agents and support positions, at a cost of $ 44 million Plans for expanded intelligence capabilities and equipment, including aircraft and computer equipment, would have to be canceled. _ The government would not be able to carry out a proposal to add 3,400 positions at a cost of $ 574 million to reinforce the federal prison system _ It would be impossible to create 566 additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and support positions in the prosecution force, at a cost of $ 44 million, and the prosecution of major organized crime drug task force cases would be out of the question _ There would be no money for the anticipated addition of 161 to the staff of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Marshals office, at a cost of $ 24 million. Prisoner transportation and the delivery of drug defendants at trial sites would be adversely affected.

<HEAD>Interest on Fixed Rate Home Mortgages Climbed Again in May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate home mortgages continued to climb in May, encouraging Americans to turn to adjustable-rate mortgages, the government said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the federal regulator of savings institutions, said the national average for conventional, single-family loans jumped to 10.63 percent in early May, up from 10.48 percent in early April. It was the second consecutive monthly increase. Since peaking at 11.42 percent just before the October stock market crash, rates had dropped steadily, hitting 10.33 percent in early March. The bank board said rates on the most popular type of one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages, those with limits on how much the rate can increase, also rose, but not by as much. They increased to 8.68 percent in May, up from 8.61 percent a month earlier. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist of the bank board, said the percentage of mortgages with adjustable rates rose for the first time in five months to 53 percent in May, up from 49 percent in April. He attributed that to the widening of the spread between the two types of loans. The gap grew for two months in a row _ from 1.69 percent in March to 1.95 in May. A separate weekly report by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, show continued increases in fixed-rate mortgages through May. It said the average last week was 10.58 percent, the same as the previous week but up from 10.32 percent four weeks before. Freddie Mac averages are lower than the bank board's because they do not include add-on fees, known as points, which are paid by borrowers.

<TEXT>
 The extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it will withdraw its candidates from six legislative districts in favor of conservatives and asked the center-right coalition to reciprocate. Within hours, candidates from the center-right alliance of the Union for French Democracy and Rally for the Republic withdrew in a southern district that includes <ORGANIZATION> Marseille </ORGANIZATION>, a National Front stronghold. A statement by <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaudin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION> leader in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said a Socialist or Communist would be elected unless alliance candidates withdrew. Conservative leaders remain divided on whether to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is viewed as racist and xenophobic. The conservatives and President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s Socialists ran almost even in the first round Sunday of voting for the 577-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Computer projections favor the Socialists to win a majority in next week's runoff because of the way support is distributed. <ORGANIZATION> Marseille </ORGANIZATION> and its region has attracted attention because <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> voters could swing the results in 14 districts. A statement by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said its candidates would pull out in the six districts where they trailed other rightists in the first round. Party leader <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> members who finished ahead of conservatives in seven races in and around <ORGANIZATION> Marseille </ORGANIZATION> will compete in Sunday's runoff and expect reciprocal withdrawals. If the conservatives do not withdraw in those districts, the Socialist candidates are likely to benefit from the split in the conservative vote and win <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> seats with less than 50 percent of the vote. Any candidate who won at least 12.5 percent in the first round can compete in the runoff, but those without a chance to win commonly throw their support to one of the top two finishers. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Toga </PERSON>, one of the conservative candidates who withdrew, said he and three others who belong to the Rally for the Republic would not endorse the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our withdrawals are meant only to respect the will of the voters and to assure the defeat of the candidates of the left wherever possible,'' he said. Former Security Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON> said the reciprocal arrangement Tuesday was `` a local and not a national accord.'' Any alliance between the conservatives and <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s extreme right, even an unspoken local agreement in <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>, could backfire in the rest of the country. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noir </PERSON>, trade minister in the conservative government of <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> that resigned after <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s re-election May 8, said a deal with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION> might save three or four seats but cost about 60 elsewhere in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

 The suicide rate among jail inmates is nine times greater than that of the general population and continues to be the leading cause of death in city and county lockups, according to a federally financed study released Tuesday. `` Although the average length of stay in jail is approximately 6 to 11 days, 51 percent of all jail suicide victims were dead within the first 24 hours of incarceration and 29 percent committed suicide within the first three hours,'' the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Institutions and Alternatives said. `` While alcohol-drug related and minor ` other' charges account for 37 percent of offenses for which jail inmates are confined, they represented 55 percent of all suicide victims,'' according to the study of jail suicides in 1985-86. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> directed the project, which was supported through a grant from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said the suicide rate in detention facilities was found to be 107 per 100,000 inmates. Census Bureau studies show, he said, that the rate is 12.5 per 100,000 in the general population. `` Further, suicide continues to be the leading cause of death in our nation's jails,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said in a statement. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> recorded 32 percent of all the suicides in the study. Those states, according to <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures, also house one in three jail inmates. The numbers of suicides in jails was 453 in 1985 and 401 in 1986, the study said. The findings also showed that 72 percent of the suicide victims were white, 94 percent were male, the average age of the victim was 30, 60 percent of the victims were intoxicated at the time they were jailed and two of three victims were in isolation. `` While black inmates comprise 41 percent of the jail population, they acounted for only 16 percent of the jail suicides,'' the study said. `` While 31 percent of jail inmates are intoxicated by alcohol upon arrest, over 60 percent of jail suicide victims were intoxicated upon arrest.'' Only <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> recorded no jail suicides in the two-year period.

 The Israeli-appointed Arab mayor of this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town was stabbed in the heart outside his office Tuesday in an apparent assassination attempt by Palestinian militants. The attack on <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>, 74, came as leaders of the Arab uprising issued a new list of directives, including renewed demands that all Israeli-appointed Arab officials resign. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Ramallah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> was in serious but stable condition after surgery. He was stabbed once with a `` very long knife'' that pierced his heart, diaphragm, liver and stomach, a doctor said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The PLO-led <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> of the Uprising demanded in a new leaflet that all Israeli-appointed mayors and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> employees of the military government step down. It called for protests and a general strike Thursday in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Since the rebellion began Dec. 8, 201 Palestinians have been killed and more than 5,000 injured. Two Israelis have died. Israeli Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON>, who visited <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Bireh </PERSON> after the attack, said he hoped the stabbing would not lead to resignations. Israeli-appointed mayors serve in about a dozen <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns and cities. Heads of about 85 village councils also are appointed by the military government. The municipalities and village councils provide local services to the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> population and serve as a buffer and mediator between the residents and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military authorities. If appointed officials quit, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials replacing them would find it even more difficult to gain Palestinian cooperation. <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> said police had no immediate leads, but he believed the assailants had a `` nationalistic motive,'' meaning they were Palestinian nationalists. <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Taher </PERSON>, an Arab member of the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bireh </ORGANIZATION> city council, blamed the attack on Palestinian militants and added: `` I had hoped we would not descend to the level of assassination.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported military officials met with several appointed <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> leaders in an effort to persuade them not to resign. A senior military government official confirmed a meeting took place but would not elaborate. The appointed mayors of <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> refused comment when asked if they would step down. The attacker or attackers ambushed <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> at about 11:30 a.m. as he left the town hall, <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> told reporters. He said <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> was not with his bodyguard. Minutes after the stabbing, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON> saw <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> slumped against a storefront, surrounded by soldiers. His face was ashen and a large bloody wound was visible in his left chest, partially covered by a bandage. <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON> said four soldiers commandeered a passing car and took <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The army clamped a curfew on <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION>, a city of 10,000 about nine miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Hundreds of soldiers patrolled the city and would n't let reporters enter. <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mahdeyah </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview that her husband had been threatened repeatedly before the stabbing. She said twice the family house had been attacked with stones and twice with firebombs. `` My kids and I always urged him to resign, but he felt he was serving his people,'' <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>'s wife said. <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> was named to his post in September 1986 along with the mayors of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> in an effort by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to gain cooperation from <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> moderates. The Arab mayors replaced Israeli officials. The appointments came six months after Palestinian militants assassinated the Israeli-appointed <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> mayor, <PERSON> Zafer </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Masri </PERSON>. Palestinians expressed mixed feelings after Tuesday's stabbing. `` He should have stood by his people, but instead he listened to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. `` I hope we'll hear about the rest -LRB- of the appointed mayors -RRB- soon.'' Arab militants have complained that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s appointment of mayors was a scheme to replace the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership in the occupied territories with Jordanian-backed moderates. <PERSON> Farah </PERSON> <PERSON> Araj </PERSON>, the elected mayor of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jallah </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, condemned the attack. `` We tried assassinations in the 1930s and 1940s, and it did n't work, but instead made things worse and divided the Arab community,'' he said. Also Tuesday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> sharply rejected a request to free <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> until the Arab-American is to be deported Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last Sunday upheld a government deportation order issued last month against <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, who advocates non-violent resistance to the Israeli occupation. The radio said <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to release him from jail and place him under house arrest until his deportation as a good-will gesture. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Tzahi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanegbi </PERSON> wrote Gal that <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s release from jail could lead to violent disturbances, the radio said.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Flint </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, developer of a worldwide agricultural research network which has increased the availability of food for billions of people, was named Tuesday to receive the $ 200,000 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prize </ORGANIZATION>. `` This was a total surprise to me,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said of the award given to recognize outstanding achievement in improving the quantity, quality or availability of food on a significant world scale. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, who will celebrate his 81st birthday on June 22, told a news conference that world governments must `` support and strengthen ... the connection between the research worker, the extension worker -LRB- in the field -RRB- and the farmer'' to increase world food production. `` We must meet the farmer where he is,'' he said, noting that `` the farmer is not very often the limiting factor'' in the success of agricultural programs in foreign lands. Instead, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said, `` it's the extension agent who wants to make sure it's the right thing he's recommending or government officials who are n't ready to support -LRB- new agricultural -RRB- innovations.'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, who was chosen from a field of 125 nominees from 39 nations, will receive his cash award and an original sculpture by <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> during a ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 4. The prize, first awarded in 1987, is funded by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit arm of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ryebrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. As the founding director of the Philippines-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> IRRI </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> oversaw the development of high-yielding varieties of rice in the 1950s and 1960s that helped form the basis for the green revolution in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> `` The single most important thing I did was to help establish <ORGANIZATION> IRRI </ORGANIZATION>, to hire competent scientists, to stimulate them, lead them into productivity along practical lines of getting increased food production and not having them go off theoretical lines,'' he said. The research developments at <ORGANIZATION> IRRI </ORGANIZATION> are credited with averting a major famine in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> in the 1970s. The center became the institutional model for 12 other agricultural stations around the world. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> native who now lives in <LOCATION> Raymond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, served as president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> from 1947 to 1954 before turning to full-time agricultural research.

 The principal critic of House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s ethics said Tuesday that he too has used a member of his congressional staff to work on a book he was writing prior to its publication. Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., who asked the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee last month to investigate <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, said he is `` fairly confident'' that he asked then-administrative assistant <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorsky </PERSON> to review his book, `` Window of Opportunity,'' before it was published in 1984 `` There is clearly a distinction between -LRB- using staff on -RRB- legitimate public policy efforts, which may include books and speeches, which I suspect virtually every member of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` We all ask our staffs to critique it, to look at it, to make sure it's all right.'' <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>, a former aide to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, said in interviews this week that he spent 150 to 200 hours while on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat's staff working on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' House records show that Cossolotto also was paid $ 2,078 from official congressional accounts to cover his expenses during a 1984 trip to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> when he oversaw the final editing of the book. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has refused to comment on the matter since Sunday, when he defended Cossolotto's assignment during a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. He canceled his regular daily news briefing Tuesday and denied an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> request for an interview on the subject. Cossolotto's role in the production of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book did not become public until after <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> asked for the ethics committee investigation into <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s personal financial dealings. But the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> congressman said Tuesday he thinks the ethics panel also should examine whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules by assigning Cossolotto to work on the book. `` The idea of using 200 hours, of having it be your only job assignment, of charging over $ 2,000 for a trip which a staffer says was only for the purpose of going to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> in order to write the book, it seems to me that's clearly wrong,'' he said. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gregorsky </PERSON>'s only role in his own book was reviewing the manuscript before it was published. He said he wrote the first draft himself and the final draft was done with help from his wife and a professional writer who was paid by the publisher. In a related development, aides said Tuesday that <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> has begun using his role in the ethics campaign against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to raise money for <ORGANIZATION> GOPAC </ORGANIZATION>, a political action committee that supports conservative candidates for state offices. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who is general chairman of <ORGANIZATION> GOPAC </ORGANIZATION>, sent a fund-raising letter June 1 seeking $ 75 contributions `` to help us keep the heat on the Democrats and make the gains we need this November.'' The letter also included a postcard for recipients to send to Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, urging the panel to launch an investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book was the subject of part of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s complaint to the ethics committee. He asked the panel to investigate reports that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was receiving unusually high royalties of 55 percent for the book, which was published by a company which received more than $ 250,000 for services to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s re-election campaign in 1985-86. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, whose company published the book, said Tuesday that it had a press run of 20,000 and is sold out. He said most copies were sold directly by his company for $ 5.95 each, with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> receiving $ 3.25 and the company $ 2.70. Some copies of the book, however, were sold to bookstores for $ 3, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said, and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received only $ 1 per book royalties on those. In the interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> responded to reports that lobbyists had purchased multiple copies of the book by saying he would be glad to have <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> provide a list of the purchasers. But <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he had no such list available, although he speculated that `` very few'' were sold to bookstores. `` If I had to guess how many we sold to bookstores, I'd say between 2,000 and 3,000,'' he said. `` Why take in $ 3 when I can take in $ 5.95?''

 Three conservatives filed a complaint Tuesday against independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, saying the Iran-Contra prosecutor may have violated federal criminal law when he accepted free legal services from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tribe </PERSON>. Tribe, at <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s behest, wrote a brief in support of another independent counsel, <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, who is seeking to have the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reverse a federal appeals court decision which declared that independent counsels are unconstitutional. The criminal complaint filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division says <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> may have violated the Anti-Deficiency Act, which makes it unlawful for a government employee to accept voluntary services from private individuals <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said his office had researched the question and concluded there was no violation, and that his office was checking with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the matter. The complaint was filed by three men, including <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Messing </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Messing is a conservative activist who worked with fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> in attempts to aid the Contras. The complaint asks the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to look into the free services of Tribe and calls for appointment of an independent counsel to conduct a criminal investigation. The maximum penalty for violating the Anti-Deficiency Act is two years imprisonment and a $ 5,000 fine. The others filing the complaint were <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehm </PERSON>, treasurer of the Conservative Campaign Fund, and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, chairman of Citizens for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` We have carefully researched this issue and are satsified that there is no violation whatever of the Anti-Deficiency Act,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in a statement. `` We have communicated this conclusion to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which has expressed no disagreement and has sought the views of its office of legal counsel,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> added. The Citizens for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> group issued a statement quoting <PERSON> Boehm </PERSON> as saying `` <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has sought to privatize our judicial process.'' <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON> said that `` one must question the financial arrangements'' in which <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is allowing senior staff lawyers to retain their relationships with private law firms. <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON> said this has created `` the potential for huge conflicts of interest.'' A spokesman for <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieghart </PERSON>, said a special panel screens potential conflicts of interest and that `` we're aware of none.'' <PERSON> Wieghart </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> tried to get the most qualified lawyers possible for his investigation and acknowledged that some have come to work on a part-time basis.

 A federal judge Tuesday ordered the government to grant visas to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s interior minister and three others barred from entering the country because of their membership in communist or communist-affiliated groups. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, reversing an earlier finding that had been set aside by a federal appeals court, ruled that Nicaraguan Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON>, two Cuban officials and a former Italian senator should be admitted to accept speaking engagements at the invitation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> held that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had violated the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act by denying the four visas simply because the applicants were members of communist or communist-affiliated organizations. The law authorizes the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to exclude aliens if a consular official determines they would engage in activities during a visit that `` would be prejudicial to the public interest'' or endanger the safety of citizens. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had invoked the 1952 law saying that visits by <PERSON> Borge </PERSON>, former Italian senator <PERSON> Nino </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasti </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials <PERSON> Leonor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lezcano </PERSON> and <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Finlay </PERSON> would be prejudicial to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests. <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> had been invited in 1983 to speak by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, university professors and religious leaders, but the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said his presence in the country would be `` highly prejudicial to the foreign policy interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' To keep <PERSON> Pasti </PERSON> out, the government cited his membership in the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a group it considered controlled by the Soviet government, and said his speech to a nuclear disarmament rally on <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> would merely advance Soviet interests. The two <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> women had been delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Statute of Women and were invited by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to attend a conference on the subject. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> argued that to bar someone, the law requires the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to determine that an alien's proposed activities during the visit _ as opposed to political affiliations _ would endanger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> originally sided with the government's application of the law, but a divided panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here reversed his 1984 ruling. The appellate court finding was upheld last fall on a 3-3 vote by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which did not issue an opinion. The appellate panel ordered <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> to determine if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had acquiesced to a longstanding <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> practice of refusing visas to individuals simply because their mere presence in the country would hurt national interests. `` In the opinion of this court, the government has failed in this task,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said in Tuesday's ruling. `` The court finds that the evidence of administrative acquiesence is only imperceptibly more weighty than it was when these cases were before the court in 1984.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> lawyer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who worked on the case, said <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s ruling means `` you ca n't penalize individuals for their associational activities, for their expression and for their ideology.'' `` We believe the statute looked to conduct,'' he said.

 Two Soviet cosmonauts and a Bulgarian rocketed into space Tuesday on the first manned flight of 1988, riding a column of orange flame on live television, courtesy of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and `` glasnost.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON>, 36, from the Bulgarian town of <LOCATION> Omurtag </LOCATION>, had waited more than nine years for the flight. The Soyuz TM-5 space capsule lifted off at 6:03 p.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time -LRB- 10:03 a.m. EDT -RRB- from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The broadcast on state television showed flames spewing from a Vostok rocket booster to lift the capsule into a nearly cloudless blue sky. `` I feel excellent,'' <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON> said from inside the capsule seconds after the launch. The shot, in black and white, showed him in cramped quarters. About two minutes into the flight, the first stage of the booster dropped away and plummeted toward the earth. Before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became the Soviet leader, with his `` glasnost'' policy of openness in selected areas, launches customarily were broadcast only when successful and only on tape, after the fact. Tuesday's live coverage lasted more than an hour, and other media also featured the story. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> carrried 10 reports on the launch and the Soviet manned space program. The Soviet program thrives, while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manned flights stalled after January 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, which killed seven astronauts. Several other Soviet manned missions are planned for this year, including crew members from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. During the broadcast Tuesday, <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON>'s family was shown in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> watching the launch on a television screen set up on a street. `` I wish him a happy journey and a safe return, like any mother,'' his mother told a television reporter minutes after the launch. The broadcast showed cheering, waving crowds in the streets. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s defense minister was among the dignitaries watching at Baikonur in the republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON> and cosmonauts <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Savinykh </PERSON>, 48, and <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON>, 40, are scheduled to dock Thursday with the space station Mir, whose name means Peace in Russian. Already aboard are cosmonauts <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON>, the last men to enter space. They reached the station Dec. 23. In a 10-day mission, the five men are to conduct about 40 experiments, some using Bulgarian equipment. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said they involve space physics, remote sensing of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, space biology and medicine. Among items the new cosmonauts are taking to the Mir is an orchid grown on Earth from seeds planted on the space station, the agency said. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Svirin </PERSON>, a shift director at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, told reporters the Mir's amenities include a a videocassette recorder with which the cosmonauts can watch movies The last Bulgarian-Soviet flight, in April 1979, was marred by a failed attempt to dock with the Salyut space station. The Bulgarian cosmonaut on that flight, <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, told Soviet television this time he had one wish for <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON>: that he only hear the word `` normal'' during his mission. <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> got his wish. <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said repeatedly that all systems on the Soyuz TM-5 were operating normally. <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON> was the backup Bulgarian for the 1979 mission. He had trained for this flight since last year.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said Tuesday more than 34,000 Soviet soldiers _ about 30 percent of the total _ have been withdrawn but the pace may be slowed if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> continues arming Afghan insurgents. `` If the Pakistani side does not ... end interference in the internal affairs of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> from its territory, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> reserves its right to react to this in a manner warranted,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who uses only one name, said in a speech to a special <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session on disarmament. He did not elaborate in the speech, but told a news conference later: `` We want to visualize an optimistic situation ... but should such violations acquire a permanent character ... in such a case we would certainly renew our consideration on the schedule of withdrawal and take proper reactions, together with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> added, however, that his government intends to meet the troop withdrawal schedule set by the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which requires all Soviet soldiers to be out within nine months of May 15. In his first speech to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, delivered in the <LOCATION> Dari </LOCATION> language, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> accused Pakistani authorities and Afghan guerrillas of hindering the voluntary return of Afghan refugees to their homeland. `` Such actions are sheer violations of the letter and spirit of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords and an affront to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` They in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> will be gravely mistaken should they think that only one part of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords, the return of the Soviet troops, will be implemented and the other parties will not live up to their commitments,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said. About 5.5 million people, roughly one-third of the population, have fled <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 10 years of civil war _ more than 3 million to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and 2 million to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> requires the Soviets to withdraw the more than 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers who have been helping fight Moslem rebels in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Soviet officials also have threatened to slow the withdrawal. In a statement May 28 announcing that 10,000 soldiers had left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the pullout could slow if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> kept delivering `` lavish supplies'' to the rebels. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> disarmament session for 30 minutes, devoting most of his remarks to the situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He again called for national reconciliation and establishment of a coalition government, including opposition forces. He said the death toll in the war was 243,900 soldiers and civilians, including 35,700 women and 20,700 children. He said 77,700 people have been wounded. Moslem guerrillas began fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after a Communist coup in April 1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in December 1979. The insurgents were not involved in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiations. Leaders of the seven-party guerrilla coalition have said they would ignore the agreement and continue fighting.

<TEXT>
 About 2,400 tons of toxic waste from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> have been dumped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, maritime authorities revealed Tuesday. The poisonous chemicals were shipped to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in containers and barrels to be dumped in the Kesrouan coastal strip, about 20 miles north of the capital city of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the authorities said. Some of the waste material was left in barrels in the <LOCATION> Kesrouan </LOCATION> area, authorities said. Some reports say part of the shipment was buried in that region. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Farhat </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters investigations were under way to determine how the chemicals entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> TV station, said Monday a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> importer, identified only as <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>, concluded an agreement with an Italian chemical firm for bringing the waste into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s telecommunications authority intercepted a message from the importer to his Italian agent demanding $ 500,000 for his services. Interior Minister <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Rassi </PERSON> said the waste was being examined to see if it was radioactive. The reports came as the Syrian freighter <LOCATION> Zanooria </LOCATION> was docked in <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, waiting to unload more than 2,000 tons of unidentified industrial waste that first sailed from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> last year.

<HEAD>Snow Falls In West; Storm Rips Through Delaware</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Snow fell in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and northwest <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Tuesday, and a severe storm demolished trailers, downed trees and caused power outages in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, while much of the rest of the nation had another hot day. At elevations as low as 3,500 feet in the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shasta </LOCATION> area and 5,000 feet in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> areas along the <LOCATION> California-Nevada </LOCATION> border, up to 5 inches of snow fell, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Most of the roads were free of snow, but the weather service expected some of the snow to stick to the roads later Tuesday, especially above 7,000 feet. In the lower elevations, rain was scattered. By contrast, record high temperatures were set near the Canadian border from eastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Sunshine prevailed across most of the nation, but showers and thunderstorms reached from western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Showers and thunderstorms were widespread over <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and reached into parts of the central <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> region. A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect Tuesday evening for parts of southern and eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, much of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, as well as for much of northern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. A severe storm ripped through part of southern <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Tuesday between 4 p.m. and 5:30 p.m., before heading out to the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The storm caused injuries and demolished trailers as well as knocking trees onto power lines, authorities said. The heaviest damage appeared to be in the <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> areas, just north of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, where residents said they saw a tornado. Continued dry weather led officials from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> to place limits on water use, and left farmers wondering when rain would fall. A band of cool temperatures extended across extreme northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, much of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Afternoon readings in these areas were mostly in the 60s and lower 70s. The weather service said some patchy frost may occur Tuesday and Wednesday nights in some of the higher mountain valleys of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Record high temperatures for the date were set in <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, 96; <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, 95; <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, 93; <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, 100; <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, 93; <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, 90; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, 93; <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, 100; <LOCATION> Williston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, 102; <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, 96; <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 88.

The nation's low Tuesday morning was 28 degrees at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Truckee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The weather service predicted scattered showers and thunderstorms Wednesday reaching from southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and southeast <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states and the eastern parts of the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>.

 Instructors could have known about a recruit's fear of the water and his counseling before they allegedly forced him back into the water and he died, according to evidence introduced Tuesday. The evidence consisted of records that include a counseling sheet filled out Feb. 3 when <PERSON> Airman </PERSON> <PERSON> Recruit </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> tried to drop out. He died March 2 at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> wrote that he had a bad experience in the water as a child, an apparent reference to his near drowning at age 5 when his brother threw him into the water and then rescued him. `` I do n't want to go through that again,'' <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> wrote. `` I believe being a rescue swimmer is a great job, but not for me.'' The evidence was produced during a hearing to determine whether five rescue-swimmer school instructors and their commanding officer should face court-martial in the death of the 19-year-old recruit from <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. Testimony ended late Tuesday afternoon, and closing arguments were scheduled Wednesday Other records show that <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> had been placed on hold for a psychological follow-up examination Feb. 4. Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, student control chief at the school, testified the records were on file and that instructors and the officer-in-charge, Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, had access to them. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> is charged with dereliction of duty. The instructors are charged with involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery. They are Petty Officers 1st Class <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and Petty Officers 2nd Class <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelenock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>. Earlier testimony indicated a flight surgeon had declared <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> medically unfit for the course a month before he died because he was suffering from a phobia of being pulled under water. He was sent back to the school after a clinical psychologist disagreed with the diagnosis. On the day he died, <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> scrambled from the pool and said he wanted to quit the course. This was during an exercise in which instructors, acting the part of victims about to drown, grabbed students in headlocks from which they were supposed to extricate themselves and save the victims. Testimony indicates <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was forced back into the pool, then was pried away from a rope in the water and taken to the deep end where he collapsed. A pathologist testified Monday that <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> literally was scared to death because of his phobia, which triggered heart failure and drowning. Other evidence introduced Tuesday included a statement by Petty Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilinsky </PERSON>, an instructor-in-training, that defendant <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> had <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> in a headlock when the recruit passed out. `` I'm not going to say it's incorrect,'' <PERSON> Bilinsky </PERSON> said, although earlier in his testimony he said he had trouble remembering exactly what happened. At a news conference Tuesday in <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Wis., accused the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> of `` stonewalling'' in the investigation of <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death and called upon the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to release key reports on the case <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said he will seek to amend an appropriations bill next week, calling for a study on how the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> can revamp its training to improve safety.

The draft would replace guidelines issued more than a decade ago, which have become `` badly outdated'' due to changes in federal law, developments in case law and changes in economic thinking, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rule </PERSON>, assistant attorney general for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust division. The 1977 guidelines were `` very restrictive and hostile'' to intellectual property licensing agreements, said Rule. Under the new guidelines, such agreements wo n't be challenged unless it is found they will drastically raise prices to consumers or unduly restrict output. The 1977 guidelines provided an `` ill-defined analysis'' for what types of joint ventures were permitted, said Rule, who contended that the proposal provides a `` structured approach.'' A summary of the draft guidelines says that joint research and development, technology licensing restrictions and vertical non-price distribution arrangements `` often are not anti-competitive, and often substantially benefit <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. consumers.'' `` The most important thing the new guidelines do is provide certainty and clarity in the law, which reduces the cost of international transactions and increases the competitve ability of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms and ultimately enhances the welfare of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers,'' Rule said. The proposed guidelines contain 17 hypothetical cases of ways in which the new policies would apply. The new guidelines say the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top enforcement priority in the antitrust area internationally remains the prosecution of `` naked'' cartel arrangements among competitors engaging in price-fixing and bid-rigging agreements.

 A car bomb exploded Tuesday near a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> military checkpoint in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and touched off fighting between <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> troops and pro-Iranian militiamen, police said. At least six people were killed. The blast in the seaside district of <LOCATION> Ouzai </LOCATION> killed four people and wounded 39, including two Syrian soldiers and two Lebanese policemen, police said. Two more people died and another was injured in the gunfight. The explosion occurred at 4:05 p.m. about 100 yards from an office of the Iranian-backed fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. It was the third car bombing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. A gray <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> loaded with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunmen raced to the scene after the explosion, but dozens of Syrian soldiers and Lebanese policemen surrounding the site stopped the car and ordered its occupants out, police said. The Syrians and Lebanese were manning a nearby Syrian military checkpoint. `` When the gunmen refused to step out, troops and policemen tried to haul them out by force. One gunman fired his pistol, and a shoot-out erupted in which two gunmen were killed and a civilian passer-by was wounded,'' said a police spokesman. He spoke on condition of anonymity, in keeping with regulations. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> deployed about 2,400 troops in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> last month to quell fighting between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the rival pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia for control of the area. Most of the 18 foreigners kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed held in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. One of the slain gunmen was identified as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Assaf </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> official. Reporters and photographers watching from a distance saw troops and policemen beating the gunmen with rifle butts through the car's open windows before the shooting began One gunman was seen drawing a pistol and firing at the officers, who opened fire with submachine guns. Panicked onlookers fled. The brown Datsun, loaded with 33 pounds of explosives, was parked outside an automobile repair shop. The shop owner, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Jammal </PERSON>, who was wounded in the blast, told police the young man who left the car told him he wanted its radiator repaired and he would be back to pick it up. `` The man walked away. Minutes afterwards, the car exploded and I saw blood all over me. I looked around for the man, but there was no trace of him,'' <PERSON> Jammal </PERSON> said as policemen helped him into an ambulance. The wail of sirens resounded across the city as victims were rushed to hospitals. Fire engines doused two burning cars with water hoses. Debris from four damaged shops was quickly removed by Syrian soldiers and Lebanese policemen. So were at least six other wrecked cars. The bombing came eight days after a car bomb detonated in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rmaeil </LOCATION> residential neighborhood, killing 20 people and wounding 78. That blast raised fears that <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslems and Christians have launched a new round of car bombings. The first car bomb in 1988 blew up April 23 in a packed vegetable market in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s predominantly Sunni Moslem port city of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, killing 69 people and wounding 111. There was no claim of responsibility for any of the three bombings. But <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> leaders blamed the explosion in their city on the Lebanese Forces Christian militia. The Lebanese Forces command denied resonsibility. It accused the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> secret service of masterminding the Rmaeil car bombing. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Tuesday quoted <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> and Sunni Moslem sources in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as saying that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have initiated direct contacts with the Iranians in an effort to free foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. There are nine Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Two <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers, An-Nahar and As-Safir, published a letter in Arabic to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> on Tuesday, the third birthday of his daughter <PERSON> Sulome </PERSON>, whom he has never seen. `` Her only wish is to see you and be with you,'' Sulome's mother, <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON>, said in the letter. `` She knows that ... you want to be with her, but that you ca n't do that yet.''

 Two spectators at a court hearing on conditions at a federal prison in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> were held Tuesday on charges they assaulted a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal. The two men, believed to be supporters of a prisoner who testified at the hearing, were arrested after they scuffled with a deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal outside the courtroom of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, according to federal law enforcement authorities. The incident occurred while <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> was conducting a hearing on a lawsuit challenging conditions at a high-security isolation unit for a half-dozen women prisoners at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> had heard testimony about prison conditions from prisoner <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, identified by law enforcement officials as a left-wing terrorist who is serving a 58-year prison term for possessing 600 pounds of weapons and explosives Ms. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> is among seven people recently indicted for placing a bomb that exploded in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol in 1983. One of the two men in police custody following the hallway scuffle had refused to stand up when the judge returned from an afternoon recess, said authorities. When asked by <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> why he had not stood up, the man said he did not respect the authority of the court. Authorities said Deputy U.S. Marshal <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON> was jumped from behind while escorting the man down a hallway outside <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s courtroom <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON> was then punched by the man he was escorting before he and other courthouse guards subdued his attackers, authorities said. The two men, identified only as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heild </PERSON> and <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardlaw </PERSON>, were being held in the city police lockup Tuesday night on charges they assaulted a marshal, said authorities, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Ms. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> and two other inmates, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraldini </PERSON>, charge in the lawsuit brought by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> that they are being held in the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> isolation unit because of their political beliefs. <PERSON> Baraldini </PERSON> was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy in aiding a bungled $ 1.6 million robbery of a Brink's armored car in <LOCATION> Nyack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, that left a guard and two police officers dead in 1981. At the unit in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, guards escort the prisoners to and from the locked cellblock. Prisoners' hands and feet are shackled every time they leave the unit, Ms. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, who was in the general populations of two other federal prisons, said authorities told her she was placed in the unit in October, 1986 because she was considered a terrorist. `` They said I had a one-way ticket,'' she told <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. `` The isolation and the control and the dependency has taken away any semblance of any kind of self-determination about my life,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. `` Nobody should have that happen to them, no matter what they've been convicted of. That's punishment on punishment.'' `` I really think that in prison you ca n't control all aspects of your life,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. `` But when you ca n't control anything at any level, that's out of your hands, the frustration is really unbearable.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said the isolation and strict control by guards has inflicted severe emotional and psychological stress. `` Trying to suppress the anger asks an enormous amount of energy, an enormous amount of self-control and it's making me sick,'' she said. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, a psychiatrist hired by the government to inspect the prison, testified that he found no evidence that conditions had caused any unusual emotional or psychological damage. But <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said his findings were based only on observations and conversations with prison doctors because the prisoners refused to talk to him. Federal authorities contend that the extra security is required to protect the facility from terrorist attack. They said they plan to move the unit to a prison in <LOCATION> Mariana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in July. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>, in a 1987 letter to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, denied that inmates are sent to the unit because of political beliefs. But affiliation with groups that use violence in `` attempts to disrupt or overthrow the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or whose published ideology includes advocating law violations in order to ` free' prisoners is a factor,'' he said. Last weekend, <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> `` Squeaky'' <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON>, convicted of trying to shoot President Ford on Sept 5, 1975 in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was transferred to the unit last weekend, authorities said.

 A man went on a rampage Tuesday in a road grader and badly damaged at least three planes at the airport here before he was shot by police and sheriff's deputies, authorities said. The man, identified as <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> LaComb </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, was shot several times below the waist, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernardino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. No other injuries were reported. <PERSON> LaComb </PERSON>, 37, was airlifted to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> where he was listed in stable condition, <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. Authorities said he was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. Police and sheriff's deputies on the ground and a sheriff's deputy in a helicopter opened fire on the man after he ran into the side of Flight Craft, a business that gives flight lessons and refuels planes at the airport <LOCATION> Chino </LOCATION> is located about 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> LaComb </PERSON> is a construction worker in the area and had access to the grader, but he took it out of the authorized area on his day off, another sheriff's spokesman said. The chase began in the <LOCATION> Chino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> area, about six miles west of the airport, after the sheriff's station received a complaint at 9:41 a.m. that someone was operating a road grader in an erratic manner, <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. Chino police detectives began chasing the grader during the 29-minute drive to the airport, during which several people were nearly hit, he said. During the five-minute rampage at the airport, <PERSON> LaComb </PERSON> reportedly struck three small airplanes and barely missed several people on the ground. The chase ended when the grader's front end was jammed into Flight Craft's hangar. Police officers and sheriff's deputies opened fire on the man when he attempted to drive away from the hangar, <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>, who said he was in Flight Craft's hangar at <LOCATION> Chino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> when the incident occurred, estimated that <PERSON> LaComb </PERSON> came within 50 yards of hitting the business's fuel tanks. `` It almost looked like the guy in there was laughing,'' <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> said. `` He sure looked happy.''

<HEAD>Soviet Journal Criticizes Lenin For Harsh Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet literary journal has taken a new look at <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, saying the country's founder tried to enforce tough economic policies by ordering executions and other tough measures that backfired. In a 30-page article in the May edition of Novy Mir -LRB- New World -RRB-, <PERSON> Vassily </PERSON> <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON>, takes a more realistic look at <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s policies than the Lenin-can-do-no-wrong approach that has dominated official Soviet news media for years. <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON> said that in the first few years after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> favored extremely harsh measures for putting the economy on track. `` The extremes of force, as we see, spread boundlessly: first it is undertaken for repression of opponents of the revolution, then it is turned against potential enemies -LRB- the Red Terror -RRB- and finally, it becomes a means for solving purely economic tasks,'' <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON> wrote. Selyunin seemed to imply <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> laid the seeds for the abuses of power for which his successor, <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, has been condemned. Under Kremlin leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, historians are being encouraged to take a more honest look at the country's past. The result has been numerous press articles, books and films blasting <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who was responsible for the deaths of millions. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s economic policies, under which the central government tightly controlled production and allowed little individual initiative. The criticism extended to the `` era of stagnation'' under <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who ruled the country from the early 1960s to 1982. But criticism of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> has been off-limits. The Novy Mir article says <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> was mistaken when he abolished all private property and created a system of forced labor camps. <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> started to go astray in November 1917, when he declared that `` speculators'' were `` enemies of the people'' who should be shot when found, according to <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON>. Speculation meant anything outside government trade. <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> also advocated another harsh measure, limiting peasant families to only the bread they needed to make it to the next harvest, <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON> wrote. The penalty for violation was a minimum 10-year jail term. The author says <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> might be excused for some of the measures because the country was suffering severe hunger and destruction. But, <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON> wrote, the harsh measures actually made the problems worse. In January 1918, <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> supported a decree that increased prison space so `` class enemies'' could be incarcerated. But <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> began to realize he was wrong, and <PERSON> Selyunin </PERSON> quotes him as saying the use of force was backfiring in that it was increasing civil unrest, according to the article. In March 1921, <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> made a midcourse correction and had a severe tax removed from peasants. Two months later he launched his New Economic Policy, which allowed greater freedom in agriculture, industry and trade. Selyunin credits this program with helping rid the country of bureaucracy, which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said is stifling some of his reforms.

 A jury on Tuesday rejected claims by eight former residents of Times Beach that dioxin in the oil sprayed on the town's streets had made them ill. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury said, after deliberating a day, there was no medical evidence to support the claims. The eight represented more than 180 plaintiffs in the 7-month-old trial. Times Beach, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community of 2,400, was disincorporated and abandoned five years ago because of dioxin contamination. The eight residents whose claims were decided Tuesday had been chosen by Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> as representatives of 184 original plaintiffs in a suit filed against four chemical companies over alleged damages. The suit was one of several filed by <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> residents against the companies. The test trial was designed to provide guidelines for attorneys on both sides so that future trials could be handled in as short a time as possible, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. Only two of four chemical companies remained as defendants in the case. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> Syntex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Syntex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agribusiness </ORGANIZATION> reportedly settled the case for $ 14 million to be divided among 1,230 claimants. The now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petrochemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were the remaining defendants. An attorney for the plaintiffs, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, said a decision on whether to appeal Tuesday's decision had not yet been made. He said he would ask the court to allow him to choose eight new plaintiffs from the original 184 who would more clearly exhibit the injuries and property losses he said <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> residents suffered from the contamination. But defense attorneys expressed confidence that none of the plaintiffs had illnesses that could be traced to dioxin. `` They can pick the eight worst _ seven or eight people from <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> who happen to have cancer _ and I'm confident that we'll be able to prove that it's in no way connected to dioxin,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Parryman </PERSON>, an attorney for Northeastern Pharmaceutical and Chemical <ORGANIZATION> Syntex </ORGANIZATION> and its predecessor, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> <PERSON> Taff </PERSON>, made a herbicide known as Agent Orange at a plant in <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Dioxin is a waste product of Agent Orange, which was used as a defoliate in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Syntex </ORGANIZATION> later transferred tanks purportedly containing the waste material to Northeastern Pharmaceutical. Northeastern made hexachlorophene for soaps and toothpaste at the <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION> site, with dioxin a waste product of that chemical as well. Attorneys for the plaintiffs said Northeastern passed the waste on to <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petrochemical </ORGANIZATION>, which passed it on to <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliss </PERSON>, the waste hauler who sprayed oil containing the dioxin on the streets in <LOCATION> Times </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> more than 15 years ago to keep the dust down. <PERSON> Bliss </PERSON> was not a defendant. The extent of the contamination in <LOCATION> Times </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> was determined in 1982, leading the government to close the city the next year and relocate its residents.

<TEXT>
 The space agency anticipates strong competition from prospective manufacturers of the next generation of shuttle rockets despite a decision by <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, the sole builder of current solid-fuel boosters, to pull out of the running, a spokesman said Tuesday. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> says it will concentrate on redesign, for short-term use, of the rocket booster used on Challenger, which exploded shortly after takeoff Jan. 28, 1986, killing all seven astronauts aboard. According to a presidential commission, the fiery disaster was caused by hot gas that leaked through a joint in a Thiokol-built solid-fuel booster, igniting the shuttle's main fuel tank. <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> may have pulled out of the competition for the $ 1.2 billion contract to design and build rocket boosters for the 1990s, but <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials believe other companies still will be interested. `` We're going ahead with this project. We do expect strong competition for the contract,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> _ the center that oversees the space agency's rocket work. `` Meanwhile, we look forward to our association with <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> on the current booster,'' <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans to use <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s redesigned motor when it resumes shuttle flights _ the first planned for late August. The redesign is nearly complete, with a test firing set for next month at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>, a team of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aerojet </ORGANIZATION> and another team consisting of <LOCATION> Hercules </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> have expressed an interest in the $ 1.2 billion contract. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Aerojet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday he was surprised by <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement to pull out, but said the news was good for <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s competitors. `` Any time your field of competitors lessens by one, your chances improve, obviously,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. `` And yes, we are interested. `` It's going to be a competitive contract,'' he added. `` -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is a very strong competitor. But as to who is the best competitor, it's a tough one to say.'' <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, meanwhile, said he could not speculate what impact <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement might have on the competition for the next-generation version of shuttle boosters _ the advanced solid rocket motor _ except to say the space agency plans on strong competition for the project. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans to release its formal request for final industry proposal for the advance rocket later this month, <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans to begin phasing in the advanced rocket in 1994 and that process is expected to take about four years, meaning <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> will still be involved in providing the current shuttle rockets for years, <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> plans to invest $ 200 million in coming years to modernize its northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> plant in order to seek other space and defense business, <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. The company, which makes and sells chemicals, rockets and salt, intends to go after the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> advanced launch system, a strap-on booster and other contracts, he said.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will hold his first meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Thursday, an Israeli spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Genine </PERSON> <PERSON> Stauber </PERSON> said no exact time and place for the meeting had been set. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> broke diplomatic relations after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war but appears to be departing from its policy of not restoring them until the Israelis give up <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> territories occupied in the war. <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has indicated in recent speeches that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> might resume normal relations after an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is convened. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> leads the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and opposes trading occupied territory for peace. He also rejects proposals for an international conference including the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Those two points are the basis of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, which Secretary of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has been promoting in the region. On Monday, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will not offer political concessions for resumption of diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> are in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to address the 159-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s special session on disarmament, which began last week and is to run until June 25. Their governments have had recent diplomatic contacts at lower levels. At Tuesday's disarmament session, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s neighbors to agree to ban nuclear and chemical weapons from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> but said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will not sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Many delegates from Arab and developing nations left the hall as <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> walked to the podium. `` As early as 1980, we proposed at the General Assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, based on free and direct negotiations between the states of the region. `` We did so in addition to our repeated declaration that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons into the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' he added. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to say if it has nuclear weapons or the components to assemble them. A former Israeli nuclear technician, <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON>, was sentenced to prison in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for providing photographs of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> nuclear facility to the Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The newspaper hired scientists who said the photographs showed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had the capacity to make nuclear weapons. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> does not allow international inspection of its nuclear plants, a requirement of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. `` Many have urged us to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. But we have seen that this treaty has, in no way, prevented wars between its signatories. ... We have repeatedly invited the Arab states to negotiate the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone, but they have rejected the idea. ... They have refused to negotiate with us.'' He condemned the use of chemical weapons and poison gas in the Iran-Iraq war, singling out <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> _ `` By its own admission, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has used this vicious means of indiscriminate killing in its war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It is a gross and blatant violation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Protocol, to which <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is a signatory.'' Delegates from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> walked out before <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> began speaking. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also called for the reduction of conventional forces in the region. He decried the introduction of medium-range missiles in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was one of about 25 presidents and prime ministers due to address the special session on disarmament, which opened last week and is expected to end June 25.

 Five days before <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wimbley </PERSON> was stabbed to death, she told police her boyfriend might kill her. The boyfriend, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Royal </PERSON>, 30, has been charged with second-degree murder in her killing May 25. He has yet to enter a plea. Teachers at Ms. <PERSON> Wimbley </PERSON>'s school in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION> say that despite five calls to police and visits to two offices, no one would take down a report on <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>'s threats against the 17-year-old. `` She wanted help that day,'' said <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Loring </PERSON>, assistant principal at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, an alternative school for students with behavioral or academic problems. `` She was angry and hurt enough that she made an attempt to be not just another abused female,'' <PERSON> Loring </PERSON> said. `` If this guy had been approached by a policeman, it might have made a difference.'' Police Chief <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Wimbley </PERSON> was a victim of the system. `` A report should have been made'' by police, he said. Detective <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buhrmaster </PERSON> said police will review communications tapes to determine who handled the calls. `` Somebody should have been able to help this girl,'' he said. <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> State Attorney <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> said her office will investigate. Ms. <PERSON> Wimbley </PERSON> had dated Royal for three years and in January they had a baby girl.

 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Tuesday accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of trying to nullify the treaties restoring Panamanian sovereignty over the Canal Zone by the year 2000. Panamanian Ambassador <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, speaking before the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s special session on disarmament, cited a `` gigantic campaign of aggression unleashed by the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> claimed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> prepared a plan to destabilize the Panamanian government and thus open a way to `` legally abrogate the -LRB- Canal -RRB- treaties.'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said the alleged plan was drafted April 8, 1986, but he did not reveal any details on how the Panamanian goverment was informed about its existence.

<HEAD>Slain DEA Agent Pleaded With Captors to End Beatings, Tapes Reveal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal drug agent pleaded with his Mexican abductors to stop beating him during interrogation before he was murdered, according to transcripts of tape recordings filed in federal court. Transcripts of two tapes obtained by Mexican authorites from the home of reputed drug kingpin Ernesto Fonseca-Carrillo were filed Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> as part of the prosecution of three of the nine men indicted in the murder of <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent, was kidnaped Feb. 7, 1985 as he left the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>. Several weeks later his body and that of his pilot, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala-Avelar </PERSON>, who was kidnapped separately, were found on a remote ranch 70 miles away. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> had been severely beaten. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was kidnapped shortly after he and other agents uncovered a drug trafficking operation run by <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro-Quintero </PERSON>, who along with <PERSON> Fonseca-Carrillo </PERSON> was one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s biggest drug kingpins. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> moans and complains of pains and injuries on the tapes. Federal prosecutors say they believe the recorder was turned off during beatings. The agent says at one point that he has `` sharp pains'' all over his body and asks his captors: `` Could n't I ask you to have my ribs bandaged, please?'' Affidavits about autopsy reports, which also were filed, state that <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s jaw was broken in several places and his head was shattered `` like an eggshell.'' According to documents filed in court, federal prosecutors believe that <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Espino-Verdin </PERSON>, a former Mexican police sergeant, interrogated <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> for two days at a large estate owned by Fonseca-Carrillo outside <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said the voices of Espino-Verdin and <PERSON> Caro-Quintero </PERSON> have been identified on the tape. The transcript reveals that <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> told his captors the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> knew the whereabouts of Fonseca-Carrillo and Caro-Quintero but that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> were not allowed to carry weapons and so did n't conduct surveillance of the two men. `` To conduct surveillance over there at the house, I have never, sir ... I am afraid,'' <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> said. `` I did not want trouble. I just wanted to get out of here,'' he said, referring to his transfer back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that was pending at the time. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> may have been attempting to mislead his abductors by asserting that agents do n't carry guns, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockridge </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Local commanders can authorize agents to carry weapons, he said. `` He was just throwing out something that was wrong,'' <PERSON> Lockridge </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> mentions confidential information at times, indicating that the tapes are authentic, according to affidavits of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents who worked with him. That information includes a reference to complaints about the <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> office from DEA headquarters. `` I'm telling you that we are being reprimanded from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> because, according to them, we are not working here,'' <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> says. `` As I say, well, who is going to do the work if they have one unarmed?'' <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> gave only skimpy information about <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> informants, causing the interrogator to snap: `` Who is it that put the finger on <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON>? Do n't tell me about your problems; speak of the information you can give us, you can provide us to finish with this bunch of jerks ...'' `` Yes, sir. What more can I tell you, sir?'' <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> says in a voice described in the transcript as `` very weak.'' Defense motions have challenged the validity of the tapes, saying they contain an unexplained burst of music and clicking sounds that suggest tampering or fabrication. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez-Alvarez </PERSON>, 28, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix-Gutierrez </PERSON>, 38, and <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo-Urquidez </PERSON>, 36, are scheduled to go on trial in <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> here later this month. All have denied involvement in the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> case. Caro-Quintero and Fonseca-Carrillo are in custody in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and extradition proceedings are stalled. The other indicted men are not in custody.

Buzzetta is president and majority stockholder in the Scrantonian Tribune of <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> and a partner, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scudder </PERSON>, acquired the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, the second-largest paper in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, in late 1986 for $ 110 million from <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

Two weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> agreed to drop lawsuits filed against each other concerning paid circulation figures.

 The White House AIDS commission gave its tentative endorsement Tuesday night to the bulk of the 579 recommendations the panel's chairman wants to put in a report to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> later this month. In releasing his recommendations last week, retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> portrayed most of them as reflecting what he read as the consensus of the 13-member committee. That turned out to be true during an 11-hour meeting as the commissioners worked through the report page-by-page, making only minor changes in wording and organization. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' had predicted correctly that his final chapter calling for legislation to vest sweeping new powers in the surgeon general _ currently Dr. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> _ would prove controversial. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should immediately proclaim AIDS a national emergency as soon as legislation is passed setting up a new framework within the government health bureaucracy to put the surgeon general in charge of dealing with it. Although the commission did not reject <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' suggestions outright, there was a sharp exchange of differences between the chairman and commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and it was clear <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> does not have the broad backing of the panel on his proposed shift of power to the surgeon general. The issue of what, if anything, to recommend in the way of administrative changes to deal with AIDS as well as future epidemics was left up in the air with the commissioners agreeing to submit their thoughts in writing for the panel's staff to synthesize and present for further consideration at the final working session next Thursday and Friday. The final report is due June 24 at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and it became clear after Tuesday's session that it will essentially track <PERSON> Watkin </PERSON>'s recommendations _ including his call for strong federal legislation to protect people with the AIDS virus from discrimination. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told fellow commissioners he has received letters from `` both sides of the aisle'' that leads him to believe `` there is a feeling of momentum in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' for passage of such legislation despite administration opposition. `` It is something that can be done in this session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` I do n't know that it will be.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> had expressed some concern about the anti-discrimination recommendation in early discussions, saying it `` would not be fruitful and would not be fair'' to make a specific recommendation about AIDS discrimination. `` If we're going to make it, we should expand it to cover not just AIDS, but all diseases,'' said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, the director of Project HOPE, a private international health delivery organization. However, other commissioners noted that the recommendation is for a law that spells out that people with the AIDS virus are to be treated just like people with any other handicapping disease _ no worse, no better. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the anti-discrimination recommendation should be the No. 1 priority in the final report's introductory chapter. Among the other <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> recommendations the panel agreed to emphasize at the forefront of the final report: _ That all of those infected with the AIDS virus _ an estimated 1.5 million Americans compared with fewer than 70,000 actually diagnosed with the full-blown illness _ should be considered part of the epidemic _ That intravenous drug abuse is a national emergency that must be successfully dealt with if the AIDS epidemic is to be curtailed _ That the fight against the disease will require resources of private as well as government resources _ That compassion for those with AIDS should be empasized at all levels Tuesday's marathon session was designed to reach as much consensus as possible. Any lingering differences over final wording will be resolved by votes, if necessary, at next week's sessions. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> assured panel members there would be ample time for debate, promising to run the planned Thursday-Friday session into the weekend if necessary. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users. As of June 6, AIDS had been diagnosed in 64,506 Americans, of whom more than half, or 36,255 have died since June 1981, according to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<HEAD>Court Orders Philadelphia To Free Hundreds From Crowded Jails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An appeals court reversed itself Tuesday and ordered <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to release hundreds of inmates from its overcrowded prisons within 24 hours. The district attorney's office predicted dire consequences, saying prosecution will slacken and criminals will grow bold knowing they face little chance of going to jail. `` You are going to have whole classes of people who ca n't be put in prison,'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandenbraak </PERSON>, an attorney representing the district attorney's office. `` Ninety-nine percent of the drug dealers we prosecute wo n't get in prison _ not even the major drug dealers.'' The order from the 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> forces the city to free prisoners awaiting trial by paying bail of up to $ 250 to reach a ceiling of 3,750 imates. As of Saturday, 4,059 were housed in the city's four jails. If a threat to exceed the cap exists, authorities also will be unable to imprison any criminals but those charged with the most serious crimes. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandenbraak </PERSON>, an attorney representing the district attorney's office, said the result will be the city footing the bill to put dangerous criminals back on the street. `` Once people realize they ca n't be put in prison, they're not going to put up the bail for themselves,'' Ms. <PERSON> Vandenbraak </PERSON> said. `` Do you think anybody in these categories is going to be putting up bail?'' The appeals court on Monday blocked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s order imposing the limit and the moratorium on prison admissions beginning at midnight. The order was based on a consent decree the city signed in 1986 and had agreed to fulfill a year ago. The decree resulted from a class-action lawsuit inmates filed in 1982 challenging prison conditions. The original stay was requested by District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON>, who said he needed time to prepare a formal appeal of <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s moratorium. After the three-member appeals court issued a one-sentence reversal Tuesday, Ms. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> modified her order, giving the city until 5 p.m. Wednesday to meet the cap and to restrict admissions. Ms. <PERSON> Vandenbraak </PERSON> said the city will not take further legal action until a hearing already scheduled on June 22.

 The Sandinista government and U.S.-backed rebels held daylong talks Tuesday on a government proposal for democratic reform in exchange for rebel disarmament. The fourth round of peace talks resumed Tuesday in a climate of mutual distrust, but both sides said they might be nearing agreement after more than six years of war. Information Minister <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> reported after the talks adjourned at 7 p.m. -LRB- 5 p.m. EDT -RRB- Tuesday until 9 a.m. Wednesday, `` We have made substantial advances.'' A representative of the leftist government, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said earlier that the government proposal bows to almost all the rebel demands for democratic reforms. The rebels, known as Contras, described the proposal as vague but said it raised hopes for an agreement. Contra negotiator <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said: `` The Nicaraguan Resistance is here with a political decision to sign a definite agreement for permanent and lasting peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if the government shows its political commitment to make the democratic reforms in this country to achieve that lasting peace.'' The Resistance is the Contras' umbrella organization. <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamatoros </PERSON>, spokesman for the rebels, told reporters after the meeting ended `` there were advances in the discussion on themes of a substantial character,'' but said political reform remained `` the biggest problem in the discussions.'' He charged that the government was `` using the dialogue to gain time. They have to demonstrate the opposite to us.'' The talks are taking place amid a temporary truce enacted March 21. The rebels have extended the truce until Thursday, and the government has declared a unilateral cease-fire until the end of June. Each side accuses the other of violations. The government proposal promises press freedom, the right to strike, electoral reforms, an end to Sandinista control of the army and freedom for political prisoners. The proposal offers the Contras a role in talks begun late last year with opposition political parties. The so-called national dialogue has made little headway. On April 26, the opposition parties suspended the talks pending settlement of a workers' strike. The scars and bitterness of the civil war were dramatized Tuesday in dramatic full-page ads by the <ORGANIZATION> Mothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heroes </ORGANIZATION> and Martyrs in the two pro-government newspapers. The committee is comprised of mothers whose children have died in the war. The ad in the Barricada newspaper showed pictures of wounded children along with rebel commander Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>. `` We do n't want amnesty for criminals,'' it said. The ad in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diario </LOCATION> showed women carrying a coffin, a child leaning on a cross and a bullet-riddled body. `` We wo n't forget,'' it said. `` Our pain calls for justice.'' The Sandinistas have called for disarmament of the rebels to be completed by September while the Contras have proposed January. The Contras say they will not lay down arms until the nation of 3 million people is a democracy. The Sandinistas say it already is. Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said Monday night the Contras should accept the Sandinista proposals because `` at best, within a month they will not have the capacity to negotiate more.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels ended on Feb. 26. Three weeks later, the rebels signed a temporary cease-fire and began talks on a permanent peace with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The Contras are also plagued by deep divisions within their ranks. The Sandinistas, who get military and economic aid from the Soviet bloc, also have compelling reasons for ending a war that has claimed 26,000 lives. The Nicaraguan economy is a shambles and the government faces widespread public dissatisfaction over chronic shortages and its failure to deliver on promises made when it took power in July 1979. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> expressed hope that the talks would be productive and that the Sandinistas would negotiate in good faith. `` The key issue is the Sandinistas' willingness to democratize,'' Ms. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` We're hopeful, but we note that in recent weeks the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have increased repression of the internal opposition.''

 Despite missing several weeks of school because of suspensions, three street preaching children were promoted to the next grade, their father said Tuesday. The Strode children, <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> and Pepper, were suspended numerous times because they refused to proceed into the <ORGANIZATION> Eastfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> building when they arrived on school property each morning. Instead, the three children began preaching. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, school officials have stressed that the suspensions resulted not from the preaching, but from failure to adhere to school rules. Their father, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview that <LOCATION> McDowell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school officials notified him Tuesday afternoon that his children had passed. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> will be in the first grade, Pepper moves to the second grade and <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> will go to the sixth grade. The children took comprehensive tests to complete the school year. School officials would not release the test results, nor would they say whether the children were promoted to their respective next grades. Strode, who is building a house in another school district, said the preaching will stop if the local schools end their teaching of the theory of evolution. `` We do n't think people who think <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> was a liar should be teaching our children in our schools, unless people have liberties the other way,'' he said. Meanwhile, residents of <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> are circulating a petition asking Strode to either keep his children from preaching in the schoolyard or to leave the town. `` If you're going to be a preacher, public opinion ca n't bother you,'' Strode said.

 A woman sentenced to jail for refusing to testify about her daughter's claim that she was the victim of a racist attack will seek sanctuary in a church and dare authorities to arrest her there, her lawyers said Tuesday. `` The question would be whether this government can respect the right of the black church, because if it can not we are prepared tomorrow and the day after that to put our lives on the line,'' said attorney <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` Before you put a hand on <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, you will come through me. Please have a bullet designated for me,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON>, 16, has said she was abducted and assaulted last November in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, 95 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, by six white men, including one who flashed a police-like badge. But she and her family have refused to cooperate with investigators, claiming local and state officials are engaged in a racially motivated cover-up. Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, 33, was sentenced to 30 days in jail Monday for defying a grand jury subpoena to testify, but upon the urging of state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> she was given one more chance _ an opportunity Wednesday to tell a judge why she had refused to cooperate. But <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> insisted at a news conference that Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> would not appear Wednesday. `` <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> will be seeking relief before a higher authority, she will be putting her life in God's hands,'' he said. Neither <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> nor others at the news conference would say what church would offer Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> asylum. They insisted authorities had no right to enter a church to arrest her. But Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the decision to arrest people who request sanctuary privileges is decided on a case-by-case basis. `` There's no hard and fast rule,'' he said. Police are allowed to arrest suspects who run into a church, the spokesman said. However, if the suspect requests refuge and is granted sanctuary by the pastor, police have to obtain a search warrant to make an arrest or negotiate with the parties involved, <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. Attorney <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> reiterated the theme of the <LOCATION> Brawleys </LOCATION> and their advisers _ `` It is clear we can not get justice for <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>.'' He said authorities had `` done everything possible to blame the victim even more. How ludicrous it is for the nation to see that the only person arrested in this case is the mother of a black rape victim. People should be outraged.'' Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was found Nov. 28, four days after she had disappeared. She was lying dazed in a plastic bag in a road in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. Her hair had been shorn, animal excrement had been smeared on her body and racial epithets had been scrawled on her torso. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said unless Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s family cooperates soon, the state's investigation into the incident will end without resolution.

 City authorities tried to head off a planned pro-democracy march by university students on Wednesday by warning that demonstrations without approval are illegal. They urged students to `` keep a sober mind.'' In front-page editorials, major official dailies accused some student leaders of being agitators trying to negate <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s reforms and appealed to students to avoid the `` methods of anarchy.'' The planned Wednesday afternoon march to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the symbolic political center of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, would be the first major political protest by students since the winter of 1986-1987. Nationwide student unrest then led to a conservative backlash against Western liberal ideas. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> was removed as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief for failing to stem the pro-democracy movement. The party purged several outspoken political thinkers. More than 1,000 students rallied from Tuesday night into early Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading university, to voice demands for greater democracy, more press freedom, better living conditions for intellectuals and better campus security. The turmoil was prompted by the June 2 slaying of a university student in an off-campus brawl. Six non-students were arrested in the death. The killing brought to the surface student unhappiness over poor living conditions on campus and bleak economic prospects after graduation for the nation's low-paid intellectuals. Hundreds have gathered on the campus in the evenings for impromptu debates on what broader lessons are to be learned from the incident. Dozens of posters have gone up demanding democracy, a free press, an end to government corruption and petty bureaucracy and greater respect and higher salaries for intellectuals. In an announcement Wednesday, the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> municipal government denounced a `` handful of people with ulterior motives who have taken the opportunity of this criminal case -LRB- the murder -RRB- to concoct rumors and slander the reform and open policy in violation of the law, and sabotaging political stability and unity.'' It reminded students that all demonstrations without previous approval from police are illegal. That regulation was imposed after the 1986-87 disturbances.

 <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>, sole manufacturer of solid-fuel space shuttle boosters blamed for the Challenger disaster, has dropped out of the competition for a $ 1.2 billion contract to make boosters for the 1990s. The Chicago-based company announced Monday that it wants to concentrate on redesigning the booster used on Challenger, whose fiery disintegration shortly after takeoff killed all seven astronauts aboard. A presidential commission blamed the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion on a plume of hot gas that leaked through a joint in a Thiokol-built solid-fuel booster, igniting the main fuel tank. The motor redesign is almost complete, with a test firing set for next month at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, a company spokesman in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> plant was the sole manufacturer of shuttle boosters, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admininistration </ORGANIZATION> must look elsewhere for producers of the next-generation version, the advanced solid rocket motor.

 The nation's 17-year-old students are dismal at math, with only half able to cope with problems usually taught in junior high school, a testing agency reported today. The federally sponsored <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> also said that nearly 27 percent of 13-year-olds are lacking in basic computational skills. More than a quarter of the 17-year-olds reported that they did not usually understand what was talked about in mathematics class, and only 6 percent could solve problems that took several steps or involved algebra or geometry. The agency reported the results of tests it gave nearly 15,000 students ages 9, 13 and 17 in 1985-86, as well as comparative data from math assessments in 1973, 1978 and 1982. The report, `` The Mathematics Report Card: Are We Measuring Up,'' said all three age groups improved recently, but mostly on low-level skills, and the 17-year-olds still have not regained all the ground they lost in the 1970s.

 As a 22-year-old Army nurse, <PERSON> Jacque </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> tended the casualties of war amid the monsoons, mud and gunfire of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, seeing both death and the enemy face-to-face. Though she defied the odds to save the wounded and held the hands of the dying who clung to her, alone and frightened, no trumpets sounded for her or the 10,000 other women who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, eight of whom gave their lives. `` I just do n't think people really understand what we did there,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON>, 39. Of the dozens of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> movies and television shows, none was about women until this spring, when <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> launched `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>,'' a Vietnam War series centered on combat nurse <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurphy </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Delany </PERSON>, and four other women with representative roles in the war. The final episode of the season airs tonight. The show has been renewed for the fall after a seven-week run that brought good ratings and critical praise. Mrs. <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON>, who co-edited the book, `` Nurses in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>: The Forgotten Veterans,'' believes the show is realistic. Scenes in which <PERSON> McMurphy </PERSON>'s hootch is blown up and she has to care for a <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> woman who killed an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier with a grenade bring back all too familiar memories. `` I feel what that nurse was doing was what I was doing. That was me,'' she said. But some female veterans complain the show stereotypes women in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as prostitutes, bimbos and manhunters, among other things. At the same time, they do agree it has redeeming value in making mass audiences aware that women served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perri </PERSON>, 42, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> combat nurse who now works for the <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON> Center for the Study of War and Social Consequences at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts-Boston </ORGANIZATION>, finds the show demeaning. Ms. <PERSON> Perri </PERSON> was one of 75 women who signed a recent petition protesting the way <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> portrays women. The petition, circulated at the second National Conference on Women and the Military held at the <ORGANIZATION> Joiner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, was sent to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` I feel insulted,'' Ms. <PERSON> Perri </PERSON> said, objecting in particular to a scene in which <PERSON> McMurphy </PERSON> dons a sequined miniskirt and joins singer <PERSON> Laurette </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Chloe </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, onstage at a USO club. Another sore spot for Ms. <PERSON> Perri </PERSON> and other veterans is the character of <LOCATION> K.C. </LOCATION>, a prostitute. Ms. <PERSON> Perri </PERSON> was unable to talk about her experiences in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> until three years ago, even though she had left 20 years ago. `` I was unable to deal with the stereotypes that people had about women who were in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` This show validates those stereotypes. The thing that is unrealistic is all this emphasis, these women characters as sexual beings.'' <PERSON> Cherie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON>, a 41-year-old <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, social worker who was with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, says her counterpart in `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>'' is so naive she never seems able to understand what is going on. `` I remember,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> said, `` being overwhelmed by the numbers of men and what was happening to them, the deaths and injuries, the thousand-yard stares, the guys who after a short period of time looked like there was nobody at home when you looked into their eyes. They were very old men in young bodies.'' Tired of having to smile and be friendly on the job, tired of being gawked at, she isolated herself in her hootch in the few off-duty hours she had. `` It's not a documentary, so we will from time to time bend things to fit dramatic purpose,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Broyles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, co-creator of the show and himself a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran. <PERSON> Broyles </PERSON> said female vets serve as consultants on the show and the producers have gone to great pains to make the characters, costumes and stories realistic. But was the Vietnam War itself real, given the contradictions and the contrasts? Where else could you have a front row seat to the drama of war, sitting on rooftop terraces, sipping scotch and water, watching flares light up the night skies and listening to the rumble of bombs and the rat-a-tat of machine-gun fire? `` I never had a sexual relationship over there,'' <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> writes in her book. `` Dating, well, you'd walk around bunkers and talk about home. ... You'd bring a bottle of wine and he'd bring the glasses. ... You'd sit and watch the B52s bomb across the DMZ... The sky would light up in different colors and you'd sit and watch the fireworks. ... It sounds strange, watching somebody's village get blown up. We did n't want to think about the lives being lost.''

 When <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> first met <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> in 1947, she sang a <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON> song for him. `` I thought it was safer,'' she says with a laugh. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> must have liked what he heard from the young actress who at the time was not known as a singer. `` He gave me the score for something called ` Kiss Me, <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>' and told me to learn it,'' Miss <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> recalls. `` He was having a difficult time raising the money for the show. It took over a year.'' The wait was worth it. `` Kiss Me, <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>'' turned out to be <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s biggest musical success and gave <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> the opportunity to play the temperamental <PERSON> Lili </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanessi </PERSON> and sing such songs as `` Wunderbar'' and `` So in Love.'' Forty years later, she will sing those songs again in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at `` A Cabaret for Cole,'' one of the opening attractions of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. The one-night concert will be held Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>. `` Broadway has always been my first love,'' says Miss <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> who now lives in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` You never lose that once you've tasted it.'' One of the women who turned down a role in `` Kiss Me, <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>'' will also be on hand for the Sunday songfest. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> will sing another <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> song, `` My Heart Belongs to Daddy'' from `` Leave It to Me,'' a number she first sang on Broadway 50 years ago. The show was Miss <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s Broadway debut and the song, a coy striptease number, made her a star. These two legendary women are not the only attractions at `` A Cabaret for Cole.'' The other singers doing the songs of <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> also have impeccable credentials. They include <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hildegarde </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Syms </PERSON>, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. The concert is a benefit for the <ORGANIZATION> Mabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> which was founded after Miss <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>'s death in 1984 to widen the audience for cabaret. The singer was generally considered to be the supreme cabaret artist, known for her ability to interpret a song's emotional sense From the late 1930s until the late 1970s, she sang in several <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> nightclubs including <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruban </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>'s, as well as at the St. Regis Hotel. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> was a great friend of Miss <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>. He thought her rendition of `` Just One of Those Things'' was the best version ever done. For Miss <PERSON> Morison </PERSON>, the chance to appear in `` Kiss Me, <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>'' 40 years ago was a dream come true. To do it, she needed to get out of a commitment to appear in what was a new line of work for actors in 1947 _ a TV series. `` I think it was called ` The Cases of <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>,''' Miss <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> says. `` I played a lady psychiatrist to whom the detective came and told his stories, lying on the couch.'' Miss <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> did get to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after the producer shot all her 13 segments on the television show in a quick two-week period and she agreed to publicize the series. `` Cole was a wonderful friend,'' Miss <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> says. `` He had an essential musicality. Plus there was the elegance of his lyrics. `` I just saw a concert version of ` Jubilee' which is where ` Begin the Beguine' came from. That was done in 1935. Even with all the topical and ` in' jokes of the period about <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON> and others, the young audience watching it got everything. Cole never seems to really date.''

<HEAD>Smelly Durian Fruit Barred from Singapore's New Subway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Long banned from most hotels, hospitals and commercial airliners in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the redoubtable durian is now barred from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s new subway, the <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> system. The fabled, smelly fruit is back in season and signs at each subway station warn: `` No durians are allowed on the <ORGANIZATION> MRT </ORGANIZATION>.'' Eating and drinking on trains has been a no-no since the subway opened in November, but shoppers were allowed to carry foodstuffs. So pungent is the durian, however, that extra precautions are deemed necessary to keep it at bay. Violators face the equivalent of a $ 250 fine. `` We all know that durians leave a lingering odor long after they are taken away, especially in an air-conditioned place, and the trains are air-conditioned,'' said an <ORGANIZATION> MRT </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` The smell is even offensive to those who love the fruit. They might like eating the fruit, but I do n't think they like the smell too much.'' Calling the spiky green fruit smelly does it an injustice. It stinks. Most descriptions of the durian's smell are unprintable, but one that is printable describes the fruit this way: `` Rich brimstone musk, whispering of depravity and month-old eggs. ... Durian is to fruit what limburger is to cheese and pornography is to literature.'' A British governor of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> in colonial days likened it to `` carrion in custard.'' The fragrance allows no indifference: You love it or you leave the room. The telltale stench permeates sections of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> now that the main season for the durian has started. Durians ripen twice a year, in December and January and in June and July. The powerful aroma is the perfume of prosperity for growers and others in the trade. Prices vary widely according to freshness, weight, shape and where they are grown, a market that seems as delicately balanced as Wall St. Three average durians sold for the equivalent of $ 5 as the season opened. Individual prime quality fruits fetched more than five times as much. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is the biggest commercial grower and old <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> hands usually rate Thai durians as tops in consistency and flavor. The most malodorous seem to be grown in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Malaysian devotees regard it as passion fruit capable of stirring deep emotions, and there are tales of patient Indonesians waiting days for durians to fall from trees, only to have to battle Sumatran tigers for possession of the fruit. Folklore warns that durian is `` heady'' and should not be eaten with alcohol. Those who do so are said to risk exploding. Related botanically to hibiscus, hollyhock, cotton and kapok, the durian is native to <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and has been cultivated for centuries. Unlike the shorter Thai plantation version, trees in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and elsewhere are too lofty to harvest and the fruit crashes to the ground when it is ripe. Fermentation that starts the moment it drops can change the flavor perceptibly within hours. The fruit spoils within a week and few will eat durian more than three days after they fall. No junk food, the much-loved, much-hated durian is high in protein, carbohydrates and vitamins B and C. Experts say it thrives in soil with a high sulfur content, which doubtless contributes to the pungent odor. Durians vary widely in size but usually are 8 inches long and 6 -LCB- inches wide and weigh about 6 -LCB- pounds. The outer rind bristles with tough thorns or `` duri.'' They are eaten raw after careful appraisal by purists who pride themselves on picking out just the right one. A heavy knife is used to split the fruit and expose the pulp, which ranges in color from pale yellow to bright orange. For those without ready access to durians, the fruit can be approximated by combining these ingredients: 3 bananas, 2 egg yolks, 1 pinch powdered sulfur, 3 tablespoons limburger cheese, 1 mashed garlic clove, one-quarter pound cream cheese for body and 1 shoelace for texture. Blend ingredients into a custard, mold around a horse chestnut and serve with apprehension.

 This spring, in the autumn of their time, they returned to where they once had been young. `` Red clay people from a red clay state,'' said one in the class of 1938 at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>. Once, maybe. Not now. Thunderheads darkened the evening sky that June 7, 1938 when they were given a diploma in one hand, a Bible in the other. Unforeseen winds were to strew them across the globe in a half-century of bearing witness. Depression. Three wars _ a victory, a standoff and a defeat _ burying their loss from each. The Bomb. <PERSON> Ike </PERSON>. JFK. Watergate. Heart transplants. The Bomb. 747s. TV. The'60s. The Bomb. LSD. PCs. PCBs. The Bomb. Once poor, they raised families in a flood tide of prosperity. And the Japanese cars some drove back to their 50th reunion gave a hint, perhaps, of its ebb. What their nation has seen and become, they have seen and become. They are a yearbook of their times.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar finished lower against the yen in trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, while stocks fell back modestly from their record-high close the previous day. The dollar closed at 125.77 yen, down 0.30 yen from Monday's finish It opened the day at 125.75 yen and moved in narrow range between 125.60 and 125.85 yen. `` The trading was relatively quiet without incentives to direct the market, and the dollar remained stable throughout the day,'' said a foreign exchange dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at 27,967.32, down 28.92 points, or 0.1 percent. On Monday, the stock market's key indicator rose 89.76 points and closed at an all-time high of 27,996.24 points. `` The Nikkei index is down a little, but issues such as large capitals, including shipbuilding and steel, continued to attract buying interest, raising the trading volume,'' said <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. The market remained strong without any fear among investors that prices were rising too high, he said. Some other traders, however, attributed the drop in the Nikkei index to a sense among some participants that the market was overheating, leading them to stay on the sidelines. The Nikkei index closed the morning session at 28,034.61 points, making today the second consecutive day it went above 28,000 at the end of the morning session, only to fall back in afternoon trading. Declining issues included automobiles and machineries. Advancers included steels, cements and high-tech issues.

 Two small savings and loans gambled on risky investments in real estate and such things as windmill farms, but collapsed from shaky lending that led to a record $ 1.35 billion federal payout to depositors, officials say. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Monday closed <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diversified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, both of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, without arranging for a takeover of the thrifts by another institution. `` These two represented abuses,'' said bank board member <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. `` The whole essence of being a depository institution with government-provided insurance is that there is a strong ... obligation to operate in a safe and sound manner. These two places did not.'' Both institutions have been insolvent for some time. Regulators took over management of American Diversified in 1986 and of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1987. The bank board is paying $ 1.14 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to American Diversified depositors in the largest cash payout the agency has made, agency Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. It is covering $ 209 million in deposits at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' program, both state and federal regulators are looking more closely today at troubled institutions than they were several years ago. A total of about $ 500,000 in both institutions exceeded the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 100,000 liability limit. Those depositors will share in liquidation proceeds. The bank board expects to recover about $ 400 million from the sale of the thrifts' assets. Nationally, only 10 of 235 failed savings and loans since 1981 have been resolved with a straight payout to depositors. Usually, the bank board pays a bonus to a healthy thrift to buy a sick <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L because it is cheaper. At the very least, the board arranges to transfer deposits to another institution. But the unique characteristics of the two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> thrifts made that impractical, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. The thrifts had few retail deposits, lacked branch offices, and relied on high-cost, short-term deposits arranged through brokers. The brokers in turn lent out the deposits for speculative real estate ventures and other risky investments, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. Closing the two thrifts will help all S & amp; Ls by reducing pressure to pay high interest rates, he said. Failing thrifts pay high rates to get the cash needed to meet expenses and some healthy thrifts have had to raise their rates to compete. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was paying 8.53 percent interest on deposits, 1.45 percentage points above the average for all thrift institutions. American Diversified was paying 8.64 percent. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a financial institutions analyst in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said the two thrifts were prime examples of `` several score'' high-flying institutions that in the early and mid-1980s used federally guaranteed deposits to fuel rapid growth of shaky lending. Regulators were unprepared for the boom and failed to check it, he said. `` It was a systemic breakdown,'' <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> said. `` What we are seeing are two of the more extreme examples of it. But they're not the only ones out there. There are others.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, director of accounting and general management for the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' 500 savings and loan institutions are insolvent and 200 of them `` are what we would classify as hopelessly insolvent.'' <PERSON> Duayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> dentist, formed <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1983. Taking advantage of the deregulated interest rates and liberalized lending and investment rules, it solicited deposits at high interest rates and invested the funds primarily in high-risk real estate deals that later failed. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> was killed in an automobile accident last year the day before regulators seized <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In a lawsuit filed against his estate and a former associate, the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> accused <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> of fraud, negligence and breach of fiduciary responsibility, and sought at least $ 40 million in damages. <PERSON> Ranhir </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahni </PERSON>, a former airline pilot, acquired American Diversified in 1983. He also pursued an aggressive growth strategy, increasing the thrift's asset size to almost $ 800 million, from $ 11 million, in less than two years. <PERSON> Sahni </PERSON> invested in `` wind farms'' designed to produce electricity, and in other non-traditional areas including two ethanol plants. Federal regulators have filed suit, accusing <PERSON> Sahni </PERSON> and other officers and directors of fraud and racketeering and are seeking at least $ 60 million in damages. American Diversifed and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> were two of six <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> savings and loans operating under the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` management consignment'' program as of October. Since 1984, 31 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> thrifts have come under receivership or conservatorship by state or federal regulators, according to the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan. `` The laws are still there to make it legal to get in trouble,'' said state Savings and Loan Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>. `` I do n't know how you insure against it.'' Prior to American Diversified, the largest cash payout was $ 300 million in 1984 to close the Empire Savings and Loan of Mesquite, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 Exports of Japanese cars and trucks to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fell a steep 20.3 percent in April, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. The association attributed the decline to a drop in sales of Japanese models and an increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production by Japanese automakers. <ORGANIZATION> JAMA </ORGANIZATION> said Japanese automakers sent 274,162 cars and trucks to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in April, the latest month for which statistics are available. That was down from 344,068 in the same month last year. For the first four months of 1988, combined car and truck exports are down 14.5 percent from the comparable period in 1987. While Japanese exports have fallen, the Big Three domestic automakers increased their market share. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have picked up a combined 3.2 points of market share in the car and truck market so far this year. The decline in the value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar versus the Japanese yen has forced Japanese automakers to raise prices to the point where many Japanese vehicles are more expensive than comparable American-made vehicles.

 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities fell in the latest auction to the lowest level in two weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 6.4 billion in three-month bills Monday at an average discount rate of 6.44 percent, down from 6.53 percent last week.

The rates were the lowest since May 23 when three-month bills sold for 6.34 percent and six-month bills averaged 6.71 percent. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 6.64 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,837.20 and 7.05 percent for a six-month bill selling for $ 9,660.30.

 The government will continue to stand behind the nation's troubled savings and loan institutions, but that could mean eventually having to turn to the taxpayers for more money, a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> official said today. `` I do n't know of any other source you could tap,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, director of accounting and general management for the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigating arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` The federal government has clearly said that regardless of the problems ... we stand behind the insurance,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. But, considering the state of the industry, if savings institutions are not able to supply the money needed by the insurance fund, `` there's only one other source, and that's ultimately the taxpayer,'' he said <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said some 500 savings and loans across the country are insolvent, and 20 of them are `` what we would classify as hopelessly insolvent.'' Two institutions closed Monday are neither the best nor the worst in the country, and there are a number of other large ones that will wind up costing about the same when they fail, he said. The record $ 1.35 billion payment to depositors in two failed <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings institutions is likely to renew debate over how long the fund that insures thrifts can last without congressional action. So far, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has gotten by without taxpayer money. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last August provided for an infusion of $ 10.8 billion over three years, to be raised by sale of bonds paid off by the industry. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the agency in charge of thrift institutions, has used $ 2.9 billion of that borrowing authority. The <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, which guarantees deposits up to $ 100,000, is paying $ 1.14 billion to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diversified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and $ 209 million to <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Both are located in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The American Diversified transaction is <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>'s largest cash payout in the agency's 54-year history, according to the top <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulator, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The agency has spent more on assistance transactions, including $ 2 billion a month ago to help <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> acquire four insolvent S & amp; Ls, and $ 1.3 billion in November to bail out <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, also of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. But in those cases most of the help came in the form of notes, promising payment if needed, and guarantees against certain future losses. The two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> transactions drop the insurance fund cash balance from $ 3.2 billion to $ 1.9 billion. However, another $ 465 million in revenue is due this month from insurance premiums paid by healthy S & amp; Ls. All told, including insurance premium payments by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, the fund should have about $ 20 billion to work with over three years and about $ 30 billion over 10 years. However, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> says that may not be enough. About 500 of the nation's 3,120 federally insured S & amp; Ls are considered insolvent and the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> says it will cost $ 26 billion to $ 36 billion to clean up the mess. Private analysts put the price tag even higher _ at about $ 50 billion. Problems ahead for the thrift industry include <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where 143 of 281 thrifts are ailing. <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> alone recorded a $ 1.2 billion loss in the first quarter of this year. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the rescue of the second largest <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L holding company in the nation, <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, is still pending. The <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is negotiating with the bank board over a takeover. Estimates of the cost of that bail out run into the billions. Wall says the bank board has all it can responsibly spend through 1990. But should more money be required, there are basically three sources where <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will look. The first is the industry. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, undersecretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, estimates the industry could finance something less than $ 15 billion. That's vigorously opposed by S & amp; L lobby groups. The second is the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has $ 18 billion to insure deposits in 13,650 commercial banks. Commercial banks and their regulators are already moving to try to head that off. The third source would be tax funds, not an easy proposition to get by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in an age of budget limits.

 The stock market headed lower today, running into resistance from sellers after its sharp rally over the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 118 points over the past five sessions, dropped 11.02 to 2,064.19 in the first half hour of trading today. Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 336 up, 656 down and 467 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 21.08 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Interest rates rose in the bond market this morning. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, fell about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value. Analysts said the pressure on bonds stemmed largely from inflation worries that have increased with rising commodity prices of late. Brokers said uncertainties over inflation and interest-rate prospects helped to discourage traders from chasing after stocks with the popular averages near the high end of the trading range in which they have fluctuated for the past several months.

 <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has offered to buy <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s oil and gas business for an undisclosed amount of cash. Gulf Financial, a private Houston-based investment and financial advisory firm, has requested a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON>. The offer is believed to be the first for the operations since <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> put them up for sale on May 25. Analysts have estimated that the units could fetch between $ 5 billion to $ 7 billion. In a letter to <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> set a Friday deadline for a meeting on the proposal, said <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Soussan </PERSON>, a principal in Gulf Financial. `` We're making a friendly and attractive offer,'' <PERSON> Soussan </PERSON> said Monday. `` We're waiting to hear from Mr. <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Soussan </PERSON> would not reveal how much Gulf Financial is offering or other details of the proposal, which was outlined to <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> in a letter last Wednesday. He said the offer is for both the exploration and production and the refining and marketing operations of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>. `` We plan to keep them as one entity in an ongoing company,'' <PERSON> Soussan </PERSON> said. `` We intend to retain the senior management and all employees. We would form a new company, <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, to continue the business.'' <PERSON> Soussan </PERSON> said the bid is the first by <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> in the energy field. Gulf Financial was formed two years ago to make real estate acquisitions but has yet to make a purchase, <PERSON> Soussan </PERSON> said. The company has bid for a number of large organizations _ real estate giant <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, department store owner <PERSON> Joske </PERSON>'s and most recently, <ORGANIZATION> Westin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Resorts _ but has come up empty each time. <PERSON> Soussan </PERSON> said that Gulf Financial has no staff. He said European interests back the company, but he would not disclose names. `` They are certainly one of those whose interest will be considered,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Macrum </PERSON> said. `` If they are deemed as being a qualified buyer, they will be invited'' to make a bid. <PERSON> Macrum </PERSON> said he could not say if <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> would be meeting Gulf Financial representatives.

 Grain and soybean futures prices opened sharply higher again this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, but many contracts quickly began to fade in early dealings. Wheat fell into the minus column shortly after the opening.

In addition, weekly crop reports released after the close of trading Monday showed some deterioration of the wheat crop, but it less than had been expected, said <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>. Weather conditions remain severely dry and warm in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, although there was some promise of showers in parts of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>FDA To Ban 4 Color Additives Used in Cosmetics, Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is planning to ban four color additives used in cosmetics and drugs because they may cause cancer. Officials announced Monday that the additives _ red dyes Nos. 8, 9 and 19, and orange dye No. 17 _ will be banned beginning July 15. The announcement followed an April 18 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in which the high court refused to let the government approve the use of color additives that pose a minimal risk of causing cancer. The court rejected arguments by the cosmetics industry that safe substances are being forced off the market. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> let stand a ruling last October by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here that federal law prohibits the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> from approving use of red dye No. 19 and orange dye No. 17 even though the cancer risks are `` trivial.'' Government researchers, citing tests with laboratory animals, said the lifetime use of a product with orange dye No. 17 poses a cancer risk of one in 19 billion, and for red dye No. 19 one in nine million. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said the threat from each use was `` so trivial as to be effectively no risk.'' The appeals court gave a strict interpretation to a 1960 federal law that prohibits <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval for any color additive `` found ... to induce cancer in man or animal.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, a lawyer for the activist consumer group <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, said the decision was important because the dyes offer no health benefit and some cancers will be prevented. `` For cosmetics, it may mean there a few shades of lipstick that will be lost. I think that will make no difference to people,'' he said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutt </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the Cosmetics, <ORGANIZATION> Toiletries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fragrances </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the decision was a disappointment but that it was `` more important as a symbol than in terms of its specific impact.''

 A rural <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> factory is making it easier to locate baggage at busy airports, place bets at <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> casinos and even find love in a bustling East Coast singles bar. <ORGANIZATION> Northstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> makes computerized indoor message boards and signs and is winning acceptance as one of the leaders in the industry. `` We really feel we're the Cadillac of the business,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Northstar </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>. `` That's what we're shooting for.'' <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> declines to disclose the 9-year-old company's sales figures but said they have grown by 20 percent to 30 percent a year since it was founded. He predicts that the light-emitting diode industry in five years should reach $ 200 million in sales, and he believes <ORGANIZATION> Northstar </ORGANIZATION> will capture up to 20 percent of the market. `` The opportunities are just unlimited,'' said <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>. The industry is relatively new. About six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies are manufacturing electronic message systems, and most are less than a decade old. <ORGANIZATION> Northstar </ORGANIZATION> started in 1979 with five products. It now offers more than 30, and is doing more custom design work, said <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, who joined the company in 1980 and became president in 1982. <ORGANIZATION> Northstar </ORGANIZATION>'s message boards can be programmed for hundreds of different messages from a computer keyboard. The messages can be programmed to run laterally or up and down and can be accompanied by graphics or animation. The message boards can be custom-built to any specifications, but many of the signs come with letters about 7 inches to 8 inches high, <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said. The boards are generally long but only about as deep as the letters. The signs are made up of hundreds of bulbs -LRB- most come with red bulbs -RRB- which light up according to a computer command to form messages. `` Specialized software is where the future lies,'' said <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, vice president and national sales manager and the last of <ORGANIZATION> Northstar </ORGANIZATION>'s three founders still with the company. <ORGANIZATION> Northstar </ORGANIZATION> was founded by two <LOCATION> Mayville </LOCATION> men, <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, and a Chicago-based computer consultant, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, who saw an untapped market for electronic message systems. The company operates out of a 5,000-square-foot plant located between <LOCATION> Mayville </LOCATION>, population 2,255, and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, population 627, about 55 miles north of <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, N.D. The plant employs 22 people full-time, and another dozen part-timers are on the payroll. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Northstar </ORGANIZATION> merged with <ORGANIZATION> Lexicon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> company that made computer software. The company has placed boards in airports, casinos, hospitals, restaurants, bars, bowling alleys, financial institutions and schools nationwide. <ORGANIZATION> Northstar </ORGANIZATION> boards flash instant odds on sporting events at <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'s Palace in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Harrah </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> Several mid-size airports use the boards to help travelers locate baggage and boarding areas. The company also has completed a deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Northstar </ORGANIZATION> has developed what it believes to be the first electronic display cardiac alert system in the nation, <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said. The system, which has been in use at the <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for four years, allows medical personnel to alert 27 critical areas of the hospital simultaneously during an emergency involving a heart patient, he says. Looking to the future, company officials see its message boards used as promotional devices on city buses, subway cars and pay-telephones. Company officials believe the airport industry provides the greatest potential, and <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said he is already working on more projects with major airports around the country. One of the most unusual uses of the company's message boards has been in a game called Selectrocution played in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> singles bars. In the game, bar patrons use a message board to make acquaintances. The game ends with the patrons being ranked for desirability by others in the bar and matched by computer at evening's end with anyone expressing mutual interest. With bids out on more than $ 16 million worth of projects and several others already in the works, <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> feels the future holds promise for his company. `` Our products are applicable in so many areas it's hard to narrow the scope to areas that will have the greatest impact,'' <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said. `` We're trying to look at key ... markets where we can concentrate and do a good job.''

 Cooler makers are putting on a new face this summer as they try to inspire fresh interest in a beverage category whose torrid growth pace slowed markedly last year. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Cooler beach party is history. So is the Sun Country cooler spokesbear. And actor <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> is missing from the action in new ads for <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION>'s Wine Coolers. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> are still pitching <ORGANIZATION> Bartles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jaymes </PERSON> coolers, but it is uncertain who is going to be dreaming up new commercials for the folksy pair since the ad agency that created the brand's fictional founding fathers quit. Something else is missing _ the fruit pulp that category pioneer <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Cooler had once brandished as evidence that it was `` the real stuff.'' But the cooler makers are trying to liven things up with new flavors that they hope will get people to try their first cooler or give them another try. <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION>'s, the category leader, plans eight flavors this year, up from six last year. <ORGANIZATION> Bartles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jaymes </PERSON> has doubled its list to four. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Cooler has five flavors, up from four a year ago. The big question facing the industry is whether coolers are a sustainable segment of the alcoholic beverage market or just a fad. Cooler sales tailed off in the second half of last summer, prompting some analysts to speculate that consumers had tired of the sweet-tasting concoctions of fruit juice, alcohol and water and were moving on to other drinks. According to Impact, a publication of <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shanken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that tracks the wine business, cooler shipments grew only 6 percent to an estimated 72.6 million cases in 1987. Industry executives said at an average price of about $ 3.50 for a four-pack, that put the retail value of the category at about $ 1.5 billion. But the 1987 growth rate was well below that in each of the previous three years in which the category rocketed from a few million cases in 1983. Impact said the category grew 65 percent in 1986 after tripling the previous year and soaring more than fivefold in 1984 when <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Cooler first encountered serious competition. Analysts said a slowdown in such growth was inevitable. `` Maybe for some people it was a fad,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fredrikson </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Gomberg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fredrikson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, wine industry consultants in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` But we believe there are hard-core wine-cooler drinkers out there who will continue to drink these products.'' <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanken </PERSON>, editor and publisher of Impact, said he also thought the category would survive and recently predicted it would amount to 133 million cases annually by the year 2000. They each cited the category's appeal to women drinkers and others who prefer an light-alcohol alternative to beer. The short-term outlook is unclear, however. <PERSON> Shanken </PERSON> refused to estimate growth prospects for 1988 and <PERSON> Fredrikson </PERSON> said the market may be flat. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Slone </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a trade publisher, said, `` A lot of people have their fingers crossed, but we have n't seen any upturn in that market yet. Among retailers, there is no expectation of any meaningful growth this year.'' <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION>'s Wine Coolers, from <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, nosed ahead of <ORGANIZATION> Bartles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jaymes </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; J. Gallo Winery of <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, last year, according to Impact. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Cooler from <ORGANIZATION> Brown-Forman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> was third, followed by <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Country </PERSON>, made by <ORGANIZATION> Canandaigua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of a town by that name in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> ended its two-year association with <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, the star of the television series `` Moonlighting,'' by mutual agreement this year, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Taxel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> executive. He said <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> helped <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> `` get to where we are in the market, but our needs now are more complex.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> will use a series of celebrities for different flavors of its coolers, including its new Lime Mist and <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION>'s Extra New ads aired so far have featured actors <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Guttenberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrelson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Bartles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jaymes </PERSON> introduced a berry flavor in January and a new peach cooler in April which, for the first time, was heralded in an ad featuring <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and Ed that was not created by <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>'s longtime agency, <ORGANIZATION> Hal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Riney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Partners of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Riney </PERSON> resigned last December, and <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> declined to discuss when a new fulltime agency may be retained. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Cooler had put the pulp in its citrus and orange coolers from the start in the early 1980s to make them look like the drinks that the today's coolers descended from _ mixtures of fruit juice and wine poured over huge blocks of ice in tubs on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s beaches in the 1960s. Its ads once featured songs from the era, like `` <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>'' and `` The Bird is the Word.'' But both the beach party scenes and the'60s classics are gone from the new ads that use special effects to do things like transform a cherry into a bottle of its new Wild Cherry Splash flavor. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shastid </PERSON>, an executive at <ORGANIZATION> Brown-Forman </ORGANIZATION>, said that while pulp had been an effective early addition to the drinks, consumers now realize coolers contain real fruit juice and prefer coolers without pulp. Sun Country dumped the pulp from its flavors, too, saying consumers were turned off by sediment at the bottom of the bottle. It has also retired the ad approach that used celebrities in polar bear costumes to pitch its drink, which now comes in eight flavors, up from six. The steamy ads for its new <LOCATION> Strawberry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blush </LOCATION> and Wild Jamaican Rum-Flavored wine coolers made the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS networks blush. Executives demanded revisions in the ads that show scantily-dressed men and women looking for relief from the heat, and Sun Country complied. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which entered the cooler market with <LOCATION> Matilda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> last fall, recently introduced its second flavor. Its ads pitch the only non-carbonated cooler among the majors as a drink from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. It is undaunted that another brewer, <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, abandoned the cooler market by discontinuing its <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> brand last year. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boykin </PERSON>, brand manager for <LOCATION> Matilda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is convinced of the longterm potential of the market. `` We think we can be one of the key players in the category,'' he said.

 In <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, cars carry the first `` European'' license plates, featuring a replica of a blue-and-yellow European flag. At a rural train stop in northern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> a new welcoming sign not only says the town is <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> but that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, or Common Market. In the Dutch town of Sint-Oedenrode a furniture-manufacturing plant flies the same flag that is on the <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>'s license plates, and a sticker on a restaurant window in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, site of <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, says: `` My country: <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Across much of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> outward signs are multiplying that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is drawing wider public interest in its quest to create a true community of nations and, in the view of proponents, gain greater influence on international economic and political matters. Already the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is in conflict with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on some economic issues, and business competition with these two economic powerhouses and other Western allies is growing in many areas. The most recent dispute with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is over <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> farm subsidies and their effects on American farmers. At the same time, the 12-nation community has been improving trade ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc _ even more so than with its Western allies. While the 31-year-old organization still is far from its goal of fully weaving together the economic, social and political fabric of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the integration process in recent years has reached a new plateau, one from which ordinary citizens can feel involved. The community has created its own currency, the European currency unit -LRB- ECU -RRB-, for bookkeeping purposes but eventually hopes to circulate the currency for common use among its people. To promote that idea, the winner of an annual EEC-sponsored tennis tournament is paid in an ECU check which can be cashed for another EEC national currency. It's still not clear how far the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> can go with its drive for greater European unity. Some of its members, including <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, show little desire to go beyond the creation of a simple common market in which goods and people can move freely across national frontiers. Others are dedicated to a grander goal: a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with a single political identity, or, as its founders liked to put it, a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Whatever the approach, the pool of money available for joint spending is limited. The members devote less than 2 percent of their national incomes to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> budget, which this year totals $ 55 billion. Even the more modest goal of ending national barriers to trade has been beyond the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s reach. Some European leaders say this is the organization's most damning failure, although most believe the bloc will meet its latest self-imposed deadline of 1992 for removing these barriers. An <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> study published in May said creation of a genuine common market by 1992 would mean a 4.5 percent boost in economic growth for the region, a 6 percent drop in consumer prices and 1.8 million new jobs. The study said the European economy could save as much as $ 320 billion over an unspecified `` medium term'' by achieving an integrated market. Despite its slightly blurred vision of the future, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> appears to have found new success in persuading people that the slow, tedious process of European integration is more than a bureaucratic exercise. Opinion polls show a slight increase in recent years in public support for the idea of European unification, although most people still have only a vague notion of what the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is and how it operates. A poll of people in all member nations late last year indicated that 85 percent thought their country's membership in the group was a good thing. A 1983 poll put the figure at 79 percent, and in 1980 it was 76 percent. In some ways the effort to make people feel attached to the aims and affairs of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is seen by its leaders as their most important task. In the early years of this decade, the Common Market was mired in a seemingly endless dispute over internal finances. Decisions on other matters fell far behind schedule. Nothing seemed to be getting done, and all the while people saw high inflation and growing unemployment. This was more than just another weak moment for an organization that had survived many while remaining largely on track. A turnaround began in June 1984. At a meeting in the 16th century <ORGANIZATION> Fontainebleau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chateau </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> government leaders resolved their budget wrangle, although other money problems cropped up later. Of possibly more lasting significance was a decision at that summit meeting to launch what was called a `` People's <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' campaign. The leaders at <LOCATION> Fontainebleau </LOCATION> recognized that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s problems went deeper than the money debate. They saw a need to make the whole integration process appear relevant to individual citizens, to make people believe that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s aspirations were bound up with their own. `` We're putting <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> back in gear,'' <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorn </PERSON>, then the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, said when the Fontainebleau Accords were announced.

 Among the programs created under the `` People's <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' initiative are a system of grants to university students wishing to study in an EEC country other than their own, and the introduction of new European symbols such as the flag and an anthem -LRB- <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s `` Ode to Joy'' -RRB- The grants programs was given the name <PERSON> Erasmus </PERSON> -LRB- European Action Scheme for the <ORGANIZATION> Mobility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to recall the 16th century Dutch humanist who was one of the great figures of the Renaissance. Since Fontainebleau, the Common Market has suffered many setbacks, including debilitating battles over its budget and failure to find a way of reducing the region's high jobless rate of 10.4 percent, which is nearly double the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rate of 5.4 percent. Its ambitious and costly plans for boosting the economic competitiveness of backward regions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> also have been largely disappointing. About one-sixth of the total <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> budget is devoted to these efforts. Yet the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has scored many successes. Some of the significant ones: _ Bringing <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> into the organization Jan. 1, 1986 In political terms, this was aimed at strengthening democracy in two nations that only a decade or so earlier had shed dictatorships. It also gave the EEC a combined population of 320 million, boosted itsride, calling his historic candidacy a `` catalyst for growth.'' Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination in the bag, expressed eagerness to face <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the fall. He said the two have many differences and `` I am ... on the right side.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today there may well be `` a floor fight or two'' with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his supporters at the Democratic National Convention next month, but he added, `` I do n't see any great divisions within our party.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` must go far beyond our current sanctions'' against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But he stopped short of calling <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist nation, a label demanded of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the party by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> talked in general terms of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s post-primary role in the party during a meeting last night, but he would not give details He said the vice presidency was not discussed. The four-month presidential primary season closed today with races in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. All three presidential contenders were in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> today, and all were staying in the state tonight to wait out the results of the day's contests Early turnout was reported light in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and moderate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The biggest prize is <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> tracking poll indicated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the state by a 2-1 margin, 61 percent to 30 percent. The survey, based on 415 interviews Saturday and Sunday, had a margin of error of 6 percentage points, the network reported Monday night. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials were predicting a low turnout, however. Secretary of State March <PERSON> Fong </PERSON> <PERSON> Eu </PERSON> said she expected a turnout of 48 percent, which would be the lowest in more than 40 years. Before today's voting began, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had nearly 1,900 delegates, leaving him fewer than 200 shy of the 2,081 needed to nominate. On Monday alone, more than 70 delegates flocked to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> trails with less than 1,000 delegates. There were 466 delegates at stake in today's primaries. In addition, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' former rivals for the nomination were lining up behind him. Campaign sources said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would travel to <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the day after the last primaries, to pick up Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s endorsement. The same day, the sources said, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was to endorse the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, was following it all from her hospital bed in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where she was recovering from spinal surgery. `` I think <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> will do well and I'm hoping by the eighth of June that he will have sewn up the convention,'' she said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, not noted for his effusiveness, nonetheless sounded like a happy man as he headed into the final contests. `` I'm really overwhelmed by the good feeling, the spirit, the confidence. A sense of victory is in the air,'' he said as he campaigned Monday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, however, suffered a primary-eve embarrassment when he missed the first 16 minutes of a live half-hour statewide broadcast that was supposed to showcase his campaign and provide a platform for a dramatic final appeal. The show's host, radio disc jockey <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasem </PERSON>, was left to conduct an awkward interview with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s state campaign chairman and show repetitive video montages of the campaign. When <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> finally arrived he appeared calm, but was perspiring profusely as he outlined his positions. Although <PERSON> Kasem </PERSON> had repeatedly referred to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s lateness during the first half of the broadcast, the candidate later contended `` we really came in on time'' because <PERSON> Kasem </PERSON> filled the air time. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he thought the broadcast went well. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> went to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> hotel room for a late-night meeting Monday night. Neither man would comment to reporters after the hour-and-a-half meeting, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> walked tight-lipped through a crush of reporters in the lobby. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published today that he had `` earned the option'' to be offered the vice presidential spot. He had said previously he deserved consideration for the post. In recent weeks, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been looking ahead to the convention and pressing his platform demands. But he has also been looking back at the most successful presidential campaign ever waged by a black candidate. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his candidacy has helped build racial tolerance. `` It's clear <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has become more and more accustomed to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as a possible next president,'' he said Monday. `` It's a matter of growth. I'm the stimulus. I'm the catalyst for that growth.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, got a primary-eve boost of sorts from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> announced Monday night that he was suspending plans for a controversial oil-drilling project off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. Earlier this week, in what was then a step away from the administration, the vice president called for a delay in the project. The two Democrats oppose it outright, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had faulted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for failing to do likewise. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking to a Republican audience on Monday, said he `` ca n't wait for this primary season to end'' so he can go head-to-head with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the primary season has been over for some time. He clinched the 1,139 delegates he needed for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination back in April. But the Republican competition effectively ended three months ago, when the vice president racked up landslide wins across the South.

 The stock market declined slightly today, running into resistance from sellers after its sharp rally over the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 118 points over the past five sessions, dropped 5.69 to 2,069.52 by noontime today on Wall Street Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 595 up, 712 down and 519 unchanged. Interest rates rose in the bond market today. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, fell about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value. Analysts said the pressure on bonds stemmed largely from inflation worries that have increased with rising commodity prices of late. Brokers said uncertainties over inflation and interest-rate prospects helped to discourage traders from chasing after stocks with the popular averages near the high end of the trading range in which they have fluctuated for the past several months.

<HEAD>European Experts Meet on Pollution Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARLSKRONA, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Experts from eastern and western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> met in this port city Tuesday in an attempt to sort out the pollution problems that are plaguing the Baltic and the North seas. A carpet of algae spread in recent weeks along the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> and Swedish coasts, killing farm trout and salmon worth millions of dollars and causing unknown damage to wild fish. An epidemic of a herpes virus has killed hundreds of seals in Danish and German waters this spring. Pollution from farms, sewers and industry was suspected in both cases.

The timing of the conference, coinciding with the algae plague, `` was not meant that way,'' said <PERSON> Wikstrom </PERSON>. But he said the algae was a main topic on the first day of talks. Farmers from all countries represented have been blamed for heavy use of fertilizers, which eventually find their way to the seas, and some municipal governments will face costly outlays for better sewage treatment if the seas are to be cleaned up. <PERSON> Harald </PERSON> <PERSON> Velner </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, singled out the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as major polluters.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices slipped in early trading today as investors apparently refocused their attention on negative economic signals. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond was down 15-32 point, or nearly $ 4.70 per $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, rose to 9.1 percent from 9.05 percent late Monday. Analysts said there was no news to send the market downward, but they suggested investors who ignored economic signs during a four-day rally last week might again be concerned about inflation and other factors. `` It's behaving more in lines with the -LRB- economic -RRB- fundamentals today,'' said <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market has been rallying here for a couple of weeks without any particular reason,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International `` I would have to chalk it up to normal, unexplainable bond market dynamics,'' he said of today's performance. Some analysts attributed the recent run-up to technical factors. During the rally, bond traders ignored soaring commodity prices, a harbinger of higher inflation that usually leads to credit market declines. Bond traders fear inflation because it erodes the value of fixed-income securities and can lead to higher interest rates. Some commodities prices were sharply higher in early trading today. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds today, prices of short-term government issues were unchanged to 1-32 point lower, intermediate maturities fell between -LRB- point and 5-16 point, and long-term issues were down -RRB- point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.24 to 109.41. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, fell 1.89 to 1,145.65. In corporate trading, industrials and utilities were down \ point in light trading, according to the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. However, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.19 to 279.58. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were up 1 basis point at 6.44 percent. Six-month bills rose 1 basis point to 6.72 percent and one-year bills were unchanged at 7.02 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 7 5-16 percent, up from 7 \ percent late Monday

 A federal appeals court today set aside a contempt of court order against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and an injunction barring the company from selling its Northeast shuttle to another subsidiary of its parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here ruled that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> failed to make proper factual findings when he held <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in contempt for taking steps to sell the profitable <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION> to a newly created subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. The deal was challenged by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, which contended the sale would violate the terms of a July, 1987 injunction that <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> had issued in another labor dispute involving Eastern. The <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 13,000 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees, contends that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> is trying to break up the airlines' various components to weaken the power of the unions at the financially troubled carrier, which <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> purchased in 1986. A unanimous three-judge panel dissolved the injunction issued by <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> that bars Eastern from proceeding with plans to sell the <LOCATION> Boston-to-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-to-Washington </LOCATION> shuttle to another subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> for $ 225 million. It also set aside the modified injunction <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> issued barring the sale, but gave the union 10 days to seek a temporary restraining order to stop the deal. The court directed <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> to hold a factual hearing to determine if an injunction is warranted. The court, in an opinion by Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, held that the July 1987 injunction <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> issued barring Eastern from transferring 6,000 ground-crew workers into a subsidiary called Airport Ground Services did not prohibit the shuttle deal. Thus Eastern could not be held in contempt of the 1987 order for taking steps to transfer ownership of the shuttle. `` In issuing the March order, the district court did not weigh the tradiitonal equitable criteria, nor did it make factual findings, necessary to support the issuance of a new or modified injunction,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> wrote in an opinion joined by Judges <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberdorfer </PERSON>. `` We appreciate the district court's concern that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement of the shuttle deal may have suggested a disregard for the spirit of the July injunction,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> wrote `` Nonetheless, this is an insufficient basis upon which to rest a finding of contempt where the district court has issued a new or modified injunction.'' <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> said the union had no immediate comment because its lawyers had not yet studied the decision. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said `` we are pleased with the decision and are studying its implications.''

<TEXT>
 In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, some bureaucrats in effect `` are saying the public be damned,'' said Soviet economist <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON>. The bureaucracy is sabotaging reform. Sitting nearby, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> was reminded of how rigid bureacuracry can be in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, too, not just in government but in the private sector as well. `` It reminds me of <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>'s first law of executive management,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professor. He paused, then stated the law: `` Businessmen inevitably become like their products.'' Consider the folks who ran the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry, he suggested. Like a vaudeville team working the boards, this unlikely duo produce a lively dialogue in support of their new book _ `` Capitalism, Communism and Coexistence'' _ comparing and contrasting capitalism and communism, forecasting and analyzing, and feeding cues to each other. They have had a lot of training. Both are accomplished economists, wise and witty, serious but colorful, of sufficient stature to state their positions with verve and confidence. And they have, since last summer. Discussing economics for 10 days at <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> home, they literally talked into existence their joint volume, which has been published simultaneously in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -LRB- by <LOCATION> Houghton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mifflin </LOCATION> -RRB- and in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. It defies the notion that serious economics needs to be dull. `` Each afternoon we met to consider our topic for the next morning; each morning we took up one of the subjects that gives title to one or more of the chapters in this book,'' <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> says in the introduction. The deeper purpose, he continues, `` was to show that an American and a Russian of different views could engage in civil and, we hoped, informative discussions of our different and common problems.'' The discussions were informed, of course, but more notably they were amazingly frank. Americans familiar with <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> expect that from him. But most Americans are unaccustomed to hearing a Soviet of the same sort. <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> official, member of the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and author of books such as `` Millionaires and Managers,'' is now on the staff of <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, published in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` We do n't represent an official view,'' <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON> said of himself and his partner. `` I wrote this as an independent person. It's my view.'' In his view, and <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>'s also, the economies of the two nations are in a period of critical change, with both facing huge problems of production, trade, budgeting and bureaucracy, to name a few commonly shared issues. `` There is a reassessment for both systems,'' said <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON> as he and <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> relaxed after promoting their book on an morning television show. `` Socialism is in a period of crisis or pre-crisis,'' <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON> continued. It's not a crisis in the sense that somebody is going to die, `` but the old ways of operating the system is no longer valid,'' he said. `` Once they might have been valid,'' he continued. `` It was probably right for building up heavy industry,'' he said, but he seemed to suggest that today's more open lifestyle and economy might benefit from consumer items, too. Changes must be made, <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON> said, seeming to feed a cue to <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>, who responded: `` In both systems there's a tendency to say: ` We're comfortable, we're on the right track.''' Bureacracy was common ground for the authors. <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> saw grave weakenesses in the American industrial structure. He expressed concern about the response to foreign competition. He commented on the bureaucratic neglect that allowed trade and budget deficits to develop. `` Ours is more dangerous,'' said <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON> about the Soviet bureaucracy. `` It acts in the name of the state.'' It is more dangerous than corporate bureacracy because `` in a corporation you have some competition.'' But you must beware of either kind, <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON> said. `` Bureaucracy leads to ossification and stagnation. We've had a stagnant economy for some time.'' `` We have 17 million bureacrats,'' he continued. `` What can you do with them?'' If you threaten to fire them they would merely fire others first. `` We must eliminate their power to give orders to plant managers. We must stop the meddling.'' Perhaps, <PERSON> Menshikov </PERSON> suggested, we should pay them but not listen to them.

 Share prices settled lower Tuesday, erasing most of the previous session's gains. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down 12.5 points, or 0.7 percent, at 1,820.2. The index rose 13.5 points on Monday. Volume was a robust 557.4 million shares, compared with Monday's 380.2 million shares Dealers said <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> players were keeping a close eye on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where the Dow Jones industrial average was 8.53 points lower at 2,066.68 as the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> session drew to a close. `` There's concern and lingering doubt whether we have really seen a turn in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market over the past week, and that has prevented people from chasing the market higher,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Semple </PERSON>, a market strategist at <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> WoodMac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>.

   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan is chipping away at its mammoth trade surplus</FIRST>
<SECOND>y expanding imports and overseas investment but the United States</SECOND>
<TEXT>
 has yet to adequately address its own foreign trade imbalance, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. In a report on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s foreign trade in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> MITI </ORGANIZATION> said structural changes in the country's economy, combined with the yen's appreciation against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, have led to increased imports and a slowing of growth in exports `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s industrial structure is becoming geared to domestic demand,'' said <PERSON> Atsushi </PERSON> <PERSON> Oi </PERSON>, director of the ministry's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` Manufactured imports are increasing rapidly and the distribution system is undergoing a change.'' Imports of manufactured goods rose to $ 73.9 billion in fiscal 1987 from $ 55.2 billion in fiscal 1986, fueled primarily by the rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen, according to government statistics. But the report warned that the budget and trade deficits of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as well as other international imbalances, `` are having a dampening influence on trade and investment by causing exchange rate fluctuations and destabilizing market prices.'' Some economists say the period of sharp reductions in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus is at an end While the surplus has been declining compared with last year's levels, the seasonally adjusted trade surplus has lately been increasing from month to month. <PERSON> Oi </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could reduce its trade deficit by slashing runaway consumer demand, expanding production facilities and revamping its export policy. The ministry report urged major industrial countries to coordinate their economic policies more closely in light of today's rising economic interdependence `` International policy coordination is essential to the effective resolution of imbalances,'' said Oi, whose office compiled the report, which has been issued annually since 1949. Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will fall from the present 40 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s total exports to 25 to 30 percent of total exports He did not predict how long it would take for that to happen. Spurred by the rapid rise in the value of the yen, imports of consumer goods from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> rose by 26.3 percent in 1987 over the previous year, the trade ministry said. Those from the newly industrialized countries of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> soared by 50.3 percent in the same period, according to the trade report. By comparison, imports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer goods rose only 8.4 percent. Since early 1985, the yen has risen by more than 100 percent against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, making Japanese exports more expensive overseas but boosting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s import buying power. <PERSON> Oi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is prepared to import more manufactured goods from <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nations and step up direct investment in the region. He said <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s newly industrialized countries have depended on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market for their development, `` but it will be difficult to continue to depend on exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' To offset the burden on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was prepared to help by absorbing more Asian products and offering technological and economic assistance, as well as stepping up direct investment, he said.

 Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> officials agreed Tuesday to step up trade contacts. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> responded favorably to a suggestion by <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> to create a panel of experts to discuss technical aspects of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s rocky trade relations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, officials said. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> also stressed the need for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the 12-nation EEC to widen their relations beyond trade to cultural and scientific sectors. `` The relationship between <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is not very strong or as well developed'' as that between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an aide to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told reporters. Senior EEC and Japanese officials meet annually. An <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> official said <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> believed regular meetings of experts could be useful in defusing trade tensions. The EEC is conducting numerous investigations of allegations of dumping by Japanese exporters. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> official, who asked not to be named, said <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> noted a `` remarkable improvement in trade relations'' between the 12-nation trade bloc and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, even though the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> continues to register a large trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The gap shrank by 4 percent in 1987, but was still $ 25 billion. For his part, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to turn the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> states into a single, borderless market by the end of 1992 was good for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But his aide quoted him as saying, `` The ... single market after 1992 should be the one which is open to the outside world'' and that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> should remove restrictions on Japanese exports. But he dismissed the idea of reciprocity in trade, an issue the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has given high priority in order to gain greater access for European goods to the Japanese market. `` We fully understand what -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Commission people are saying on reciprocity but <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> can not agree to reciprocity on a sectoral basis,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was quoted as saying. Among specific trade issues discussed were <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s high taxes on imported liquor and cars, the difficulties of foreign companies' bidding on Japanese public works projects and better access for EEC exports of telecommunications hardware and semiconductors The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> side also urged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to liberalize its banking sector. Officials said <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> stressed <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> banks must be able to establish themselves in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to make it easier to finance European exports and investments. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> also called on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to quickly comply with a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ruling to amend an accord with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on trade in semiconductors. The world trade body has ruled the deal discriminates against the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> also asked <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>' advice as to the best way to distribute $ 500 million <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has earmarked as special economic assistance to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` We are aware that <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries have a long relationship with African countries,'' the aide quoted <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> as saying.

<HEAD>ILO: Unions, Governments Do Little Against Child Labor</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Illegal exploitation of child workers is widespread in much of the Third World, and most national trade unions do little to combat it, according to a report released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The report by the Geneva-based group said some governments fail to enforce bans against child labor and even facilitate exploitation because industries that employ children can be important earners of foreign exchange. Some experts cited in the report estimate that at least 100 million boys and girls are employed worldwide, many of them younger than 10 years old and many unpaid. Those who are paid for their work `` rarely receive an income even approaching the minimum wage,'' the survey said. `` They receive no fringe benefits, insurance or social security payments ... child workers are the lowest paid but work the longest hours.'' The 226-page report noted that such conditions give employers a competitive advantage abroad. Regional studies included in the report said some exporters in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> would rather cease trading than replace children with adult labor because of the cost of the switch. The report deplored the `` almost total absence of initiatives by national workers' organizations in the campaign against child labor.'' `` Because the exploitation of child workers can be a threat to their economic interest and because it constitutes a violation of the rights and dignity for which labor has campaigned all along, workers' organizations have a particular obligation to promote and assist in the campaign against child labor,'' the report said. Recent efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> and by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are the `` almost sole exceptions,'' the report said. Case studies in the report acknowledged efforts made in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and said child labor was virtually eliminated in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> following improvements in social security benefits and education policy. But the report said that in much of the Third World, child labor continues to be `` widely prevalent _ in agriculture, industry, and services _ despite national legislation prohibiting it.'' Payment in many industries is made upon completion of a specified task or period, it said. In Peruvian gold mines and in deep sea fishing operations off the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, medicines, supplementary food, and working days lost because of illness are deducted from the pay, according to the report. Children, more likely to suffer occupational injuries, may be indebted to the employer at the end of the contract. Fifteen years ago, the confederation set a mimimum age of 12 or 13 for `` light work.'' But a study on child labor in the quarries and brickyards of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> found the majority of the children working there started `` even before they were eight years old,'' the report said. The report said that in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, family labor involved around 90 percent of all children between six and 15 years of age and was common in both rural and urban areas in a large variety of tasks, from washing clothes to the sale of crops on local markets.

<HEAD>Firm Offers to Pay 125 for Pro Bono Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A major international law firm said Tuesday it will pay the salaries of 125 young lawyers each year who are are willing to work for the poor for two years after law school. For five years beginning next June, <LOCATION> Skadden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arps </LOCATION> will funnel $ 10 million to qualified public service organizations to pay the salaries of <LOCATION> Skadden </LOCATION> Fellows. The lawyers would provide legal services in civil law for poor people deprived of civil or human rights and who, unlike persons accused of crime, are not guaranteed counsel by the Constitution. The program also will instill in the lawyers a taste for pro bono _ public benefit _ work, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>, executive partner of <LOCATION> Skadden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arps </LOCATION>, Slate, <ORGANIZATION> Meagher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flom </ORGANIZATION>, the firm. The program will take the form of fellowships that pay about $ 32,500 a year plus fringe benefits, comparable to second-year salaries of federal judicial clerks, said the announcement from <LOCATION> Skadden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arps </LOCATION>. Twenty-five Skadden Fellows will be named each year for the next five years and each will serve about two years. `` There are many lawyers interested in and capable of dealing with the legal problems the disadvantaged encounter, and there are many organizations that provide needy persons with legal services,'' said <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>. `` The problem has been that the organizations lack the funds to provide enough lawyers to fill the need, much less at a reasonable salary.'' A graduating lawyer applying for the fellowship must find a public service organization willing to employ him. <LOCATION> Skadden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arps </LOCATION>, founded 40 years ago, has 177 partners and 675 associates in seven major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities and in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's nominee to fill a vacancy on the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> assured a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee Tuesday that she would not vote automatically for less regulation of the transportation industry. `` A blind reliance on deregulation and minimal government interference can not always be relied upon to promote the public interest,'' <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Borlaug </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing on her nomination. `` Less regulation does not necessarily mean no regulation.'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 31, the chief economist for Republicans on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was praised by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members of the commerce panel. But several Democrats questioned her sharply about her views on the adequacy of government regulation of the trucking and railroad industries. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the sponsor of legislation that would make it easier for shippers to obtain government help in forcing railroads to lower their rates, complained that `` monopoly is allowed free rein'' by the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> in some instances `` The result can be rail rates for hauling grain that are too high, rates for hauling coal that are too high, higher food and utility bills for consumers across the country,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., a former secretary of transportation, argued against deregulation of the trucking industry `` I do n't think it's safe now. I do n't see weigh stations open, and I do n't see inspections taking place,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said she favors further deregulation of the trucking industry, and has `` a very open mind, generally, on rail matters.'' Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s surface transportation subcommittee, said he supports <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> `` I believe on balance, this nomination by the president is about as good as we could expect,'' he said after the hearing. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> was nominated to the $ 77,500-a-year job on Feb. 29.

 The stock market drifted lower today, running into resistance from sellers after its sharp rally over the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 118 points over the past five sessions, dropped 4.62 to 2,070.59 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 699 up, 722 down and 516 unchanged. Interest rates rose in the bond market today. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, fell about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value. Analysts said the pressure on bonds stemmed largely from inflation worries that have increased with rising commodity prices of late.

 <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's 10th biggest oil company, said Tuesday it has received several offers for its oil and gas operations since putting them up for sale two weeks ago. A spokesman declined to discuss details of any of the offers, but financial analysts have estimated the units could fetch between $ 5 billion to $ 7 billion. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Macrum </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, also would not identify any of the bidders, except to confirm that an offer had been received from <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a private Houston-based investment firm financed by European interests. <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that it had sent <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> a letter asking for a meeting to discuss details of its undisclosed cash offer. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> announced on May 25 that it wanted to get out of the oil and gas business to concentrate on its shipbuilding, farm equipment, auto parts and chemicals operations. It said it would use the proceeds to reduce its $ 8.5 billion debt. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s energy subsidiary, had operating income of $ 233 million on sales of $ 3.3 billion last year. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Soussan </PERSON>, a principal in Gulf Financial, would not reveal the offered price or other details concerning the proposal, which was made to <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> in a letter last Wednesday. He said the offer was for both the exploration and production and the refining and marketing operations of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>. `` We plan to keep them as one entity in an ongoing company,'' <PERSON> Soussan </PERSON> said. `` We intend to retain the senior management and all employees.'' <PERSON> Soussan </PERSON> declined to identify the European interests that back his company. He said Gulf Financial was formed two years ago to make real estate acquisitions but had yet to make a purchase. <PERSON> Macrum </PERSON> said Gulf Financial was one of `` many'' firms that had expressed an interest in acquiring the oil and gas units. `` We have received more than anticipated,'' <PERSON> Macrum </PERSON> said. He said he did not have a definite number, but said `` it's a lot, very extensive.'' The sale is being handled by the investment banking firms <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Macrum </PERSON> said the firms are reviewing offers to determine whether the bidders have the financial resources `` At some point, then we will call for bids and we will evaluate them. We will then name a winner. We hope to do that by the end of the year,'' he said.

 Earnings at the nation's commerical banks are rebounding from the worst year since the Depression in every region of the country except the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, the government said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the 13,541 banks it insures collectively earned $ 5 billion in the first three months of this year, down somewhat from $ 5.3 billion in the same period in 1987. However, earnings would have hit a new record high if not for the huge $ 1.49 billion loss at a single <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> bank holding company, said <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>. Banks' first quarter losses in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> totaled $ 1.64 billion, 90 percent of that from <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> has already pumped $ 1 billion into <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' largest banking organization, and may have to spend another $ 1 billion to attract a buyer to take it over. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> is negotiating with potential investors and hoped to put First RepublicBank back on its feet in the `` reasonably near future.'' Last year was the worst since the Depression for commercial banks: 184 banks failed, a record high, and banks as a whole earned only $ 3.6 billion, a record low, as big banks added to their reserves in anticipation of losses on loans to developing countries. Banks this year are continuing to fail at the 1987 rate. Seventy-five had closed their doors as of last Friday, 32 of them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. But otherwise <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> painted a generally optimistic picture for 1988. The number of banks on the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s problem list has dropped below 1,500 for the first time in two years, he said. There were 1,491 such institutions at the end of March, compared with a peak above 1,600 in mid-1987. The big money-center banks have written off about 25 percent to 30 percent of their Third World loans and that alone was responsible for much of last year's depressed earnings. Those reserve levels still look reasonable, he said. Prospects are also looking up for banks in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, a region where banks were affected by hard times on the farm. The percentage of <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> banks reporting losses fell from 13.5 percent in the first quarter a year ago to only 7.6 percent this year. Even in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> there is reason for hope, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. Twenty-seven percent of the banks in the region lost money in the first three months of this year, compared with 36 percent for all of last year. `` We expect the worst for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will be behind us after 1988,'' he said. `` The smaller banks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are beginning to show some improvement. Nothing large, but they are moving in the right direction.'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> also said he believed nationally banks were `` reasonably well protected'' against rising interest rates and could withstand a recession next year, provided the downturn is not extraordinarily deep or extended. He described his agency's insurance fund as `` solid,'' even though the price tag on the First RepublicBank bailout may cause the fund to register its first loss since it was established in 1934. `` We think we can handle anything we see on the horizon,'' he said. Despite record failures and record low earnings, commercial banks are still in far better shape than the 3,120 federally insured savings institutions, which lost $ 6.8 billion last year. First quarter figures are not yet available for thrifts.

 The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday he is confident the passenger railroad will survive and gain the support of the next president, whether Democrat or Republican. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has rejected ... proposals to terminate <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> for four successive years,'' <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON> told reporters, referring to repeated attempts by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to end federal subsidies for the railroad. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> is expected to get about $ 580 million in federal money next year but will cover two-thirds of its operating costs through various revenue sources, <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON> said. Only 48 percent of the rail system's costs were covered by revenues in 1981, he said. The administration repeatedly has called for an end to federal subsidies for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, but each time <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has continue to provide the rail system with reduced amounts of money. `` Today ... things are looking better,'' said <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON>, expressing optimism about getting the additional federal funds in future years that will allow <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> to begin expanding its operations. He said he expects either Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to support <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> if elected president, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has yet to say specifically whether he would favor increased funding for the railroad. <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON> said his key objective is to have both the Democratic and Republican parties go on record as supporting the continuing need for a national passenger rail system. `` I'm optimistic this will be the position of a new administration, whether <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> or Democratic,'' he said. While in recent years <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> has battled for its survival, <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON> talked during a session with reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> about expanding services in the years to come. `` The principal problem we see ahead is capacity. ... On weekends and hoidays we do n't have the equipment to accommodate peak loads on our unreserved <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corridor </ORGANIZATION> trains'' between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON> said that for the first time in recent years <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> has been on firm enough footing politically to obtain financing for new locomotives and train cars. He said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> has arranged financing for the purchase of 18 new diesel and electric locomotives and up to 100 new coach cars. `` The locomotives are now being delivered and the first 50 coaches will be on hand in 12 to 15 months,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The dollar finished slightly lower Tuesday in what traders said was a delayed reaction to news that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank had sold the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency Gold prices also fell. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 458.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 463.25 an ounce late Monday. Traders said investors continued to sell dollars as a `` follow-through'' to a report Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> had quietly sold at least $ 2 billion during the last week of May. Such a move lowered its huge dollar reserves and helped slow the dollar's recent rise `` There was some spillover activity from that,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, chief foreign-exchange dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office In addition, traders have begun squaring up their positions ahead of the government's report on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade figures for April, due to be released next Tuesday. `` Some banks seem to be scaling up their estimates of the trade deficit,'' noted <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The higher estimates spurred traders to sell dollars and take their profits. Manufacturers Hanover is forecasting an April deficit of $ 12.3 billion, higher than earlier rumors that pegged the shortfall at $ 10 billion, <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said. One bank was rumored to have predicted the deficit will be in the $ 14 billion range, <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said, which further depressed demand for the dollar. `` The market is trying to feel where we will find good support,'' he said. `` The dollar will be on the softer side for the remainder of the week ahead of the trade numbers.'' The dollar also declined in quiet European dealings. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.30 Japanese yen to a closing 125.77 yen. In late <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading it was quoted at 125.80 yen. At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar had fallen to 125.52 yen, down from 125.76 yen on Monday. The British pound strengthened following Monday's increase of half a percentage point in British interest rates. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, sterling gained just over a penny to trade at $ 1.8130, up from $ 1.8025 late Monday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.8138 to buy one pound, more expensive than Monday's $ 1.8006. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday, included: 1.7113 West German marks, down from 1.7134; 1.4254 Swiss francs, down from 1.4279; 5.7818 French francs, down from 5.8015; 1,271.65 Italian lire, down from 1,273.88, and 1.2283 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2321.

<HEAD>Government Announces Sale of State-Owned Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Tuesday that it would offer the state-owned bank, <ORGANIZATION> Girobank </ORGANIZATION>, for sale to a financial institution. <ORGANIZATION> Girobank </ORGANIZATION>, formally National Giro, is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s sixth-largest bank. It was set up in 1968 to cater to the banking needs of working-class Britons and is now part of the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. Industry Minister <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> announced the government's latest privatization in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, saying the bank `` now needs to expand vigorously. The sale of the bank, which analysts said could raise 300 million pounds, or about $ 543 million, is expected to take place by the end of the year. Merchant bankers will be in charge of assessing the bids for <ORGANIZATION> Girobank </ORGANIZATION> under the guidance of the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. The bank, which has about 2.5 million customers, had pretax profit last year of 23.1 million British pounds, or about $ 42 million, on revenue of 328 million pounds, or $ 594 million. `` It will ... be important to safeguard close links between <ORGANIZATION> Girobank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> counters,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said. Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has previously ruled out the privatization of the nation's mail delivery service, but not of other postal operations. In addition to the bank and the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> also oversees a subsidiary which runs the counters where stamps are sold, parcels weighed and banking services provided. Opposition lawmaker <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Benn </PERSON>, who as <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> government Postmaster General launched <ORGANIZATION> Girobank </ORGANIZATION> 22 years ago, said the privatization of the bank was a `` naked act of plunder'' of a public asset which had been `` wildly successful''. Although the offer price will be a major factor in deciding who takes over the bank, it will not simply be sold to the highest bidder, <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said. The government will also look at the bidders' plans for developing the bank, the impact of the sale on the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and other factors, he said. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> signaled government opposition to a takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Girobank </ORGANIZATION> by any of the `` Big Four'' commercial banking companies: <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Girobank </ORGANIZATION> is primarily used as a savings bank by retired and poor people who do n't need all the services of a retail bank. <ORGANIZATION> Girobank </ORGANIZATION> issues checks and has post office hours, which are longer than bank hours. It is also used to pay gas, electricity and other bills, as well as to wire money within <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and abroad. <ORGANIZATION> Girobank </ORGANIZATION> has reached a new five-year contract with the counters subsidiary through which it operates, <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has sold off billions of pounds worth of state-owned assets, primarily through the sale of shares to the public, as a way of promoting capitalism in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Companies sold off include <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the phone company which also used to be run by the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Arab Investment Bank Buys Near 50 Percent Stake In Gucci</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Arab investment bank said Tuesday it has acquired a nearly 50 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the luxury goods company, from <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> for an undisclosed sum. The investment bank, <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is based in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and is known as <ORGANIZATION> Investcorp </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment bank, had acquired the shares in <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of luxury handbags, shoes, clothes and fashion accessories, in a series of transactions from members of the feuding <PERSON> Gucci </PERSON> family over a period of eight months, said <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Morante </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> official. Florence-based <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> was was founded by <ORGANIZATION> Guccio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1900s as a saddlery business and has been controlled by his grandsons. <ORGANIZATION> Investcorp </ORGANIZATION> said separately that it was buying a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affiliate but did n't elaborate on the size of the stake involved A joint statement issued in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Investcorp </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> said the remaining 50 percent of the Italian company is held by <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gucci </PERSON>, one of the founder's grandsons. Italian authorities have issued a warrant for his arrest on charges of violating <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s foreign currency regulations. <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gucci </PERSON>'s holding currently is being supervised by Italian court-appointed custodians. A shareholding of less than 3 percent is held by <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gucci </PERSON>, another of the founder's grandsons. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimitruk </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Investcorp </ORGANIZATION>'s management committee, said <ORGANIZATION> Investcorp </ORGANIZATION> is n't currently pursuing the acquisition of the additional Italian <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION> shares. `` We are looking forward with confidence to a long, stable and harmonious ownership relationship with the other shareholders and the company'' s current operating management,'' <PERSON> Dimitruk </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Investcorp </ORGANIZATION>, whose shares are mainly held by investors from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION>, is a small investment bank which specializes in taking short - and medium-term stakes in relatively small, well-known companies Its recent investment activities include a major stake in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jeweler, <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Corn Up Sharply, Soybeans Push Slightly Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Corn futures advanced strongly and soybeans finished slightly higher despite some earlier profit taking Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat futures, on the other hand, fell by a nickel or more per bushel. On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy was higher; and precious metals declined. On Monday, prices on all six agricultural commodities had soared the daily permissible limit at the opening at the Board of Trade and stayed there as hot, dry weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> showed no signs of letting up. By contrast, commodities futures prices were very volatile on Tuesday, particularly in soybeans. `` Nonetheless, the performance was impressive,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON>, commodity research director in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Soybeans had increased more than $ 1 a bushel in the last week and had two consecutive sessions of 30 cent-limit gains going into Tuesday's session Prices opened sharply higher again, sold off almost immediately, staged a comeback and then faded near the close. `` The market was up so sharply, it was due to pull back,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Traders have made enough money and were willing to sell, and and selling tends to touch off further selling,'' he said. By day's end, the July soybean contract had traveled between a high of $ 9.09 a bushel to a low of $ 8.66 and closed with a 3-cent gain over Monday at $ 8.82. Wheat futures prices fell, however. Weekly crop reports released late Monday showed the deterioration in the winter wheat crop, which is about to be harvested, was not as severe as had been expected, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Wheat settled 4 -RCB- cents to 14 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.78 a bushel; corn was 9 cents to 12 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.57 \ a bushel; oats were 6 cents to the limit 15 cents higher with July at $ 2.21 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 10 -LCB- cents lower to 3 cents higher with July at $ 8.82 a bushel With a relatively subdued performance in grains, some upward price pressure was taken off livestock futures at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Over the last few sessions, the distant delivery months of pork and cattle have been pushed higher by the cost of grain, said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Waldock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. He said traders felt higher feed costs would reduce production of broilers and competition for red meat. Hog producers also were expected to slow expansion. `` So, with the grain market not nearly as wild as it was the last two sessions, we had some pressure relieved'' on livestock prices, said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. Live cattle settled .50 cent lower to .85 cent higher with the June contract at 73.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .75 cent to 1 cent higher with August at 75.92 cents a pound; live hogs were .77 cent lower to .50 cent higher with June at 52.92 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.25 cents lower to 1.35 cents higher with July at 54.87 cents a pound. Energy futures moved slightly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Prices were merely rebounding from sizable technical losses the day before, said <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` In addition,'' he said, `` there are some rumors that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is going to work out some compromises.'' Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meet in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> beginning Saturday. `` There's been some talk they'll attempt to get <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> back as an active member of the cartel,'' he said. `` And also rumors that they're ready to restart a dialog with non-OPEC nations.'' West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 11 cents higher with the July contract at $ 17.37 a barrel; heating oil was .25 cent to .46 cent higher with July at 46.23 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .10 cent to .47 cent higher with July at 50.20 cents a gallon. Precious metals futures were lower on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold settled $ 2.90 to $ 3.40 lower with the June contract at $ 460 a troy ounce; and silver was 3.5 cents to 3.8 cents lower with July at $ 7.28 a troy ounce.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday promised to give its stockholders a third of the $ 5 billion it expects to raise from asset sales as part of its bankruptcy reorganization plan. The <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based oil giant said the distribution would come in the form of a share buyback or some other `` direct shareholder participation or distribution,'' and would be made by the end of this year. `` The distribution may involve cash or the use of securities, in anticipation of the proceeds to be realized from the sales program,'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. It added that the other two-thirds of the proceeds would be used to repay debt, strengthen the balance sheet and fund increased capital investment programs for selected retained operations. Wall Street showed little response to the move, which came in the midst of a proxy fight between <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and takeover specialist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. In consolidated nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> closed at $ 51 per share, up 12 -LCB- cents. `` It's negative from the stock market's view, because it's not like they're giving the shareholders something they do n't already own,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pzena </PERSON>, who studies oil companies for the <ORGANIZATION> Sanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> securites firm. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is running a five-man slate for the board of directors, hoping to a victory will help him get the board to let shareholders vote of a $ 60-per-share cash offer for the company. The votes are to be cast at <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting on June 17. <PERSON> Pzena </PERSON> said that by adding some value to shares already hovering in the $ 50 range, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> in effect was diluting the impact of <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s $ 60 cash offer, thereby strengthening its chances of beating <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> in the proxy fight. That amounted to a negative on Wall Street, because `` $ 60 is better than $ 50,'' <PERSON> Pzena </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> claimed <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s objective in the move was `` to do just enough to get reelected and then get back to business as usual.'' `` Unfortunately, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> management will promise almost anything to keep me off the board and keep stockholders from voting for $ 60 or better,'' he said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s latest announcement updated its progress in other aspects of its reorganization plan. It came just 24 hours after it said it had agreed to sell its 99.12 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to a major utility in that country. Rheinish-Westfaelisches <ORGANIZATION> Elektrizitaetswerk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, also known as <ORGANIZATION> RWE </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to pay over $ 1.2 billion for the subsidiary. Both sides expect no problems with a requirement that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> approve the transaction. In its Tuesday announcement, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said it expected to generate more than $ 1.8 billion more in two other upcoming transactions. One is a deal to sell 60 million barrels of oil and gas equivalent reserves, expected to close by the end of this month. The other involves proposals to establish joint ventures with certain oil-producing countries. The ventures, which were `` in advanced stages of review,'' would involve three <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> refineries and related marketing facilities on the East and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> coasts. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> said the two other countries are <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The company also said studies were continuing on what to do with its 78 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, including the possible sale, merger or joint venture of some or all of the stake. In addition it said it was considering the potential sales of other domestic oil and gas properites of marginal value to the company, as well as certain European and African holdings. Finally, the restructuring program is expected to yield more than $ 50 million in additional savings in overhead from staff consolidations, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said. The latest developments are a result of months of negotiations that began as <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> prepared for its April emergence from a year under Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had filed for that protection a year earlier to avoid having to post an $ 11 billion security bond while appealing a $ 10.3 billion judgment held against it by <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. A jury ruled <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had interfered with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s 1984 attempt to acquire part of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> so it could buy <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> itself <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> agreed in December to settle the suit by paying $ 3 billion to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> as part of a restructuring plan that included sales of $ 3 billion worth of assets. Soon afterward, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, its largest stockholder with 14.8 percent of the company's shares, stepped up pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s management to do more to increase the value of its stock. In March, he threatened to run his slate of five candidates, including himself, for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board, if the company did not take steps that would raise the price to $ 55 per share from then-current levels in the $ 35-to - $ 45 range In an apparent bid for stockholder support, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> announced the restoration of its dividend and an expansion of its planned asset sales to $ 5 billion a month later. But <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, unsatisfied, proceeded with his $ 60-per-share offer for those <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shares he does not already known, and launched his threatened proxy fight.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's savings and loan rescue policy is aimed at protecting the customer's money and preserving the public's confidence in the system, a White House spokesman said Tuesday. At the same time, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> insisted there was no plan to resort to the use of general taxpayers' funds to bail out troubled institutions. He pronounced the White House satisfied with the way the federal regulators are handling the problem. But <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, director of accounting and financial management of the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said that, considering the state of the industry, the federal government might have to use general taxpayer revenues to shore up the system. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said some 500 savings and loans across the country are insolvent, and 200 of them are `` what we would classify as hopelessly insolvent.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged that `` clearly, we've got some difficult problems in that industry.'' He commented a day after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> ordered a record $ 1.35 billion cash bail-out payment to customers of two failed <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loans. The $ 1.35 billion figure represents roughly 40 percent of the FLSIC fund for financial institution rescue attempts. Analysts have said it likely will cost billions more than is in the budget to bail out other institutions. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, when asked about how the bank regulatory agency could withstand such financial pressures, said <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> has $ 10.8 billion in borrowing authority over the next three years. He took issue with estimates it likely would cost as much as $ 50 billion to put the industry back on a steady course. `` A lot of the S & amp; Ls that are in trouble are being bought out by other companies. A lot of them are in bankruptcy and they're trying to work out arrangements for them to stay in business. So, I do n't think it's fair to suggest that we're suddenly have a $ 50 billion bill `` This is not a new problem and it's one that is being planned for and the regulatory agencies have been handling it well and effectively,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` But be assured tha protecting the customers' money and the public's confidence in the system is the first priority of the regulatory agencies. And that's the way they're approaching it. And I think they have a very rational scheme for doing that,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. He would not say where the money would come from, however. Pressed to say whether taxpayers' money might eventually be used, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Well, right now we think the regulatory scheme is _ the regulatory complex is the right way to approach thismoney. There is a trust fund, money goes into it from the banks and from the member <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, and, at this point that's adequate, and we think the right way to handle it.'' In an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said the government would continue to stand behind the nation's troubled savings and loan institutions, but that eventually could mean having to turn to the taxpayers for more money. `` I do n't know of any other source you could tap,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` The federal government has clearly said that regardless of the problems ... we stand behind the insurance.'' But, considering the state of the industry, if savings institutions are not able to supply the money needed by the insurance fund, `` there's only one other source, and that's ultimately the taxpayer,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` Right now the situation is being managed, and we'll leave it at that.''

 Deliberations began Tuesday in the case of a widower suing three tobacco companies over the lung-cancer death of his wife, who smoked cigarettes for 40 years. The verdict in the 5-year-old case _ one of a dozen cigarette liability cases ever to go to a jury _ could maintain the $ 22 billion industry's unbeaten record in such suits or grant the first damages paid to smokers or their relatives. The six-person jury contains one smoker, two former smokers and three people who have never smoked. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> read instructions on the law and claims that the panel must consider. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> told five alternate jurors to remain on hand in case any jurors drop out. The jurors deliberated for more than four hours before being dismissed for the night. The panel must decide charges by <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> contributed to the death of his 58-year-old wife, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, in 1984. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> contends the companies misled the public about the dangers of smoking through public relations, advertising and inadequate research. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> told the jurors they must decide four basic claims: fraudulent misrepresentation and conspiracy to do so against each company, and failure to warn and violation of a warranty against <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>. The warning and warranty claims apply only to <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> because Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> smoked that company's cigarettes before warning labels were placed on cigarette packages and advertising in 1966. Courts have ruled that the labels pre-empt liability claims after that date. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> framed the main charge as a claim that the companies `` fraudulently misrepresented material facts to consumers concerning significant health risks associated with cigarette smoking.'' He said the jury has to determine five things _ that before 1966 the company made a false representation; that the company knew the representation was false; that the company meant to deceive people; that Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> believed the representation, justifiably relied on it and was induced to continue smoking; and that the representation was a `` proximate cause'' of her cancer and death. The phrase `` proximate cause'' played a key role in the jury instructions. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> said the panel has to consider whether the companies' conduct before 1966 was a proximate cause of her smoking, and then whether the smoking was a proximate cause of her death and disease. The legal term means activity that `` naturally and probably led to and might have been expected to'' create the condition alleged, <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> does n't have to prove thatthe companies' conduct was the only or even main reason why she smoked, only that it was a `` substantial contributing factor.

<HEAD>SEC Not Probing Most Foreign Insider-Trading Cases, Report Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has been unable to handle a flood of foreign-based insider trading cases referred to it in recent years, according to information compiled by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. An investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> commerce, consumer and monetary affairs subcommittee, whose results were made available Tuesday, concluded that of 609 suspected insider-trading cases referred by the stock exchanges to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and 1987, about 225 involved foreign trading. Of the 225, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> pursued only 57, the study said. `` With the growing internationalization of securities markets, there is deepening concern that both foreign citizens and Americans will be able to use foreign accounts to trade illegally in our markets by utilizing insider trading information or manipulating the market, and that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> may be unable to properly investigate such trading,'' subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Ga., said in a statement According to the study's findings, the nation's stock exchanges often take a long time to report suspicious transactions to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> takes an average of one year to give such information to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and has taken up to 28 months, the panel concluded. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> exchange spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON> said she would not challenge the figures in the report, but said the exchange conducts its own investigations and is trying to speed the process it uses to gather and report information on unusual transactions. The investigation concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> does not pursue cases involving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION> and other countries with whom the commission lacks information-sharing agreements. The subcommittee also found that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has been looking into suspected instances of insider-trading involving <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and other companies. <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, whose subcommittee scheduled a hearing on the subject for Wednesday, said in his statement that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has given a low priority to international enforcement by assigning only two people to its Office of International Legal Assistance. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McCue </PERSON> declined to comment on the study, saying commission Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> would testify at Wednesday's hearing. But in Tuesday's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, which initially reported the subcommittee's findings, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement chief, said of the commission's international efforts: `` We've been very aggressive, and have made remarkable strides in the last several years.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday released a draft of proposed legislation designed to increase its ability to combat insider-trading and other securities law violations by foreigners. The bill would give the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> authority to issue subpoenas and take testimony in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on behalf of foreign securities regulators with the idea that other countries, in turn, would provide the same assistance to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 USG. <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has rescheduled for July 8 a vote by its stockholders on a defensive recapitalization and business restructuring plan it proposed to counter a takeover attempt by a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> partnership. The vote was originally scheduled for a special meeting on June 24, but was rescheduled on Monday by <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s board for July 8 at 9 a.m. <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it was delaying the vote to give stockholders extra time to consider proxy materials relating to the proposed recapitalization. The plan, announced May 2, would give stockholders $ 37 in cash, $ 5 in 16 percent pay-in-kind junior subordinated debentures and one new share of common stock, <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> said in a release. The company would take on $ 2.2 billion in new debt to pay for the recapitalization, aimed at warding off a takeover attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>, a partnership headed by two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilmen. USG also announced that, at <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> request, the federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> had delayed the partnership's appeal on a ruling upholding <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholder rights plan. The appeal was put off until after the shareholders' vote next month.

 International bankers and businessmen said Tuesday that the stage was being set for the eventual creation of a universal banking system, which would offer a variety of financial services to customers around the globe. For one thing, regulatory barriers that separated investment and commercial banks, such as the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, were being abolished or re-examined, <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gut </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suisse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. He said the bank of the future will have to change its business strategy by becoming more competitive and aggressive. `` In the 1990s, the typical manager in a successful universal bank, will be globally oriented, have a flair for market opportunities, and possess entrepreneurial instincts,'' Gut said in prepared remarks made available to the news media. The three-day monetary conference, in its 34th year, provides leaders of the top commerical banks and corporations in about two dozen countries an opportunity to confer with government officials on topics affecting the world economy and international banking. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and other central bankers from abroad were scheduled to attend Wednesday's closed-door session. Much of Tuesday's session focused on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banking system with some conference participants criticizing the inconsistencies between domestic and foreign regulations. `` Effective governance, both domestic and international, has not kept pace,'' <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told the conference. `` Our sites must be set on achieving an environment in which all types of financial institutions can compete with adequate rules of fair play _ a credible regulatory framework,'' he said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said all financial institutions should have fair access to the global markets while countries work together to harmonize otherwise outdated regulations. Later, at a media briefing Tuesday, several bankers, including <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest banking company, briefly discussed the level of regulation among global institutions. <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Heldring </PERSON> said big banks that take risks should n't always expect government protection. `` We ultimately could come to a form of Chapter 11'' federal bankruptcy reorganization, <ORGANIZATION> Heldring </ORGANIZATION> said. `` If a bank is too large to fail, it is subject to the risk of becoming an arm of government.'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> agreed, `` It makes us more vulnerable to becoming bullied by the regulators.'' He noted that while government regulators look at the role banks play in society, `` the sociology does n't play in the management room. We should be allowed to fail as anyone else.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics industry announced Tuesday it will seek to re-enter the consumer business lost to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by playing a major role in the projected $ 40 billion world market for a new generation of televisions. Calling the effort to catch up to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in advanced television research a `` last window of opportunity,'' the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said it is forming a task force to explore a possible alliance of industry, government and academia. At a meeting Monday of more than 50 computer, semiconductor and telecommunications industry leaders, government officials and academic researchers, a consensus was reached in five areas: _ The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics industry should be in the consumer business _ Advanced television, which is expected to deliver stunningly realistic images and sound, means more to the electronics industry than just re-entering the consumer market _ Advanced television will drive the leading edge technologies, such as advanced semiconductors _ An open system of design should be used rather than one that locks in specific parameters and specific manufacturers _ A broadcast standard should be adopted that is advantageous to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers, broadcasters and consumers `` We found that the implications for ATV -LRB- advanced television -RRB- for our industry and for the economic well-being of the country are pervasive,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, vice president of the 3,500-member <ORGANIZATION> AEA </ORGANIZATION>. `` One point stressed throughout the meeting,'' he said, `` was the non-participation in this market by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics industry will mean the loss of our leading edge research and, in turn, our ability to compete in the emerging global marketplace.'' Companies attending the electronics powwow included <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Among the government officials was <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON>, assistant secretary of Commerce for communication and information policy. `` We hope this is a catalytic meeting for what is to be done,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> AEA </ORGANIZATION>, which hosted the meeting at its headquarters. `` We're talking about how we got to where we are n't,'' he said wryly, `` and finding out where we want to go.'' Where they are n't, he said, is in consumer electronics, a multibillion-dollar industry pioneered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies but now dominated by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The group Monday talked about whether high-definition television, which the Japanese have been working on for several years, will revolutionize the TV industry and spin off as many other technologies as did videotape and digital recording. `` We're reminding ourselves of the stakes involved,'' <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> said. `` There's a whole lot more involved here than TVs. We're talking about a whole electronics era The tone in the room is leading us to the conclusion it is a revolution in electronics. That's certainly <ORGANIZATION> AEA </ORGANIZATION>'s conclusion.'' Although it is unusual to have competitive companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> meet to discuss broad technological ventures, and to have government involved as well, such meetings are common in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` The Japanese have been at it for 20 years, and they're way ahead of us on this technology,'' <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> said.

 Financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> denied a published report Tuesday that it has sold its lines of plastic outdoor toys for an estimated $ 30 million. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Wruck </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> vice president, said the report of a sale to <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest toy company, was premature. However, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it has `` already received offers for the sale.'' `` We do intend to find a purchaser for that product line. The company has not announced anything official at this point,'' <PERSON> Wruck </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> also said Tuesday that its short-term lenders have extended to June 30 an interim financing arrangement that expired on June 1. The extension is intended to provide the company with funds as it tries to reduce and restructure its bank debt through the sale of assets and to arrange for new working capital. The Hartford Courant, quoting industry analysts and <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> sources, said <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> had reached an agreement to sell the lines that helped launch the company more than 30 years ago. The newspaper said <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> had an agreement to buy the product lines and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> plant where they are produced in partnership with an unidentified Canadian investor. According to the newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> executives told workers of the sales agreement during an employee meeting at the company's headquarters <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Charness </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION>, R.I.-based <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment on the newspaper report. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 47.4 million in the first quarter of this year, and has been in default on the interest payments on $ 335 million of its debt securities. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president for finance, said he was notified Tuesday that investors owning about $ 120 million of those bonds had withdrawn a previous demand for immediate repayment. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> has offered to exchange the $ 335 million in bonds for a combination of new bonds and common stock, but the orginal terms of that offer were rejected by investors. The company has extended the offer to June 30. The product lines to be sold, the newspaper report said, include plastic wading and splashing pools, pool filters, children's outdoor furniture and clubhouses, and pedal-powered and battery-operated cycles. Those lines, which helped launched <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> in the toy business in 1956, had sales last year of $ 77 million and are produced at plants near <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, owned or leased by <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>.

 Financier <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> disclosed he may sell his controlling share of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, or restructure the corporation by selling a film production unit and other assets, a top executive said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged receiving offers from more than one potential buyer, but none of the suitors have been identified, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief operating officer. `` We have not disclosed that at all,'' <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON> said. Asked about reports that <PERSON> N.V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Philips </PERSON> was the leading contender among several foreign firms interested in acquiring the movie and television company, <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON> said, `` I really ca n't confirm or deny it.'' <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> filed an amendment Tuesday to an April 6 report to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which stated he was considering selling all or part of his 82 percent stake in the company. <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s amended <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing shows he is considering disposing of his shares as well as considering a restructuring. The restructuring `` could involve the sale of one of the motion picute production units and additional assets such as interests in our distribution organizations,'' <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON> said. A substantial amount of the proceeds would be distributed to stockholders, he said. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> has spent the past two decades buying, selling and buying back assests of the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> studios. The movie and television conglomerate has been on the auction block for the past two months.

 The nation's thrift industry is showing more signs of strain, but the government says the productivity of the nation's work force is still on the rise. Federal regulators announced a record $ 1.35 billion payout to close two insolvent savings institutions Monday. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported a big increase in productivity statistics for the first quarter. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> closed <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diversified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, both of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, without arranging for a takeover by another institution. Only 10 of 235 failed S & amp; Ls handled since 1981 have been resolved with a straight payoff of depositors. Usually, the bank board pays a bonus to a healthy thrift to buy a sick S & amp; L or arranges to transfer deposits to another institution. But bank board Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said the thrifts had little value as going concerns because they had few retail deposits and lacked branch offices. Both also relied on high-cost, short-term deposits arranged through brokers, which they in turn lent out for speculative real estate ventures and other risky investments. The institutions have been insolvent for some time. Regulators took over the management of American Diversified in February 1986 and of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Savings in January 1987. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said the bank board is paying $ 1.14 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to American Diversified depositors, the largest cash payout the agency has ever made. It is covering $ 209 million in deposits at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Savings. Deposits up to the insurance limit of $ 100,000 will be available beginning Tuesday. A total of about $ 500,000 in both institutions exceeded the limit. Those depositors will share in liquidation proceeds. In a new economic report, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the nation's efficiency in churning out goods and services improved more than four times more rapidily during the first quarter of 1988 than it did in 1987 But average annualized hourly wage gains of only 3.4 percent failed to put most workers ahead of inflation for the fifth quarter in a row, it said. Not since the spiraling inflation of 1979-81 have workers gone that long without an improvement in their standard of living through wage gains, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. Productivity among the nation's non-farm businesses increased at an annual rate of 3.6 percent during January through March. Preliminary figures last month had put the improvement at only 0.9 percent. But those earlier figures were issued before the gross national product _ the broadest measure of economic growth _ was revised upward. In another sign of improving economic conditions, the number of Americans late on their mortgage payments fell to the second-lowest level of this decade during the first three months of the year, a trade group of lenders reported. The Mortgage Bankers Association said the number of mortgage payments late by 30 days or more dropped to 4.78 percent of total mortgages in the first quarter, down from 4.95 percent in the last three months of 1987.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to sell its West German subsidiary to that country's largest utility in a deal worth slightly more than $ 1.2 billion, the two companies said. The sale of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 99.12 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> to Rheinish-Westfaelisches <ORGANIZATION> Elektrizitaetswerk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, also known as <ORGANIZATION> RWE </ORGANIZATION>, represents the first part of a $ 5 billion restructuring plan by this nation's third-largest oil company. <ORGANIZATION> RWE </ORGANIZATION> said at its <LOCATION> Essen </LOCATION> headquarters that it would pay $ 1.23 billion to close the deal, which was signed Monday in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and which is subject to approval by the West German <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. Both sides said they expected no problems with the German authorities. It will become effective five days after the permission arrives, probably by the end of the month, <ORGANIZATION> RWE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Gieske </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> began negotiating the sale months ago, as it prepared for its April emergence from a year under Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection. The <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based oil giant had filed for that protection a year earlier to avoid having to post an $ 11 billion security bond while appealing a $ 10.3 billion judgment held against it by <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. A jury ruled <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had interfered with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s 1984 attempt to acquire part of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> so it could buy <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> itself In December, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> agreed to settle the suit by paying $ 3 billion to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> as part of a restructuring plan that included sales of $ 3 billion worth of assets. Soon afterward, takeover artist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, its largest stockholder with 14.8 percent of the company's shares, stepped up pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s management to do more to increase the value of its stock. In March, he threatened to run a slate of five candidates, including himself, for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board, if the company did not take steps that would raise the price to $ 55 per share from then-current levels in the $ 30-to - $ 40 range <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, in an apparent bid for stockholder support, announced the restoration of its dividend and an expansion of its planned asset sales to $ 5 billion a month later. But <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was not satisfied. Recently, he offered $ 60 per share for those <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shares he does not already known, and launched his threatened proxy fight for the five seats on the company's board. The results will be announced at <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting on June 17. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, meanwhile has continued to hover at levels near $ 50 per share, as <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> kept up his attacks on its management. Commenting on the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> sale, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON>, president of the parent company, apparently had those criticisms in mind. `` The proceeds from this transaction, together with those from other imminent asset sales and joint venture partnerships, will be providing real benefits to our shareholders,'' he said in a statement. `` We are committed to significantly enhancing the value of our shareholders' investment.'' Exactly how <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would benefit from the sale, <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> did not say. There has been speculation that it might issue a special dividend to shareholders or disburse the proceeds in some other manner. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock rose 87 -LCB- cents a share to close at $ 50.87 -LCB- in trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. As part of its restructuring, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has also been negotiating the sale of 60 million barrels of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil and natural gas reserves, and has been talking with <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> about establishing joint ventures involving East - and Gulf-coast refining and marketing interests <ORGANIZATION> RWE </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s eighth-largest corporation, is active in the production and supply of electricity, brown coal mining, and the petroleum and chemicals businesses, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said. It said it acquired <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, in the mid-1960s. The German company is active in all phases of the oil business, from exploration and production to petrochemicals. It owns two refineries, capable of producing 140,000 barrels daily, and holds a 10.2 percent share of the West German retail gasoline market, with about 1,900 Texaco-branded retail outlets throughtout the country.

<HEAD>Bass, Macmillan Move Buyout Battle To The Courtroom</HEAD>

 The courtroom is likely to be the scene of the next encounter between <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the giant publishing company he has offered to buy for $ 1.9 billion, or $ 73 a share. Bass filed a lawsuit Monday after <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> failed to respond to his latest offer, but <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> had already filed its own suit charging Bass with securities laws violations. `` Going to court clearly makes this unfriendly, but it already really was,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. On Wall Street, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> jumped $ 3.50 a share to $ 75 in trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts were nonplussed by the legal developments and said it is likely the Bass suit will delay the restructuring dividend <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> plans to begin paying shareholders on Friday. The Macmillan board, which rejected <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>'s initial $ 64-a-share offer as inadequate, adopted a plan to split the company's publishing and non-publishing operations into two separate, publicly owned corporations Part of the plan includes paying shareholders a special dividend of $ 52.35 a share. In a suit filed Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> is seeking to block the company from proceeding with the payout. In what analysts characterized as a further attempt to appease management, Bass alternatively offered to restructure the company along the lines of a plan <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> unveiled last week, but on terms more favorable to shareholders. He is offering a payout of $ 58 a share. Bass representatives made the proposals at a meeting over the weekend with <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s investment bankers and requested a response by noon Monday. But <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> allowed the deadline to tick by, saying in a statement it would consider the proposal `` later in the week.'' In its suit filed Monday morning in federal court for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> charged <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> with `` repeated filing and public dissemination of misleading statements ... in order to engage in creeping tender offers ...'' The suit further claims that the defendants were `` so anxious to hide their intent, to deceive <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> and its shareholders, and to manipulate the market in <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> shares, that on or about Oct. 13, 1987, the broker who was placing defendants' orders for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> shares falsely stated that he was acting on behalf of <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> itself.'' The Bass group holds about 9.1 percent of <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s roughly 26 million outstanding shares. The stake was built between August 1987 and last month, according to the lawsuit. Neither side would comment further on the latest developments. Analysts had predicted the battle would move to the courtroom. `` It was a logical reaction for both sides to what was going on,'' said <PERSON> Berk </PERSON> <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. There has been considerable speculation that a third party might surface, and that remains a possibility, analysts say. `` But with both Bass and <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> putting short deadlines, it puts a squeeze on anybody new coming in,'' <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> said. Separately, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> disclosed that `` an entity related to the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'' has requested government approval to acquire more than 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares.

In fact, he said, by working together to stabilize exchange rates and coordinate economic policies, the major industrialized nations withstood the worst effects of last October's global stock market collapse. `` It would have been easy for each of us to turn inward and focus on short-term measures to address immediate domestic needs,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Monday. Instead, he said, the nations `` pulled together and intensified ... efforts to find a compatible and reinforcing set of policies to achieve common goals. `` Since that time, strengthened underlying policy actions have been reflected in enhanced stability of exchange markets,'' he said. `` ... The world economy ... is on a much more solid footing.'' While many conference participants echoed those sentiments Monday, others called upon corporate America to work more on its own to sharpen overseas competitiveness. `` Of course <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry owes a large part of these improvements to the weakness of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. -LRB- But -RRB- the supportive strength of the exchange rates can fade as fast as it has arrived,'' said West German businessmen <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spethmann </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Thyssen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION>, in prepared remarks. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses have more going for them than some of their foreign competitors, including a mobile labor force, flexible labor costs, favorable energy costs and the largest single market in the world. <PERSON> Yotaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobayashi </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said, `` For survival in this volatile global business environment, not only American corporations, but businesses around the world are making significant efforts to expand from their geographic area of strength into other major markets of the world. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> seeks to provide leaders of the top commercial banks and businesses in about 20 different countries with a chance to confer with government officials on topics affecting the world economy as a whole, and the international banking industry in particular. Besides <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and other central bankers were among those scheduled to attend closed-door `` think sessions'' and speeches. At the opening sessions Monday, the main theme was global cooperation and competitiveness. `` If a deficit country reins in domestic consumption too much, a recession can result,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Seipp </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> IMC </ORGANIZATION>, in a prepared statement. `` On the other hand, if domestic demand in surplus countries is stimulated too much, this could then create the threat of renewed inflation.'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, chairman of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, agreed: `` Each of the problems in question is a matter of common concern, in that each has spillover consequences for the other.'' The bankers, though, said politics was among the obstacles standing in the way of global harmony. `` Even when there is agreement on the objectives ... there may well be difficulties in undoing arduously worked out domestic compromises, or in obtaining timely domestic action where policy-making is decentralized,'' <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said. Specifically, he called upon the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reduce its large federal budget deficit as a way of keeping interest rates down and narrowing its trade gap. He also said <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should work toward stimulating their economies. In his address Monday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said steps taken beginning in September 1985 to adjust currency rates were largely responsible for improved economic conditions today. At that time, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its four major trading partners agreed to devalue the dollar to help reduce the spiraling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit and stave off protectionist legislation. Last year, however, that same group agreed that further declines in the dollar's value would be `` counterproductive.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> noted the most recent March trade figures showed significant improvement, dropping to $ 9.7 billion _ its lowest level in three years _ on the strength of record <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. `` The success -LRB- of the 1985 gathering -RRB- ... created certain momentum that led to further progress,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, pointing to other, subsequent meetings.

 The signing of a two-year contract between <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> union </ORGANIZATION> has one union executive wondering how the company will fare in its new era. `` The test will really come now as to the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> management's ability to manage,'' <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said Monday after the contract was signed at a ceremony. `` It's been somewhat fortunate with a great deal of assistance, from workers, suppliers and from the economy,'' he said. `` ... Now they're on their own.'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> echoed a point made by <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>, who said the signing ceremony never would have been possible without great sacrifice on the part of all involved with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> over the last nine years. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is a good example where cooperation from the plant floor on up contributed immensely'' to saving the company, <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said. Another sign that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is recovered from the financial problems that pushed it toward bankruptcy in 1979 is the realignment of the Chrysler-UAW contract with those at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. The common expiration date of national labor agreements at the Big Three gives the union an advantage in picking a company to target for a pattern agreement. <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers were hurt financially by being out of synch with <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, but under the circumstances, there was no choice. `` Many of the benefits the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers would have gotten had to go by the wayside because we had to work to save the company,'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. `` They are back making profits and they are back on a level playing field as <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> points out. So they can get back to the business of competing,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said the two sides recognize <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s mission. `` I think we all realize we're in a very competitive ball game in the future and that's going to result in good cooperative efforts to make sure we stay in the ball game,'' he said. The agreement covering 66,000 workers took effect May 16 after being approved by just 54 percent of the covered workers. One unit, the skilled trades workers, voted down the agreement, but their objections were dealt with. `` I do n't think we should dwell on the question of percentage,'' <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said. `` It's a question now of what happens from this point forward.'' Chrylser and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> began early negotiations April 18 as a way to calm rising tensions brought on by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s consideration of a $ 2 billion offer for its 28,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary and the company's decision to close a 5,500-worker assembly plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis </LOCATION>. The tentative agreement was reached May 4 and eliminated the possibility of a strike in September, which observers said would have been likely because of the anger of rank-and-file workers over the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> sale and the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> closing. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said the turmoil during negotiations and that 50 percent of the rank and file failed to vote during the ratification process contributed to the low percentage of approval.

 post in the next Cabinet if his party wins the September elections. `` She's been a great minister, one of the best, but she has made one mistake and the opposition could not overlook that,'' he said. `` She is resigning today from the government but she has a lot left to do in politics.'' He appointed Industry Minister <PERSON> Thage </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> to act as justice minister until the election. Mrs. <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> was forced to quit when the small <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which normally supports <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>'s minority government, decided Monday it would join the opposition in a no-confidence vote. Center Party leader <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Johannson </PERSON> said: `` She has n't followed the rules of the game in our democracy. That's why she had to go. It's clear that she broke the code of procedure and went beyond the constitution.'' She was the third justice minister to resign under a cloud since the Social Democrats took office in 1982. <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickbom </PERSON> quit in October after a convicted spy escaped while on an unguarded conjugal furlough from prison. In 1983, <PERSON> Ove </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> resigned for allegedly taking advantage of tax loopholes. Mrs. <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> was the first justice minister who was not a lawyer by training, and the first woman to hold the job. She favored tougher punishments for criminals and took a strong stand against terrorism.
