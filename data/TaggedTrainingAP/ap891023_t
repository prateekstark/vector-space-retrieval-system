 A suspect in a drug investigation was shot to death in Rockefeller Center by federal agents Monday after a drug buy went sour and the man drove off, dragging an agent down the street, authorities said. The <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent, who rolled off the car before it crashed into the back of a bus, suffered minor injuries, officials said. No one else was hurt. The violence occurred around 7 p.m. on 50th Street in Rockefeller Center, an area popular with tourists. More than 100 people watched as the suspect was handcuffed, then treated for a chest wound on the ground next to the car. The suspect was dead when taken to <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said hospital administrator <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schectman </PERSON>. The man was not immediately identified. According to <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, another undercover agent had arranged to buy 4 pounds of pure cocaine from the suspect. Once the agent saw the cocaine, a signal was given and other officers approached the car to arrest the man, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. As they identified themselves, the suspect drove off, she said. An agent got caught in the car and was dragged along for about 100 feet. The agent fired two shots and rolled off the car into the street as another agent fired at least one shot, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. The suspect was not armed, officials said.

 A physician recommended for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Surgeon General's post says the nation must begin thinking about AIDS as a disease that strikes whole families, not just adults. `` We have to think of the children who will be sick,'' Dr. <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Novello </PERSON> said Monday. `` ... we also have to think of the children who will be orphaned when the parents die. It's a family context. If we think of AIDS in a family context, I think we will be much more forceful.'' <PERSON> Novello </PERSON>, 45, has been recommended by Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, to succeed Dr. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> as surgeon general. She is deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Novello </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, has yet to be nominated by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. She spoke to about 500 people from 15 states attending a symposium on health career opportunities for Hispanics. The fact that she has been recommended for the job, <PERSON> Novello </PERSON> said, sends a message that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is interested in recruiting minorities for powerful positions. `` It's an honor for me, and for being Hispanic and for being a woman,'' she said at a news conference. <PERSON> Novello </PERSON>, who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Pediatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for AIDS, said health officials must obtain the `` true number'' of children infected with the HIV virus. The HIV virus causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The task force estimates that by 1991, 10,000 to 20,000 children will be infected with the virus, and 3,000 youngsters will have the disease. `` However, it is feasible to believe that there are many more children infected,'' she said, adding that not all infected children have been tested.

 A young man panicked and buried a friend in his parents' back yard after the friend died in his car, then agonized for a week before telling his mother, police said Monday. An autopsy was conducted on the body of <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gierasch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gierasch </PERSON> said there would be no decision on whether to charge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Montheard </PERSON>, a 24-year-old house painter from <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, until <PERSON> Montheard </PERSON> had been interviewed and autopsy results were in. `` So far everything he has told us seems to be holding up,'' <PERSON> Gierasch </PERSON> said. The death and burial came to light Sunday night, when <PERSON> Montheard </PERSON> telephoned his mother, <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckstein </PERSON>, said the family attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Montheard </PERSON> told her he had buried <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> in her back yard in this <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> city of about 15,000 people 65 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The police were notified and they found <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON>'s body in a 3-foot-deep grave covered with leaves behind the <PERSON> Eckstein </PERSON> home. According to <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> fell asleep in <LOCATION> Montheard </LOCATION>'s car when they went out with another friend after work Oct. 13. <PERSON> Montheard </PERSON> and the other friend left <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> alone in the car for a little while, <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON> said. When they returned, they found him dead. `` He apparently had vomited and became asphyxiated on his own vomit,'' <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Montheard </PERSON> and the friend, who has not been identified by <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON> or police, threw a blanket over <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON>'s body, drove to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> early the next morning, and buried it in his mother and stepfather's yard. If <PERSON> Montheard </PERSON>'s story holds up, the only charge he could possibly face would be unlawful disposal of a body, a misdemeanor violation of state health law, <PERSON> Gierasch </PERSON> said.

 `` Every time I kiss my wife and little boy goodbye, I hold them a little longer and little tighter,'' a reporter says. In the last eight years, 45 employees of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s news media have been murdered, eight since the government war on cocaine cartels began nine weeks ago. Drug gangs have blown up two newspapers and tried to bomb two radio stations. Every day, in print and on the air, the traffickers are faced with tough editorials and reports of police or army raids on their ranches, arrests, destruction of cocaine labs and, by their side, assassinations and bombings. In the forefront of the battle has been the 102-year-old <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>, whose publisher, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, was killed by the drug lords two years ago. The paper called <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s congress a pack of cowards this month because some members favored negotiations with the traffickers and opposed extraditing Colombians to face narcotics charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A car bomb exploded outside the paper's office Sept. 2, causing $ 2.5 million in damage and nearly causing it to close. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, brother of the slain publisher, said last week newspapers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries had offered $ 1 million in aid. He said <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Espectador </PERSON> would not take gifts, but would accept the money as a 15-year loan free of interest. Drug traffickers realize murder and bombing wo n't silence <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION>, and they have begun threatening advertisers, <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said, causing a decline in advertising volume of 25-30 percent. `` The threats keep coming by telephone,'' he said, and many of <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,200 workers say they have been threatened with death. Gunmen on a motorcycle killed two employes Oct. 10 in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, base of the most notorious cartel. The paper closed its <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> offices and <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said distribution there became impossible because of threats to delivery boys, drivers of delivery trucks and even newsstands. `` It unnerves me every time I hear a motorcycle come up behind me,'' an <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> columnist said. Assassins riding double on motorcycles are a favorite weapon of the traffickers, but one <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> reporter was killed by gunmen who burst into his home, and a radio reporter was shot down by killers waiting in shadows outside his house. <ORGANIZATION> Vanguardia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper in the northwestern city of <LOCATION> Bucaramanga </LOCATION>, also has been a target. A car bomb exploded outside its plant Oct. 16, destroying 80 percent of the facilities and killing four people. It published a slim edition the next day, including news of the drug war. Executive editor <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION>, the main competitor of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION>, said: `` I'm afraid there will be dark days for another two years. Never in the history of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has there been such a dangerous and grave threat as the press is suffering through now.'' <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> worked for <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> when its plant and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION>'s were burned in 1948, at the beginning of a civil war that lasted seven years and took 250,000 lives A military dictator seized both papers in 1955 when they refused to submit material to military censors or stop publishing stories about demonstrations agaist the regime. Of the threat from drug traffickers, <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said: `` It is awful, not knowing where the enemy is. No one knows when, how or where they might strike.'' <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON>, yet to be attacked, carries front-page stories daily about the anti-drug war and has published editorials encouraging the government. At least eight leading journalists have left the country because of threats from the traffickers. Among them are two <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> graduates associated with <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> _ part-owner <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Samper </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizano </PERSON>, who led the investigative reporting team, and managing editor <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, son of publisher <PERSON> Hernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. Others who have left are <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguire </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundo </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Ligia </PERSON> <PERSON> Riveros </PERSON> of the weekly news magazine <ORGANIZATION> Cromos </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, director of the TV news program `` 24 Hours,'' and <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, director of the program `` 7 o'clock News.'' Many who remain tell of looking over their shoulders constantly while walking on the street, keeping an eye on the rear view mirror while driving, in case a motorcycle approaches, and wondering whether someone is waiting when they arrive home. Some threats are telephoned to wives. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reporter's wife said she and her 10-year-old son have been threatened several times and she worries every day _ especially if the school bus bringing him home is a bit late, because three schools have been bombed. She does not let her son play outside, movies are out because a bomb went off in a theater, and there have been no trips to shopping centers since a car bomb was found and defused outside the city's largest one. The family stocks up on groceries to reduce the number of trips to supermarkets, several of which have been bombed. They gave up eating out because a bomb wrecked a restaurant, and fear of the darkened streets in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, a city of 6 million people, has nearly ended their social life. `` I hear a motorcycle or a car slowing down as it goes by the house and I wonder if this is it,'' the reporter's wife said. Since the crackdown began, 164 bombs have killed 16 people and wounded 195. `` I think about how easy it would be to throw one through our windows,'' she said.

<HEAD>Abortion Bill Veto Keeps Issue Alive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of a bill expanding federally financed abortions promises to keep alive an emotional issue Republican candidates suddenly wish would fade away before this fall's off-year elections. In races for governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and for mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Republican candidates are doing their best to keep the debate away from abortion, an issue that now appears to be helping their Democratic opponents. `` There's no question this is going to hurt the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., said after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto Saturday `` The issue is very much alive in the country. This is an issue that threatens to divide the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> coalition,'' added <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>. Lawmakers and lobbyists who back abortion rights see little hope of overriding the veto, but they say they will mount an effort in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> anyway. `` Clearly we'll try to override. Clearly, that's probably not going to happen, so he wins,'' a disheartened Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., said after Saturday's veto The abortion funding expansion was attached to a $ 157 billion spending bill. <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>'' show that if the override fails, lawmakers should pass the spending bill again and send it back to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The bill <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed Saturday had passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by a decisive 67-31 margin, but it squeaked through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> 216-206, far short of the two-thirds vote necessary for an override. The measure, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week despite his pledge to veto it, would permit poor women who are victims of rape and incest to obtain abortions paid by Medicaid. That covers a relatively small group, by most estimates. Yet its passage, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s public anguish before announcing his veto plans, have given it broader symbolic importance while compounding difficulty for right-to-life candidates who find polls shifting against them. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, Republican <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> has been accused of waffling on abortion and trails Democrat <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> has tried to push the campaign onto the issues of crime, drugs, taxes and automobile insurance. `` We would prefer the race to be fought on other, traditional issues,'' says <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>'s campaign manager. In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> won the Republican primary with a tough anti-abortion position but has been pounded for that position by Democrat <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, who reversed a deficit in published polls while his abortion-rights ads were running. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> responded by attacking <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s character and past record on crime. `` It's our responsibility to get another issue out there, and that's what you'll see from <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have to demonstrate very clearly that abortion is an issue but it is not the only issue,'' adds <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildebrand </PERSON>, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s press secretary National Republican strategists acknowledge privately, however, that the abortion issue is proving a problem for some of their candidates who have staked out firm anti-abortion stands. While that once seemed a safe political position, polls show <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidates are losing some voters because of the abortion issue _ primarily younger voters and women. The equation changed with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision last summer giving states more room to regulate abortions. That gave the issue increased relevance and raised the prospect in voters' minds that abortion rights could be restricted. `` In order to retrieve the Republican female vote, which we are losing, we have to focus on other issues that voters care about _ like child care, the environment,'' said one Republican strategist, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. These Republicans hope that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto on the Medicaid abortion bill wo n't be seen by most voters in state and congressional races as directly relevant to the question of maintaining abortion rights. But they acknowledge that to the extent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto keeps public attention focused on abortion, it can impede their candidates' efforts to move the public debate to other issues

 The Monitor, the ironclad Civil War ship that sank in a gale after a celebrated battle with the <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> ship Merrimack 127 years ago, still finds itself surrounded by turbulence. The government's refusal for safety reasons to allow anyone to dive to the ironclad Monitor's watery grave for the last 10 years has angered divers, who believe the ship is on the verge of collapsing. If that happens, it will be the end of part of our `` national heritage,'' a divers' lobbying group said last week. `` Underlying this controversy is how far the government should go to protect the individual from undertaking a somewhat dangerous activity,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scuba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Photographing the Monitor has become an obsession for marine explorer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, who has enlisted the aid of his congressman and fellow scuba enthusiasts to help him get permission for the dive. In the last five years, <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said he has filed 11 permit applications and written 51 letters to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the wreck 16 miles off the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION> coast in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, who said his quest has cost him thousands of dollars, has begun filing federal Freedom of Information Act requests to try to obtain information from <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> that he believes will not be forthcoming any other way. Last week he sat through a daylong hearing before a <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> administrative law judge who considered previous denials of three of his requests _ each varying slightly _ to make the 220-foot dive using scuba gear. The judge will study the case further before making a recommendation to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a branch of <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>. `` The problem is bureaucratic territoriality,'' <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said in an interview after the hearing. `` <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> wants to preserve the wreck for themselves.'' The currents and weather can change quickly in the area where the Monitor went down. `` They do n't call that ` The Graveyard of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>' for nothing,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dane </PERSON> <PERSON> Konop </PERSON>, who has been to the site. `` It's a very tricky situation out there, the most dangerous conditions imaginable.'' <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>'s attorney, fellow diver <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, noted at the hearing that <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> allowed <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> explorer <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON>'s party to dive to the Monitor in 1979. <ORGANIZATION> Cousteau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazeau </PERSON> said last week that the weather and the visibility on the trip was poor, and that little or no usable footage was produced. `` No one has dove on that site since,'' <PERSON> Konop </PERSON> said. `` You can say <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> learned its lesson from the <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> dive. They were happy to make it back aboard safely.'' <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> now considers the dive too deep and dangerous to be made using the compressed air that <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON>'s group used and that <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> proposes, <PERSON> Konop </PERSON> said. At certain depths, nitrogen in the air can cause divers to lose concentration or impede motor skills. But <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said he has made many deeper dives on scuba, including 24 expeditions to the 33-year-old wreck of the <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Doria </PERSON>, off <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> has now applied to make the dive using a mixture of oxygen and helium, a combination that is more expensive than compressed air but which he hopes <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> will find more acceptable. That request is still pending. `` Anyone who has put this much blood and sweat into it, it would be terrific if he could meet <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>'s conditions,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCoursey </PERSON>, spokesman for Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Borski </PERSON>, D-Pa., who has been trying to speed up the administration's consideration of <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>'s A Union ship, the 172-foot Monitor was built with iron. Both the Monitor and the <LOCATION> Merrimack </LOCATION> survived their famous battle in 1862, but neither stayed around long. The Monitor sank in bad weather, and the <LOCATION> Merrimack </LOCATION>, renamed the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, was destroyed by its crew to keep it from being captured by the Union. In 1987, <PERSON> Konop </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> officials journeyed to the Monitor site and returned with photographs and measurements obtained from a remote device they sent into the water. Based partly on <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>'s own statements, <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> and his attorney said they fear the ship is collapsing. <PERSON> Konop </PERSON> conceded the ship's situation is `` dynamic,'' but said, `` I've never seen anything from us that says it's in imminent danger of collapsing on itself.'' <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said he wants to capture the ship on film from an artist's perspective. `` <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> got a fantastic amount of information, but there's no human interest in it. I want something people can relate to. It should be photographed before it collapses,'' he said.

<HEAD>Consumer Food Prices May Moderate in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 No flat predictions yet, but one of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief grocery-watchers thinks consumer food prices in 1990 wo n't go up as fast as they did this year. Food prices did rise sharply in 1989, an average of `` around 6 percent'' over the calendar year, economist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says, adding that not much is in the works over the next couple of months that will alter that preliminary reading. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> records based on official <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statistics, this year's 6 percent all-food increase _ which includes meals eaten out as well as at home _ is the biggest gain since a 7.8 percent jump in 1981. Retail food prices averaged 4.1 percent higher in each of the last two years and had hovered at or below that level since the hefty 1981 increase. Parlett, interviewed by telephone last Friday, said he was in the midst of preparing the 1990 forecast for release at the department's annual outlook conference in late November. `` I do n't think there'll be the increase we've seen this year,'' Parlett ventured. `` It's not going to be near the 6 percent level ... I do n't think.'' Although <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said the 1990 food outlook is still a bit cloudy, there are some points that can be made about this year's situation and how those might bear on the immediate future `` Some of our price increase this year was caused early on by bad weather, with vegetables, particularly,'' he said. `` We do n't forecast bad weather for 1990, so maybe that's one thing that wo n't happen, hopefully <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> added: `` But we still have the carryover from the -LRB- 1988 -RRB- drought that left a lot of pipelines empty, in terms of the processed vegetable market. Prices will be high, and supplies are still going to be tight.'' Despite `` a respectable harvest'' of vegetables this year, supplies for processing will be tight as inventories continue to be replenished, he said. But this will gradually be corrected. `` Come next year there's no reason to see those vegetable prices _ processed or fresh _ to be screaming higher,'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said. Meat, poultry, fish and eggs account for more than 30 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s food-at-home price index, based on December 1988 computations. By comparison, cereals and bakery products are about 14 percent of the index; dairy products, 12 percent; fresh fruits and vegetables, 11 percent; and processed fruits and vegetables, 7 percent. `` The big story really is in poultry,'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said. `` Demand for poultry is n't going to change considerably, but -LRB- producers -RRB- have continued to increase production. So, I would expect some decrease in poultry prices. We've already seen them start coming down from June.'' Red meat supplies, mostly beef and pork, probably will decrease slightly in 1990, he said. But there is uncertainty about what will happen to prices, partly because poultry has an impact on beef and pork, and vice versa. Last week <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON>'s agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said that the farm price of milk has risen sharply this year, meaning that consumers will also see `` brisk'' increases, including cheese and non-fat dry milk. `` For the first time in many years, rises in retail dairy prices will surpass those of all-food or all -LRB- consumer -RRB- items,'' the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> said that from 1975 until 1982, consumer prices for dairy products climbed at about the same rate as milk prices. Since 1982, federal milk supports have dropped more than 23 percent and `` farm milk prices also declined over the same period of time,'' the federation said in a recent newsletter. `` Consumers pay when farm milk prices go up, but they have not reaped the expected benefits when farm prices decline,'' it said. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report last week noted that consumer food prices overall rose a moderate 0.2 percent in September after rising sharply earlier in the year. Food and beverage prices shot up at a 9.3 percent annual rate through May, but from June to September climbed at only a 1.7 percent rate. But the price index for dairy products rose faster than the general tide, jumping 1.4 percent in September, the largest monthly increase since May 1980. <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has been forecasting retail dairy prices rising around 6 percent this year, compared with a 2.4 percent increase in 1988 _ when overall food prices rose 4.1 percent.

 The American soldiers who invaded <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> six years ago are rightly hailed as heroes but the official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rationale for the mission was bogus, says a British officer involved in the attack. Retired Maj. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkin </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action was not necessary to save the lives of American medical students on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island, as claimed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, and in fact endangered them. He also says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers succeeded despite weak advance planning and haphazard coordination by leaders of the different military services involved. <PERSON> Adkin </PERSON>, who took part in the invasion as <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> operations staff officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Barbados </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, recounts the mission in a new book titled `` Urgent Fury: The Battle for <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>.'' He lauds the outcome of the invasion, which occurred six years ago this week, and says it prevented <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> from becoming a `` communist bastion'' in the region. But he dismisses <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims at the time that the 700 American medical students on the island were in danger of being taken hostage. Then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> repeatedly said the 6,000 combat troops staged a `` rescue mission'' on Oct. 25, 1983, to prevent the students from being taken hostage by a radical Marxist government. If anything, <PERSON> Adkin </PERSON> says, the invasion increased the chances that the students would be taken hostage. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were in no danger until the operation was launched,'' he writes. `` The assault on the island could easily have precipitated the taking of hostages by desperate men driven to desperate means to save their own lives.'' The administration decided to intervene in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> `` on the basis of seizing a fleeting strategic-political advantage, which had the added merit that inevitable military success would raise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flagging morale,'' he says. The predawn attack by combined elite units of all the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces came days after leftists on the island executed Marxist Prime Minister <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and imposed a 24-hour curfew. The invasion forces ousted the leftists and flew the students home. A former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official, <PERSON> Langhorne </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Motley </PERSON>, disputes <PERSON> Adkin </PERSON>'s claims about the students, saying: `` He's totally incorrect. <PERSON> Motley </PERSON>, a former assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, said a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officer spoke with the students before the troops arrived and `` they were concerned'' about being taken hostage. Regardless of the reason for the mission, <PERSON> Adkin </PERSON> says, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops deserved the heroes' welcome they received from both the islanders and the American public upon their return. `` The people who had been invaded welcomed the invaders, regarded them as liberators, even going so far as to want <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to remain far longer than they did. The island was to be a communist bastion, an ever more menacing reminder to the rest of the region that their way of live was threatened,'' he says. `` This is what it would have become. That it did not was because President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acted, albeit primarily for reasons of national self-interest.'' Nineteen American soldiers died in the initial assault and several days of skirmishes. <PERSON> Adkin </PERSON> says two <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> also died when their parachutes failed to open. He argues that the American soldiers had to overcome a lack of intelligence information on the island and poor preparation for the joint operation. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military has done its own assessments on <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, finding fault with the lack of coordination and intelligence. Many details of those assessments remain classified, however. A retired <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officer, who served in the planning and execution of the <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> invasion, acknowledged some problems but said <PERSON> Adkin </PERSON> `` does n't tell the whole story.'' The officer, who spoke only on condition he not be further identified, agreed that the troops operated without maps and up-to-date intelligence information but said <PERSON> Adkin </PERSON> should have noted that `` a lot of decisions were made on the ground by ground commanders. They were able to adapt.'' However, he agreed that the various armed forces were ill-prepared to work together and said the decision to use a combined force at that time was wrong. The <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> operation later was cited by Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, as the main reason for a 1986 bill mandating a joint special operations command. `` That it succeeded as it did, without costly setbacks, was due primarily to incredibly good fortune,'' <PERSON> Adkin </PERSON> says. Still, he concludes that `` for all the errors, for all the confusion, for all the suffering, <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> and its people remain grateful to those bold enough to launch the operation and those bold enough to undertake it.''

<TEXT>
 An exhibit of sexually explicit photographs that ignited a debate over government funding of the arts got mixed reviews from an overflow crowd, as it was denounced by a small band of protesters. The exhibit of photos by the late <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> opened Saturday at the <LOCATION> Wadsworth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atheneum </LOCATION>. The collection includes photos of homosexual acts as well as more conventional nudes, celebrity portraits and still lifes of flowers. About 15 religious activists picketed, denouncing the exhibit as `` gay pornography,'' but the line of patrons extended out the door. Officials said 2,000 people paid to see the show, more than four times the usual Saturday attendance. `` The overall quality was superb,'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cemino </PERSON> said as she left the museum. `` There was really nothing obscene about it. The flowers are really beautiful.'' Conservatives in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, led by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, were angered to learn that the <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> exhibit at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Corcoran Gallery of Art originally was funded in part by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month defeated a <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> proposal to ban federal funding of art considered `` obscene'' or `` indecent.'' Instead, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted to bar government financing of works that `` may be obscene'' and lack `` serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value'' _ the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1973 guideline on obscenity. The exhibit had opened to large crowds and critical acclaim in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> before its stormy stop in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Atheneum Director <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaughey </PERSON> said he was happy to show the photos because an art museum `` must n't just lie back and sit like a tabby cat.'' He said the turnout challenged `` the outsider's view of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> _ that it's the insurance capital, that it's staid The <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> museum charged a special $ 3 admission fee to offset the cost of showing it and required that minors be accompanied by an adult. Demonstrators carried signs that read, `` Promote True Art, Not Obscenity,'' and `` Federally Funded Gay Pornography.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressamarita </PERSON>, who has helped defeat gay rights bills in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and fought topless bars, said the exhibit contained `` a lot of beautiful pictures'' along with `` absolute pornography.'' The protest drew a counter-demonstration from two men, who embraced and kissed on the lips for several minutes in front of the protesters. `` Oh my God!'' screamed one demonstrator. `` Are they crazy?'' Inside, during a panel discussion, art critic <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> defended the artist, telling an audience of about 300 that the photos contain nothing new. `` Those of you who have squinted hard at the dirty Greek vases in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> know what I'm talking about,'' he said. `` What is the big deal?''

 Rescuers euphoric over finding a survivor in a collapsed freeway had to suspend their search late Sunday because the rubble became so unstable, and earthquake-shaken Northern Californians mapped strategy for Monday's commute through `` gridlock.'' Authorities sent crews home for the night because so much further damage had been done by aftershocks and heavy construction equipment that they had no idea how to safely shore up Interstate 880. Large sections of concrete have crumbled. And there was no estimate of when work could resume. `` It's kind of minute by minute,'' said <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. More than 100 people were evacuated Sunday afternoon from an <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> housing project located within 10 feet of a four-block stretch of I-880 abutting the portion that gave way in the quake. The evacuation came after a cement column fell from the structure and new cracks were discovered in the section of double-deck freeway that had previously been thought to be stable. Longshoreman Buck Helm, who spent four days in a tomb of I-880 concrete and steel, was in critical-stable condition at <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> with some slight improvement, hospital officials said. Engineer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON>, hailed as a hero of the rescue, said he was checking the fallen double-deck freeway for stability on Saturday when he spotted the back of <PERSON> Helm </PERSON>'s head with his flashlight, and then saw a hand wave at him. `` It stopped my heart. I thought maybe the wind was blowing and that's what caused it. I thought I might be losing it,'' said <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON>, 29. The number of dead pulled from the I-880 disaster rose to 38, including a 4-year-old boy, bringing the earthquake's toll to 59, with thousands injured and homeless and dozens still missing. `` We know there are more victims, more cars. But we do n't know how many,'' said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol Capt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Garver </PERSON>. Damage estimates topped $ 7 billion, making the quake the costliest natural disaster in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. Baseball commissioner <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> announced Sunday that the World Series would not resume until Friday night, three days later than originally hoped. The championship between the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION>'s and the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> was suspended the night of the quake. Sunday was a day for both mourning the dead and giving thanks for the living at churches across the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. Special services were set because some damaged churches remain too dangerous, and congregants praying for peace with the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> were encouraged to share their quake experiences. `` By the uncertainties of this hour, we pray to be spared from further suffering,'' Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> told 700 people at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> here. `` We pray that we may be spared further earthquakes,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. `` We pray for all those who have suffered heavy losses. I weep for the parents, for the elderly, for the children. I pray for the relief of suffering and anxiety. I can not forget to pray for the dead and the bereaved.'' In <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, parishioners of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> had to move services to a Baptist church because the cathedral's tower was filled with cracks and leaning precariously `` Sometimes in life, God shakes us and says, ` Pay attention, there is something more important than the ordinary things in your life,''' Father <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said. `` It was n't just the ground that shook Tuesday, the earthquake shook a lot of things that we do _ the ordinary things on our agenda,'' <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said. Phone calls, telegrams and bouquets of flowers for Helm, the burly longshoreman, deluged Highland General Hospital Sunday. Helm regained some function in his kidneys, damaged by severe dehydration, and his lung condition improved slightly, Dr. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Fry </PERSON> said. He was still in the intensive care unit being fed through a tube, and still was having difficulty moving his left leg. `` He is not out of the woods yet,'' Fry said. A non-smoker, Helm had high blood pressure and mild diabetes that did not require insulin before the earthquake. `` I think it's more amazing that he has been able to come through as well as he has despite those medical problems,'' Fry said. `` He's proven that he has a strong will to live.'' Crews sawed the fallen five-lane section of the upper deck of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> in half and lifted one section down to a barge for repairs Sunday. A barge floating on chopping <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> is supporting a towering white crane capable of lifting the 100-ton separate sections of roadway that collapsed in the earthquake, killing a woman who drove her car into the gap. The vital link between <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> is expected to be closed for four weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday reported major cracks in three dams within 5 miles of the epicenter _ <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Elsman </PERSON> _ but said they posed `` no public threat at this time'' because water is low behind them. At the I-880 rescue site in industrial downtown <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, six sweeps of the area where Helm was found with sniffing dogs and electronic gear turned up no signs of other survivors. Digging to remove cars and bodies was delayed because the double-deck freeway, which collapsed on top of itself, shifted under the strains of aftershocks, wind and even the rescue work itself. Workers placed giant airbags, hydraulic jacks and wood timbers under concrete sections, and used truckloads of dirt to build a sturdier foundation, according to <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. They also installed seismic monitors on the structure. `` The problem is we still have to proceed cautiously and deliberately even though people are encouraged,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Drago </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> CalTrans </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Despite the slow pace, rescue workers still had a renewed vigor Sunday. `` We need to use every trick in the rescue books to make sure no one's still up here alive,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromely </PERSON>, a construction worker moving debris. `` We know now that it's possible. We're going as fast as we can.'' A half-dozen impromptu tent cities have sprouted up around <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, the battered, largely Hispanic city south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and closer to the epicenter. Hundreds of residents there are so traumatized by the quake, its aftershocks, which have been both strong and numerous, and the memory of the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> earthquake that they refuse to go indoors. `` This place is a disaster,'' <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Cote </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> human resources agency, said as she tried to coax 50 survivors living in <LOCATION> Calaghan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to move to 22 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> tents erected several blocks away by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are everywhere on the streets in this town.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> opened a permanent tent shelter with large olive-colored military tents in a <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> park Sunday. Throughout the quake area, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said, the population at its 19 shelters dropped to 2,000 Saturday night. It had been above 10,000. In the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, officials were doing everything they could to scare commuters off the streets Monday, the first work day for tens of thousands since Tuesday's quake. Numerous freeways remain closed in addition to the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. An armada of ferries has formed, and transit authorities touted subways and buses as well. Employers were offering flexible work schedules, but with many routes into the Bay area and <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> blocked, the Monday morning forecast called for `` gridlock.'' Driving to work alone amounts to `` an anti-social act,'' said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Diridon </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>.

 The average price of gasoline nationwide dipped about a half-cent a gallon at the pumps in the past two weeks, a survey found. The Lundberg Survey of 12,000 gas stations showed the average retail price of all grades of gasoline, including taxes, at 109.12 cents a gallon on Friday, down .53 cent from Oct. 6, analyst <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said Sunday. `` The movement is not untypical for this type of year. It's partially a response to seasonally lowered demand, but also to ample supplies,'' she said Wholesale prices fell, allowing retailers to pass their savings on to customers, she said. According to the survey, self-service prices per gallon were: regular unleaded, 97.74 cents; premium unleaded, 114.87 cents; regular leaded, 96.62 cents. At full-service pumps, prices per gallon were: regular unleaded, 127.26; premium unleaded, 139.92 cents; regular leaded, 126.01 cents.

 <PERSON> Leta </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> recently joined the ranks of the nation's homeless. She's not a disheveled bag lady with possessions stashed in a supermarket shopping cart. Mrs. <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>'s belongings are strewn on a slope in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, mixed up with the debris of her earthquake-ravaged $ 450,000 house. The split-level, four-bedroom home is now a splintered pile of rubble, rocked off its foundation and tossed 15 feet by the 6.9 magnitude <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area earthquake. Only three huge pine trees prevent the wreckage from sliding down the mountain. `` I realize I'm in a different subset of the population now. Suddenly, I'm a homeless person,'' the 54-year-old dietitian said Sunday, as she and her husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, picked through the debris. `` I slept in my car for two nights. I have a different frame of mind now.'' `` It's kind of like a death in the family,'' <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Greaney </PERSON> said of the loss. <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> adjuster <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Frye </LOCATION> home was the worst she had seen so far, adding that it would take weeks to determine how many homes in the Bay area were destroyed in the quake. `` There are just too many to count,'' she said. The Fryes were paid $ 20,000 on Friday as an advance to their earthquake insurance claim. The couple had argued a year ago over whether to buy insurance and reluctantly paid the $ 440-a-year premium. `` We really debated about it before we signed up. Thank God we did,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>. The couple bought the 22-year-old house five years ago. It's one of 112 houses in the <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estates </LOCATION> area about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and just southwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. `` Many people have come by here and said we have the dubious distinction of having the most destroyed house in the Villa,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> said. `` We've become very popular,'' added <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>. The contents of dressers, cupboards, drawers and desks where strewn about inside the demolished home, and the <ORGANIZATION> Fryes </ORGANIZATION> used a garden rake to fish out mementos and personal items in reach. `` I think everybody around here for two days was on this numb high _ sort of in shock,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> said. When the earthquake struck, Mrs. <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> was driving home in her car and thought the tires had gone flat. Her husband, 57, an executive at <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ordnance </ORGANIZATION>, was in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> on a business trip. `` His first comment was, ` Well, <PERSON> Leta </PERSON>, you wanted to remodel,' `` Mrs. <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> said. `` We had one room we called the T.U.R. _ the torn-up room, which I was going to remodel. Now I call it the T.U.H. _ torn-up house.'' The Fryes, who now are staying in a hotel, say they are uncertain whether they will rebuild on the one-acre site. The 27,750 people living in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION> were still coping Sunday with effects of the quake. Traffic lights were still out, plywood covered many storefront windows, roadblocks remained in the heart of town, and state Highway 17 leading south through the mountains to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> was still closed. A steady procession of trucks carried water into the mountains. The heavily wooded area features a phenomenon unusual in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ noticeable seasons. Fall leaves have turned orange and have filled the four-inch cracks on the mountain roads throught the region.

By Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which handles travel arrangements for congressional delegations going overseas, said it only had the names of six people who were going. <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, did not respond to calls about the trip Friday. His office refused to release a copy of the invitation he sent to as many as 150 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, or a list of people who planned to attend the long weekend event at <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Half </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the staff director, said a final list of participants probably would not be available until takeoff. The purpose of the trip is to try to get lawmakers in touch with a wide variety of people, including academics, union heads and farmers' and labor organizations, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hellinger </PERSON>, co-director of the <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alternative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group that is sponsoring the event, said the seminars and meetings are hard work. The conference should not be considered play even though it is held at a resort, he said. <PERSON> Atherton </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who works with <PERSON> Hellinger </PERSON>, said a number of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had expressed interest in the trip, but his group had `` been asked not to release names, given the whole things with junkets and ethics.'' The group provided an agenda for the five-day program. After arriving Nov. 2, participants are invited to a reception. A series of speeches and conferences are scheduled for the next two days, generally running from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday is a free day for recreation. On the final day, lawmakers will receive a briefing from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy staff before flying back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The lawmakers will hear from <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s prime minister, before the seminars start. Topics include: `` Narcotics: Toward a new Understanding,'' a panel discussion on `` Structural Adjustment and Debt,'' an open discussion on `` Internal Constraints,'' and a presentation on `` Options and Strategies: Regional Development, Food Security and the Role of Regional Institutions.'' The <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> conference is an outgrowth of two earlier conferences on <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> attended by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> with responsibility for approving members' trips, attended the <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> conference in February 1988 But <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Burris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, said her boss would not travel to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> this year. Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who also traveled to <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, declined the trip because of the upcoming <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mayoral race, according to his assistant, <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackey </PERSON>. Among those who intend on taking the trip are Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, R-Minn., and <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuster </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s delegate in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, their aides said <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION>' subcommittee on trade, which had jurisdiction over the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> Initiative, a stalled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> development plan for the region. He is also a co-chairman of Friends of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, a loosely knit task force on the region. Both groups, as well as the subcommittee on the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, are expected to send members to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the results of the <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> conference have already borne fruit: <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> introduced a $ 93 million <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> aid package which has passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government picks up the cost of travel and pays a per diem for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the Development GAP raised money for the conference, <PERSON> Hellinger </PERSON> said. Sources include foundations, like the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and private contributions from grassroots groups, such as churches, he said.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> says <PERSON> God </PERSON> has forgiven him for his sins, but his lawyer is afraid the TV evangelist will have a tougher time setting things straight with a no-nonsense federal judge they call `` Maximum Bob.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could be sent to prison for 120 years and fined more than $ 5.2 million when he goes before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> on Tuesday for sentencing for fraud and conspiracy. `` Maximum <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> will probably knock a year off the maximum,'' defense attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> joked ruefully. The judge lived up to his moniker last month when he sentenced former <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> to 18 years and five months in prison for tax evasion. `` One can only speculate <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> will get a heavier sentence than <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> _ it's a foregone conclusion,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> also was fined $ 500,000. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said prosecutors will ask for a prison sentence, but he refused to elaborate. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> also declined to say if the government will ask that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> be taken into custody immediately after sentencing; prosecutors unsuccessfully tried to jail him after his conviction. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, 49, was convicted Oct. 5 on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy for overselling $ 158 million in lifetime vacations, or `` partnerships,'' at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s resort hotels. The jury found that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> used more than $ 3.7 million to buy luxurious homes, fancy cars, jewelry and expensive vacations. The six-week trial was briefly interrupted by <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s commitment to a mental hospital after a breakdown `` God has forgiven me for my sins,'' he told followers from the pulpit last week at his <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` I'm not guilty. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, were convicted of diverting more than $ 1.1 milion in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money for their own use and cheating the government out of $ 525,000 in taxes. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> drew the maximum prison term _ 17 years and nine months _ and was fined $ 500,000.

Before sentencing the Taggarts, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said he thought they had lied on the stand. But <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> gave former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> eight years out of a possible 10 after <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> pleaded guilty, apologized and agreed to testify for the government.

<TEXT>
 A centuries-old tradition of opium poppy cultivation in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has blossomed into a major heroin industry during a decade of political turmoil in <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. It has spawned what many anxious Pakistanis call a `` heroin and Kalashnikov culture'' of crime, referring to the preferred automatic weapon of the region's drug lords. Most of the brightly colored poppies are grown in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where 11 years of civil war have precluded any attempt to control their cultivation. Officials say the flowers' sticky yield of opium is refined into heroin powder in makeshift laboratories along the rugged Pakistan-Afghan frontier. It is then spirited through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to markets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Western narcotics agents estimate that up to 80 percent of the heroin sold in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and 25 percent sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> comes from the so-called `` Golden Crescent'' region of <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The remainder comes from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s `` Golden Triangle,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources say. Pakistani officials say it's hard to estimate how much of the drug passes through their country. <PERSON> Khalim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dilkhan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said that in 1988 alone local agents seized 13,670 pounds of heroin, compared with 950 pounds seized in 1980. He said heroin addiction was virtually unknown in this Moslem country of 109 million people 10 years ago but now more than one million mostly poor, urban Pakistanis are hooked. Their preferred method of using the drug is to smoke it, whereas most addicts in the West inject heroin. `` In 10 years, the problem has multiplied a thousand times,'' <PERSON> Dilkhan </PERSON> said. There are no statistics on addicts in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Poppy cultivation has declined steadily in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, but it has risen sharply in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where fighting between the Marxist government and Moslem rebels has turned tribal areas along the mountainous Afghan-Pakistan frontier into a haven for drug lords, <PERSON> Dilkhan </PERSON> said. He said opium production in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was about 140 tons in 1988, down from nearly 990 tons in 1980. In <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, this year's yield will be anywhere from 935 to 2,200 tons, Pakistani and Western narcotics experts estimate Opium production, and to some extent export, have existed for centuries in both countries but experts say three major events in 1979 combined to help build the multimillion-dollar heroin industry: _ The <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> government's crackdown on heroin labs in eastern <LOCATION> Anatolia </LOCATION>, forcing production into western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. _ <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic revolution, which ousted the <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>'s government and purged corrupt officials who secretly participated in the opium trade. _ The war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which began after a Soviet-supported communist coup in 1978 and has hindered efforts to control poppy cultivation. Opium production declined in the first years following the 1979 Soviet military intervention but increased steadily in the mid-1980s, experts say. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which together with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> backs <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s anti-communist rebels, has only recently started working with guerrilla leaders to discourage poppy cultivation. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is mounting a $ 10 million program that over the next three years hopes to promote drug awareness among <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s mujahedeen rebels and offer incentives to substitute the opium poppy with other crops, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say American and Pakistani experts deny reports that the insurgents systematically sell heroin to buy weapons. `` There is no evidence of organized -LRB- heroin -RRB- activity but as individuals, yes, some of them are doing it,'' <PERSON> Dilkhan </PERSON> said of the guerrillas. Experts say that Pak-Afghan heroin follows three routes from the frontier westward: _ Across northern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, then south to <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> for shipping through the Arabian Sea. _ Due south through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s desert province of <LOCATION> Baluchistan </LOCATION>, often by camel or jeep caravan, to the Arabian Sea. _ South to <LOCATION> Baluchistan </LOCATION>, then west through <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The new Pakistani government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who took office after November elections, declared war on heroin traffic. The government has received more than $ 60 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for the effort. <PERSON> Dilkhan </PERSON> says the government campaign focuses on poppy crop substitution, destruction of plantations through aerial spraying, interdiction of overland shipments and drug awareness among the population. Narcotics agents are reluctant to discuss official corruption, which many describe as a main obstacle to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s war on drugs. `` Lets face it, we're talking about huge amounts of money. That attracts corruption,'' said a Pakistani narcotics official, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Dilkhan </PERSON> said police arrested a number of `` mid-level drug barons'' this year but that it was difficult to collect enough evidence to bring them to trial. `` The money factor is tremendous. It's highly profitable,'' he said. Agents say one kilogram -LRB- 2.2 pounds -RRB- of 97 percent pure heroin fetches $ 1,000 at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. `` Multiply that about 100 times for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dilkhan </PERSON> said. Crop substitution is unattractive to most poppy growers because they are accustomed to handsome profits, he says.

<HEAD>Congressional Democrats Regaining Upper Hand Over Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional Democrats _ reeling in disarray just three weeks ago _ are using shrewd legislative maneuvering and a couple of political windfalls to regain the upper hand with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to lawmakers in both parties. The new <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leadership came in for criticism last month, even from their own party operatives, for seeming to be too accommodating with the president. The griping intensified after House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and his team made a high-profile stand against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s capital gains tax cut, and lost. But in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> such conditions are transitory. The past week has seen <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> defeat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration; overwhelming <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval of an aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> that is nearly twice what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants; and a showdown over federal funding for welfare abortions in rape and incest cases. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday vetoed a spending bill that included the abortion funds, and while members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> concede an override attempt probably would not succeed, they are talking of sending the same measure to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> again. `` I think we're back,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership `` Timing, strategy and some luck have added up to our being able to score some points.'' Asked about the Democratic resurgence, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> shrugged. `` It's like a ball game. Some innings you hit well and score runs,'' he said, recalling the `` wave of high popularity'' his party enjoyed a few weeks ago. But the winds have shifted, he acknowledged. `` If they're feeling good about some of the developments in the last day or two, so be it.'' Democrats also seem increasingly emboldened to take <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on directly, particularly for his response to the radical changes taking place in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In a speech last week, Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., concluded: `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appears to be determined to go down in history as the hesitation president At least his first year in office could be titled, ` The Year of Living Timidly.''' The spending bill vetoed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> included money to pay for abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest. The bill would have reversed a decade-old federal policy, a move propelled by resurgent pro-choice forces. But many Republicans are uncomfortable with a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto, fearing it will put them on the losing side of another hot political issue. `` This is just the wrong front on which to fight that battle,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` There's no question this is going to hurt the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., an abortion rights backer, said on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Novak'' show And on the flag issue, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s early endorsement of a constitutional amendment at the Iwo Jima Memorial has proved less than the brilliant stroke it seemed at the time. Democrats' strategy to wait the issue out and evoke the sanctity of the Bill of Rights has been vindicated In fact, it was two last-minute <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> converts _ Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> _ who helped take the amendment down to defeat in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators this week will wrestle with the issue which represented <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s biggest policy victory to date, the cut in the tax rate on capital gains from the sale of holdings like stocks and real estate. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position prevailed in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> three weeks ago, he later lost in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> when it was dropped from an anti-deficit bill. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, has said he does n't think the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will pass a capital gains cut this year, and said it was `` irresponsible'' to be pushing the initiative when what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needs to do is cut the deficit. `` I would like to see the president devote as much time to historic events in Western and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ... I'd like to see him devote a fraction of the time to that, that he is to this capital gains debacle,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also faces a deadline this week to pass a new stopgap spending bill to fund most government programs until the regular money bills can be enacted. The new spending measure will include up to $ 2.5 billion in aid for victims of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake, as well as money for ongoing cleanup following Hurricane Hugo.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics panel should keep looking into Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s ties with a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> businessman, even though the panel's lawyer says further investigation is not needed, a leading House Democrat says. Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> said the ethics panel should send its own staff to investigate <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s contacts with two federal agencies on behalf of real estate developer <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Roush </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> because it `` can not ignore'' an article published this weekend in the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roush </PERSON>, a longtime political patron of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, was among the supporters who raised $ 13,000 for <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> to tour <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1977 for research on a novel. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, a history professor at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at the time, was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the following year and never wrote the book. The article, which was distributed to news organizations by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> chairs, said <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> attempted to intervene with government agencies on behalf of <LOCATION> Roush </LOCATION> projects twice in 1986 _ once with the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and once with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> In both cases, the agencies reaffirmed their decisions denying the relief sought by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> for the <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, businessman. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Galen </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, said he had not read the article and could not comment on the specifics. However, he said it sounded like the article recounted a typical congressman-constituent relationship. `` That's what people in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> do, and they're generally proud of it, helping businessmen in their area wend their way through the labyrinth of the federal bureaucracy,'' <PERSON> Galen </PERSON> said. Last week, the ethics committee's outside counsel concluded there was no basis for opening a formal investigation into charges by another <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Democrat, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> had accused <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of violating <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules and campaign finance laws through the 1977 book partnership involving <PERSON> Roush </PERSON> and another one in 1984. `` Merely reading through documents is not enough,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said in a statement distributed along with the article. `` The committee now needs to send its own staff to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to interview individuals involved.''

 Hundreds of looters and curiosity-seekers overran the wreckage of a Honduran jet crash, hampering efforts to determine the cause of the weekend crash that left 131 dead. `` Everyone trampled everything down,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON>, head of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> team investigating the crash. Honduran officials were unfamiliar with the importance of sealing off a plane crash site, <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON> said Sunday. The TAN-SAHSA <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-200 crashed on approach early Saturday on the last leg of a flight from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> with a stop in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. A survivor said the plane shook violently and seemed to plunge just before it crashed in flames into a hillside. Fifteen of the 146 people aboard, including the pilot, survived. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said 15 Americans were on the plane and three survived. Two were transferred to hospitals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but all three were out of danger, doctors said. <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON> said the looting would not necessarily cripple the investigation, but that evidence had been obscured. `` There are no ground scars that would show the angle the plane hit at, how it broke up and dissipated energy, how it slid,'' he said. The first people to reach the site were peasant farmers, some of whom live in houses only 75 yards away. They helped rescue survivors and rushed them to hospitals in pickup trucks. Within an hour after the plane crashed at 7:50 a.m. Saturday, the site was overrun by more than 100 people sifting through luggage, clothes and papers. Soldiers were seen sorting clothing. Children stuffed toys and clothes into bags. One fireman was observed leaving with a suitcase under his overcoat. Wallets and billfolds also disappeared. Few corpses arrived at the morgue in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> wearing watches. Maj. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Honduran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>' liaison to the investigators, said the site was not secured until Sunday afternoon, almost 36 hours after the crash. Some looters were peasants, who earn about $ 1 a day, but <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> said roads in the area 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> were jammed with curiosity-seekers on Sunday outings. `` There were people hauling out burned suitcases, trying to open melted zippers. I even saw children taking away bits of twisted metal as souvenirs,'' said <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Honduran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who visited the site Sunday. The `` black boxes'' that record pilots' conversations and flight data were found Saturday and sent to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for evaluation, <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said. Hundreds of people gathered at <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>'s morgue as doctors continued the slow task of identifying charred bodies. Speculation on the cause of the crash centered on bad weather along the approach path. <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>'s airport is at the base of a ring of often cloud-covered mountains, as if it were at the bottom of a soup bowl. There was also speculation about the 727's age, more than 20 years, leaving it open to possible metal fatigue, which has affected other older jets. Maj. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguello </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s civil aeronautics, quoted regional air controllers as saying the roof of the plane tore away before the crash. Passenger <PERSON> Evenor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> businessman who was badly burned in the crash, said the plane shook as though from heavy air turbulence and seemed to dive more steeply than normal moments before the crash. `` I was on fire when the plane stopped. I tell you, I thought I was going to die,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials said the plane was sold to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aitlines </ORGANIZATION> in 1968. Continental leased the plane to TAN-SAHSA, according to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, but he did n't know when.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic reformers have vowed to transform socialism into capitalism. So far, Poles are learning one element: poverty. Soup kitchens are opening across the country and the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first food stamp program is being readied as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> prepares to deal for the first time with a problem that officially never existed under Communist ideology With government controls lifted, food prices are up 300, 400 or even 1,200 percent in three months and hunger looms for pensioners and even schoolchildren. There is the new prospect of unemployment as inefficient factories close for lack of government subsidies. When <PERSON> Taduesz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> became the only non-communist prime minister in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, he warned that Poles do not know just how painful it will be to revive the nation's ruined economy. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has practically no sensible social welfare system,'' says Labor Minister <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, a veteran Solidarity activist charged with organizing protection from the worst effects of economic reform. `` Such a system can be introduced but that will take one, two or even three years. Yet people need to be helped right now,'' he said in a recent newspaper interview. `` Local communities must organize themselves for such help. This is where private initiative has an enormous task before it.'' Every day, newspapers carry reports of new soup kitchens opening: In <LOCATION> Tarnow </LOCATION>, 500 people are getting free meals and 100 more will be helped starting Nov. 1; a kitchen has opened in <LOCATION> Rzeszow </LOCATION> and a second is planned a Solidarity chapter in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> is collecting food donations. `` Milk bars used to be the mecca for poor people. But since milk and cottage cheese prices have increased tenfold, many old age pensioners were sentenced to a forced fast,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said in a report on coupons distributed in <LOCATION> Poznan </LOCATION> for free meals at the small seedy restaurants that serve dairy products, eggs, soup and bread, but usually no meat. Up to 4.5 million pensioners, poor children up to age 6 and others will receive coupons good for free milk, bread and cottage cheese when the food stamp program starts in December. A recent state television special showed the homeless under highways, on park benches and in train stations. A shop clerk reported a rise in shoplifting. A divorced woman despaired about how she would provide for her two children now that their kindergarten fees demand nearly half her salary. The irony is not lost on Poles who for decades saw the homeless and unemployed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in television footage backing the official ideology that socialism cares for all and only capitalism breeds poverty. For four decades, the price of food and other basic supplies were kept artificially low by government subsides. Shortages were rampant, but bread, potatoes and milk were very cheap. The burden of those subsidies became clear when the new pro-Solidarity government threw open the account books on a huge budget deficit and began to do battle with deeply rooted waste and inefficiency. `` At least with the new government we are feeling better about ourselves as Poles,'' said an elderly woman waiting at a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> soup kitchen. `` But what can the government do with an empty treasury? We are feeling more free but we can not live on freedom alone. We have to eat something.'' The transition to a market-driven economy from a vast centralized bureaucracy required lifting controls on food prices. The outgoing Communist government took that step on Aug. 1 _ but was criticized for not protecting people whose incomes lagged behind. `` I worked for 30 years in People's <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and I have a pension of 68,000 zlotys -LRB- $ 32 -RRB- a month, which means I ca n't afford anything,'' says a 65-year-old woman named <PERSON> Kristina </PERSON>. She pays 8,000 zlotys a month for her room and that leaves 2,000 zlotys a day for everything else. A half-pound of butter costs 3,800 zlotys, up from 300 zlotys three months ago, and a small loaf of bread is 560 zlotys. Two pounds of pork is out of the question at 15,000 zloty. The woman points to her years-old shoes and the winter coat from her niece. She shrugs. `` I worked as a teacher for so many years and now I ca n't even afford stockings for the winter,'' said another woman. She was among the mostly elderly people bowed over bowls of potato soup and bread at a <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> kitchen in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> that opened last month and serves 300 free meals a day. Since late September, the organization has opened soup kitchens in 20 of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 49 provinces, said <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Kukla </PERSON>, deputy directory of social assistance. She said poverty has increased sharply since August, when the new government took office: `` We are sure that for some people, this is the only meal they have.'' In <LOCATION> Lublin </LOCATION>, 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, 340 people a day are served soups and dumplings in a small basement kitchen run by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Church-linked Brother <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Society </PERSON>. Organized to help alcoholics and the mentally ill, the society has now found many others in need, said the Rev. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON>. `` The number of people coming here has doubled since June. They are normal people, made helpless as a result of the current situation,'' said <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON>. Among them are disabled children from a government institution that can not afford to feed them lunch, he said. The society runs a shelter for 30 homeless women and hopes to open one for men soon. Plans also include a free health clinic and a telephone `` help'' line _ all common elements of Western philanthropy virtually unheard of in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

 Buzz <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON>, the second man to walk on the moon, wants non-astronauts such as teachers, writers or singers in space. `` The space program does n't belong to just those in the space business,'' he said. `` It's something that requires the support of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. It belongs to them and I think we have to begin to make that accessible.'' He made his comments Saturday at a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> as the space shuttle Atlantis was in the midst of its mission, which included deployment of the nuclear-powered <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> suspended its program to send private citizens in space following the 1986 Challenger space shuttle tragedy that killed <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> teacher <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> and six other crew members. <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> said it was time to restart the program. Professional astronauts `` are talented in commanding spacecraft or controlling them or understanding the technical contributions ... but we're not necessarily that talented in being able to convey the philosophy of what the meaning of this is, what the beauty of this is because that's not our expertise.'' He said it would be wise to take a cue from the ancients, who passed on stories through songs and myths. `` In modern days, you put it to some sort of a catchy tune,'' he said. `` You send a silver-tongued journalist up there and he is going to write something and we'll read it or he will say something and we'll listen to it, but we're not going to play it over and over again'' as we would a song. <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON>, 59, also criticized <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> in general for what he called its `` lack of foresight.'' He applauded President's <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for Americans to return to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and head to Mars, but questioned whether <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> was ready to set in motion those ideals. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be planning spaceports and transportation depots for interplanetary travel, which could be used with smaller rockets and less fuel, instead of launching huge payloads, which require large, expensive rockets.

 Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, the courtly chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is considering ending his 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> career but Democrats say they are `` pushing him hard'' to run for re-election. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> will be 71 next month and these Democrats say he has every right to retire. But they also say his decision to step aside would make the 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race highly competitive, perhaps leaving an otherwise virtually safe seat vulnerable to a strong Republican drive. Republicans say that if the veteran <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> senator does retire there is a better-than-even chance that Rep. <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, the almost-certain <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate, can prevail, spurring the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s drive to regain the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority it lost in 1986. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and his own colleagues are pushing him hard to run,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> source close to <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, adding that one of those doing some gentle pushing is <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` We are telling him, ` We need you, we want you, you are an important part of this body,''' said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, communications director for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Senator <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> has said he is undecided; there is every indication that he has not made up his mind,'' she said. `` I think his colleagues would clearly like him to run.'' `` I think it's a blow if he does n't run,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., a former chairman of the Democratic campaign committee <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said that is because <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> is widely regarded as all but certain to retain his seat if he does seek a fifth six-year term. `` But it's really his choice,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. `` It's a very personal thing and it's hard for the committee to intrude; it's hard for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> to intrude. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> has done no fundraising, leaving the strong impression he will choose to retire. He has repeatedly told associates he is genuinely undecided but that he will announce a decision, possibly by mid-November. `` I will make my views known at an appropriate time,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> says when asked the question directly. `` He's clearly considering stepping down and is looking for alternative ways to pursue his foreign policy interests,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., the senator <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> succeeded as chairman <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> has much to ponder. He will be 72 shortly after the 1990 elections, 78 at the end of a new six-year term. In <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> has two conflicting precedents to follow. He holds the seat vacated by Sen. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, who was 92 when he retired. But <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> has often quoted, with apparent approval, the line used by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastore </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, when he ended his political career in 1976 at age 69. It was good to leave, <PERSON> Pastore </PERSON> said, `` while the music is still playing.'' On the other hand, <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> is the chamber's fourth most senior member. He is the author of the <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> program for college tuition aid. The chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> represents an ambition realized. But <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, a soft-spoken and reserved liberal, has had to face constant, often grating guerrilla warfare from Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, the panel's arch-conservative. He has often had difficulty persuading the panel to face up to its legislative burden, repeatedly failing to obtain the quorums needed to do business. Party officials offer varying assessments of the impact if <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> decides to retire. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mocker </PERSON>, communications director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, asserted that <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> himself is vulnerable to a strong campaign by Rep. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. Speaking for the Democrats, <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>'s retirement `` would move a fairly safe Democratic seat onto the playing field and make it a competitive race.'' But she said that should not develop into an opening wedge that causes Democrats to lose their majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> which the party now controls, 55-45.

 Two 100-ton chunks of the upper <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> were painstakingly cut up and lowered onto a barge 200 feet below to start the job of repairing the critical earthquake-damaged span. For 53 years, the bridge has been the main link between <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude earthquake dislodged a portion of the upper deck and sent it slamming onto the lower portion. The dangerous job of removing the collapsed 200-ton section of the upper bridge started Sunday. To remove the 74-foot by 50-foot section, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> workers sawed the 200-ton slab in half. The first part of the upper bridge was lowered Sunday afternoon, said <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayol </PERSON>. A little before midnight, the second stretch of the upper span was lowered. Work on the lower bridge was scheduled to begin today. During the next month, alternate routes will have to be found for 260,000 vehicles that had been using the Bay Bridge each day. Those include other bridges, a makeshift fleet of ferries and the rapid transit system. `` Everything will take a lot longer than it ordinarily would,'' said a dispatcher for the <ORGANIZATION> Quicksilver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delivery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. The company will use a system of riders on the <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> tunnel under the bay to deliver letters and small packages to runners posted at transit stations in the cities, said the dispatcher, who would not allow his name to be used. `` Ordinarily we would n't use BART at all,'' he said. A huge crane was used to hoist the damaged pieces of the upper deck off the 8.5-mile-long bridge, opened in 1936, <PERSON> Bayol </PERSON> said. Officials say it will cost up to $ 1 million to repair the bridge. Nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge, with the upper deck dangling like an open trap door, provided the first graphic illustration of the magnitude of Tuesday's quake. One woman died when she drove her car into the gap. The bridge had also been in the logo created for the 1989 World Series between the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION>. But its closure contributed to Sunday's decision to delay resumption of the seven-game baseball championship until Friday. Officials hope the added delay will reduce traffic problems. The section of lower roadway that took the brunt of the impact when the upper level fell open must also be removed. But the lower roadway is not repairable, so it will be ripped out in smaller pieces later and a new section installed, <PERSON> Bayol </PERSON> said. State officials hope to reuse the steel portions of the upper span and hoist them back into place, he said. It was cut in half with concrete saws and blow torches to make it easier to move.

 <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas claim to have seized the gem-rich Cambodian border town of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> and routed government troops after months of combat. If true, it would be a major psychological, military and economic victory for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the largest of three guerrilla groups fighting the pro-Hanoi government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. In a radio broadcast, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> military command described the taking of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> on Sunday as `` a victory of strategic and historic meaning.'' During a decade of guerrilla war before <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s professed September withdrawal, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> had been unable to establish a viable `` liberated zone'' inside <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The short, preliminary report said the guerrillas `` utterly routed'' the defending government troops and inflicted severe casualties to provincial and district forces. The report could not be independently verified. It said parts of three Vietnamese divisions, whose soldiers were disguised as Cambodian troops, were also routed and forced to retreat east of Route 10. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> claims <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has left behind tens of thousands of disguised soldiers. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> report said the victors seized 13 artillery pieces, hundreds of anti-aircraft guns, four tanks, eight trucks and tons of ammunition. The report was broadcast just 15 minutes after the alleged capture of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. A transcript was made available by a Western embassy today. <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>, located opposite <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chanthaburi </LOCATION> province, is rich in rubies and sapphires, which have been mined in the area since at least the late 19th century. Some analysts have speculated the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> want <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> not only to boost morale among its fighters but as economic insurance should <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> lessen or cut their support. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> for four years until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s 1978 invasion, sending hundreds of thousands of people to their death as it tried to convert the country into a radical agrarian commune Many Cambodians fear the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> will return to power. Fighting in <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> has been regarded by analysts as a major test of strength between the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and the government. `` I do n't see any possibility it can fall into enemy hands,'' Cambodian Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> told foreign journalists in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> a month ago. At the time, prominent <ORGANIZATION> Phnom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penh </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanharith </PERSON> also said the best troops of each side were contesting the town. The editor said on some days as many as 2,000 mortar shells were falling on <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. By most accounts, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and its coalition partners hope to seize significant territory in western <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and force the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government to the negotiating table. A probable target is the region's largest urban center, <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION>, about 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>. The broadcast by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> command urged fighters to `` fully defend the strategic town of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION>,'' continue attacks and force opponents to the negotiating table. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s two non-communist partners have also scored gains since the Vietnamese troop withdrawal in late September. Western diplomats and resistance leaders say the partners' fortunes have been boosted significantly by sophisticated anti-tank weapons that have arrived in the past few months. The sources say many of the weapons were sent by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which denies shipping any arms to the resistance. Reliable sources also say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pays the cost of some of training in the anti-tank weapons. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> denies providing lethal aid to the resistance. Officials in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said, meanwhile, that Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> will meet four top <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> leaders and perhaps <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance chief Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> in a three-day visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is excepted to be a major topic of discussion, the officials said. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> is to leaves for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> are key backers of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s guerrilla coalition. The Thais allow military supplies, principally from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, to travel through its territory to rebels.

<TEXT>
 It was a battle of world chess champions _ man vs. computer _ and the mind proved mightier than the microchip. For now. The world champion, 26-year-old <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, coasted to two victories Sunday over Deep Thought, a chess-playing computer that can analyze over 700,000 moves a second. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> said at first he missed the psychological tension and energy of a human opponent. But then he `` felt a burst of energy from the audience wanting me to really crush the computer. Because we all have something in common _ we are all human beings.'' The champion said computers are moving in the right direction, and predicted machines will be able to beat strong grandmasters in two or three years. `` I'm very happy I could do in both games what I wanted,'' said <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, who has n't lost a tournament since 1981. `` In the first game, with black, I played quietly. In the second game, I tried to crush it in the opening.'' The winner of the 1989 World Computer Chess Championship retired from the first game after <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>'s 52nd move. Playing white in the second game, <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> took Deep Thought's queen in move 18 The computer hung on for 19 more moves before resigning. The champion noted that the computer kept playing long after a flesh-and-blood opponent would have resigned. `` I think the computer needs to be taught something _ how to resign,'' he said. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> said he accepted the challenge because `` I want to foresee the future.'' The world champion was paid an undisclosed sum for the day's workout, said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Landa </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, the site of the match The computer did n't travel for the match; it remained in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> with a telephone line to relay its moves to a computer terminal in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where someone moved the chess pieces on a board. Deep Thought, created by researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, can search 700,000 positions per second and analyze from five to 20 upcoming moves by each side as well as each move's implications. Last November, <PERSON> Deep </PERSON> <PERSON> Thought </PERSON> beat the world's 96th ranked player, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s Bent <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> _ the first time a computer had defeated a grandmaster in tournament play. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, who lives in the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, became a grandmaster 10 years ago and captured the world championship in 1985. Before the match, chess commentator <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> said: `` Deep Thought is clearly the first chess computer with the potential to draw blood and defeat the world champion.'' <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> predicted the computer would make moves to catch <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> off guard. But it was <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>'s moves that caught the computer by surprise. He said he realized early in the first game that he would win when the computer missed some tactical opportunities and was unable to analyze all of the champion's decisions. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> said if a person had beaten another person as badly, `` He would n't be able to stand the second game.'' In the second game, <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> explained he wanted to create a new opening that the computer would n't be able to break down. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> said that the computer was `` fully aggressive'' but that its `` mind was too straight and too primitive.'' `` Chess is much wider than just calculations. It's even wider than logic. You have to use fantasy, intuition and some kind of prediction,'' <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> said. But the computer does have some advantages, he said. `` We can lose hope. A computer ca n't lose hope.'' `` One of the main goals of the match is to learn something about Deep Thought,'' said <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, who with <PERSON> Feng-hsiung </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> created the computer program at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said it appeared there was a bug in the computer during the match, which was part of an annual chess competition sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> AGS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It was n't looking at the right moves,'' he said. `` It was n't given a chance to show its best style of play.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> leads the nation and much of the world in construction rules for earthquake safety but future quakes will kill many people unless more is done to make buildings and bridges tougher, experts say. Authorities also say that forecast does not apply to shaky <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> alone. Many parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have earthquake potential and could learn lessons from last Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude jolt in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` The lesson of this quake is that we have the technology to radically reduce death, injury and damage in case of an earthquake. Let's get on with using it,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, the only geologist in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Legislature. Unreinforced brick and brittle concrete structures need strengthening, and tax incentives should be given to foster design of new buildings with shock absorbers in foundations, quake-damping devices in walls, and automatic gas-shutoff valves to prevent fires, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. Tuesday's <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area quake claimed scores of lives, many in the collapse of the double-deck <ORGANIZATION> Nimitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeway </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, others in toppled buildings. Yet the overwhelming majority of structures stood. In contrast, the quake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> last Dec. 7, which also measured 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion, killed many of its 25,000 victims in collapsed apartments built with unreinforced masonry walls and precast concrete floor slabs. Armenian cities were also close to the fault, while last week's epicenter was in a rural area 50 miles from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> lacks timber; many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes are built with quake-resistant wood frames. Nevertheless, `` we would have experienced a tremendous amount of devastation without the building codes and standards we have in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' said State Architect <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bocchicchio </PERSON>. `` The number of lives lost and the amount of damage would have approached some quakes in other parts of the world.'' But Tuesday's quake `` was not the ultimate test; we should not rest on our laurels,'' he said, warning of deadly hazard from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s thousands of unreinforced brick buildings and `` soft-story'' concrete buildings with stiff upper levels atop inflexible frames. A 1988 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> study reported that <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> is 60 percent likely to be rocked by a magnitude-7 .5 to 8 `` big one'' within 30 years, while the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area faces 50-50 odds of a magnitude-7 quake, possibly on the <ORGANIZATION> Hayward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fault </ORGANIZATION> beneath <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> said a repeat of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s 8.3-magnitude 1906 quake is only 10 percent likely within 30 years, but a 1980 federal report said it could claim 11,000 lives. The report said the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quake could kill 14,000 people; a magnitude-7 .4 <ORGANIZATION> Hayward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fault </ORGANIZATION> jolt might kill 7,000 `` Unless we take the threat seriously, we could have an appalling death toll,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON>, director of the Oakland-based Bay Area Regional Earthquake Preparedness Project. Past quakes did spur improvements. The 1933 magnitude-6 .3 <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> quake killed 115 people, and many schools collapsed after students went home Laws soon required seismic resistance in new buildings, and old school buildings were strengthened. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Sylmar </LOCATION> quake of 1971, with a magnitude of 6.4, toppled freeway overpasses and killed at least 58 people, many in a collapsed hospital. The temblor prompted stringent hospital construction standards, a 1976 revamp of model building codes, and the $ 58-million first phase of a program to strengthen freeway bridges. A later phase, not yet started, would have attempted to strengthen columns that gave way during the Nimitz collapse. Much damage from Tuesday's quake was n't surprising, including collapse of old unreinforced brick buildings, destruction of homes sitting on soft fill, and fires from natural gas leaks. Seismic disaster threatens much of the nation. Quakes are most frequent in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but great earthquakes rocked <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, in 1811-12, and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> in prehistoric times. The <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> has sustained strong jolts.

 Sue Rakes concedes it may be tough to sit in a boat for an eight-hour bass fishing tournament without a bathroom break, but she does n't think it should keep her out of the competition. `` I take my fishing seriously, and I deserve the same opportunities as the males,'' she said. `` I do n't want to be pushy and feminist, but I want people to understand the situation I'm in. I just want to be treated fairly.'' Organizers for a state tournament sponsored by the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> B.A.S.S. Federation have told her she could n't participate, partly because they say men want their privacy if they need to go to the bathroom Mrs. <PERSON> Rakes </PERSON> has fished her way into the tournament for the past two years. This year, she qualified by finishing 18th out of 122 fishermen who competed in a regional contest. <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON>, the director of the B.A.S.S. Federation in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said the reason women are banned from state and national tournaments was simple. `` Sometimes when you're out on the water, <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Nature </PERSON> calls,'' he said. `` Even though we do n't encourage fishermen to answer the call, sometimes they do.'' Partners are matched randomly for the competition; he said pairing two females in a boat would be a case of discrimination. The state B.A.S.S tournament will be held on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norman </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> in April.

 <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> oysters _ as famous as <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> lobsters until pollution and overfishing wiped them out during World War II _ may be making a comeback. The numbers are tiny as yet, but shellfish dealers report buying occasional batches of oysters from fishermen who normally harvest quahog clams. `` There are quite a bit of oysters around,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, manager of Top Quality Shellfish in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>. `` Two, three years ago, you would n't see anybody digging them.'' But some <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> oyster beds remain off-limits because of pollution. `` The largest oyster population is in the <LOCATION> Pawcatuck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which has been closed -LRB- to shellfishing -RRB- for years,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganz </PERSON>, senior marine biologist with the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. To assess the extent of the comeback, the <ORGANIZATION> Narragansett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> next month will start an 18-month study to pinpoint the bay's oyster beds. `` The speculation now is that they are remnants of the cultivated oyster industry that was flourishing here in 1900 to 1940,'' said <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Karp </PERSON>, the project's director. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, assistant professor of fisheries at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION>, said the drop in metal pollution in the upper bay in the last few years might be one explanation for the oyster revival. Adult oysters can live in extremely polluted waters, but metal contamination can be fatal to oyster larvae. Metal pollution at the <ORGANIZATION> Narragansett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s sewage treatment plant in Providence dropped from 954,000 pounds per year in 1981 to 180,500 pounds per year in 1988, said <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, spokesman for the environmental group Save the Bay. Parts of the bay distant from the plant are open to shellfishing. The oyster industry flourished in <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in the early part of the century. Because oysters spawn best in comparatively fresh water but grow best in saltier water, the baby bivalves were imported into the bay. `` The oysters were dredged from coves in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, schoonered over to <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and left to grow until they were big and fat and succulent,'' <PERSON> Ganz </PERSON> said. `` The old discarded shells would be shoveled back on the schooners, sent back to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and used as cultch,'' the ragged surface that young oysters need to attach themselves to in order to grow. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> oysters in those days were known as the best in the country, smaller but less salty than those raised in the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. `` They had a mystique about them, something like the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> lobsters,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. Increasing pollution and the destruction of reefs by silt and over-use of oyster tongs wiped out the oysters around World War II, and many shellfishermen turned to quahogs, or hard-shell clams, that recently have become a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> state symbol, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. Ironically, a shortage of quahogs may be helping fuel the renewed interest in oystering, said <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>. `` They are digging them now more so because of the shortage of littlenecks,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. `` The upper bay is n't open as much anymore -LRB- to quahogging -RRB- so they're looking for any other way to make a dollar.'' Oysters bring anywhere from 70 cents to $ 1.20 a pound at <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> docks, about the same price as steamer clams but less than the prized littlenecks, the smallest and most tender of the quahogs.

 One month after Hurricane Hugo bashed this shrimping village, 65-foot trawlers remain sprawled along the shattered waterfront, bulldozers remove oaks on roads, and mattresses dry on porches. But as the nation focuses on the earthquake in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area 3,000 miles away, this community of 500 is entering the most difficult part of its recovery. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> hit just as the four-month shrimping season was getting under way. `` Everything is tied to the seafood in one way or another,'' said <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, mayor of the 150-year-old village located about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` I think the biggest problem is the reality of the fact that so much of our economy has been destroyed and that there are so many people that have lost their businesses and their boats.'' <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> roared ashore Sept. 21 with 135 mph winds and storm surges of 10 to 15 feet. The storm ultimately killed 18 and caused at least $ 4 billion in damage in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> alone before fading into the Northeast. `` Shrimping is one of those things where you make it all in about 120, 150 days a year,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said last week. `` If you have n't made it by Thanksgiving, that's it. And that's just about the time most of these guys are going to get back to work.'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s seafood packing plant, which he estimates accounts for about 70 percent of the town's $ 7 million in annual seafood sales, was largely ruined. He hopes to be operating at 50 percent capacity by the time the shrimping season ends in December. About 60 percent of <ORGANIZATION> McClellanville </ORGANIZATION>'s 35-boat fleet was knocked out of service for at least 30 days to 60 days when the hurricane swept ashore, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said. Only 30 feet of the town's 2,500 feet of dock survived the storm. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 50, has been a shrimper for the past 35 years. Now his 73-foot boat, `` Daddy's Girl,'' lies aground some 30 feet from the harbor with an estimated $ 50,000 in damage. `` Shrimping season's over for us,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. He hopes to refloat his boat and obtain a <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> loan, which could supply up to $ 500,000 for lost equipment and wages at interest rates as low as 4 percent. National relief efforts have flooded the village with food, clothing and volunteers, so much so that some has been distributed to other nearby communities. But housing for the newly homeless still remains a problem. Precise figures are unavailable, but officials say nearly 400 people have asked for federal assistance in repairing their homes or relocating to temporary housing. <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> remains closed indefinitely; it was flooded with 7 feet of water. The school's 330 students returned to classes last week, 25 miles away in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> suburbs where teachers are newly trained in stress counseling. For adults, as many as five mental health counselors have been in town every day since the hurricane. Counselors plan to stay into next year. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> is concerned about the time it will take the town to rebound. `` I do n't know how you put a town under,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said. `` It was a real thriving seafood town. -LRB- But -RRB- it's going to take us four or five years to even come close to where we were before.''

 Life for farmworkers was never predictable, even before an earthquake destroyed at least 370 homes and forced hundreds of people onto the streets of this farming community. It's a situation many have faced before _ even in the best of times. `` Being homeless is only a couple of dollars away and they are trying to figure out day-to-day where they are going to live,'' said <PERSON> Estella </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON>, who works for <ORGANIZATION> Salud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Para </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gente </ORGANIZATION>, a community health clinic. `` Life's very unstable and when something like this happens, it adds to it. They live with crises already,'' <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> said. But normally, those crises are personal _ families living 10 to a home or workers combing the region for jobs when the harvests are over. This time, the people are suffering as a community. `` When we go on the streets and into camps to visit, it's a little chaotic. But what gives me hope is there are a lot of people who care,'' <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, a community of 30,000, is near the epicenter of Tuesday's quake, about 80 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. It is a frozen food processing center for vegetables grown in the area's fields City Councilman <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the disaster brought the community together. `` I see neighbors whom I've known for a long time and only say hello to and now suddenly you stop to talk and see what's happened to their houses,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. A half-dozen tent encampments have sprouted in vacant fields where officials estimate 500 are living. About 1,000 others are in three shelters. Countless others are living in cars or yards. Many residents were so frightened by the quake and its aftershocks they refuse to go indoors, even though their homes had been declared safe. `` It's just scary. I think another disaster is going to happen,'' said <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, who has spent nights since the quake with her 8-month-old baby and other family members in the back of her father's truck. `` The little kids are afraid of going into any building.'' <PERSON> Raymundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyva </PERSON> is one of those who fear another tremor could topple the weakened walls of his house. After Tuesday's quake, as soon as he could get to a working telephone line, <PERSON> Leyva </PERSON> called his grandparents in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> who had survived their own powerful earthquake four years ago. `` Everyone was crying. They said they were happy to hear from me because they thought <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> was gone,'' <PERSON> Leyva </PERSON> said. `` They thought it was going to happen, the same thing that happened in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. I did, too.'' City spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> said no attempt will be made to ban camping until all homes are inspected and it is determined who was left truly homeless. Workers so far have marked 330 homes unsafe to enter near the hard-hit downtown area. That total is expected to rise dramatically as workers travel into the outskirts of town, she said. Damage to the city has been estimated at $ 122 million with the loss of downtown businesses making up a quarter of that total. Almost an entire block of businesses bordering a central plaza where townspeople normally gather in the evenings will have to be demolished. Several landmarks, including <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> and the town clock, are among those will have to be razed. `` That's going to dramatically change the appearance of the downtown plaza because those buildings were the backdrop,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. `` There's a lot of Victorian architecture and no one's going to replace it with that style,'' he said. `` Hopefully we wo n't become glass and steel.''

 The earthquake that left them spiritually homeless has n't shaken the faith of the parishioners at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> Francis de Sales Cathedral. The century-old Roman Catholic cathedral was declared unsafe after Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude earthquake _ its tower cracked and leaning. Many parishioners kept away by a wire fence sought spiritual comfort Sunday in a Baptist church down the street. `` Sometimes in life God shakes us and says, ` Pay attention.' There is something more important than the ordinary things in our lives,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> told the congregation. `` It was n't just the ground that shook Tuesday. The earthquake shook a lot of things that we do _ ordinary things on our agenda.'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> has served people in this community for 102 years. It stands in an older section of town across from the bus station. It rarely draws a huge crowd _ senior citizens, neighborhood families and some commuters come together to form what priests call an `` urban community.'' Yet it is loved and its damage has brought pain to the congregation. `` I need to cry. I need to let go. It's a heavy burden on the heart,'' said <PERSON> Ona </PERSON> <PERSON> Solom </PERSON>, who assisted at Sunday's service. But the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON> notes that a church is more than a structure. `` A building is important,'' he said. `` But people, they are more important.'' And while the parishioners at St. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> sang `` From Our Exile God Bring Us Home'' people here and in surrounding communities were joining together to make sure they were all right and to find comfort and to offer help to others. Some churches encouraged congregants to share stories either at prayer breakfasts or services. Churches and synagogues collected money, food and clothes. A group of <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> churches started a counseling service, sending ministers to visit those who need help. At the <ORGANIZATION> Shiloh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION> congregants were urged to donate their skills to help those whose homes had been damaged. `` We do n't want to offer only prayers. We want to offer something more. We want to help people who need it,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiteley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Shiloh </ORGANIZATION>'s minister.

<HEAD>Lawyer Fights for her Right to Carry Semiautomatic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVE EPSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the late 1960s and early 1970s, when many of her fellow college students were demonstrating for peace, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> MacNutt </PERSON> was encouraging women to join her school's shooting team. Later, she opposed a ban on firearms at the University of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. And in one way or another since then, <PERSON> MacNutt </PERSON> has been fighting for the right to bear arms. Her latest battle is against a proposed <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> ban on semiautomatic weapons. For <PERSON> MacNutt </PERSON>, a lawyer, the fight is more than an abstract cause _ she owns and uses semiautomatic rifles, including an M-1A rifle and an SKS carbine. `` I basically use guns for three reasons,'' she says. `` I use them for protection, I use them for target shooting and I also do a little bit of collecting.'' A bill to ban the weapons in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> been approved by the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to take up the legislation Monday. In its present form, the bill would require owners of assault weapons to get special permits from the police commissioner to keep them and would all but ban any new military-style guns in the city. The legislation _ a so-called home rule petition which is proposed by the city but which must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> _ would outlaw specific types of semiautomatic rifles by model. It also would create a board that could add weapons to the banned list. A lifelong gun enthusiast, <PERSON> MacNutt </PERSON> says the measure would unfairly punish those who have legally and responsibly owned guns for years. <PERSON> MacNutt </PERSON> belongs to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and also is on the board of directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Gun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, a statewide group leading the legislative charge against the proposed ban. Her experience with guns dates back to childhood, when an antique gun was part of family folklore. The revolver belonged to her great-grandfather, a ship's captain in the late 1800s. According to family stories, he used the gun to quell a mutiny aboard his leaky ship. Some crew members wanted to abandon the ship for lifeboats, but <PERSON> MacNutt </PERSON>'s grandfather kept them pumping water instead. `` He saved his crew and saved his cargo and it was a good thing he was able to keep control,'' <PERSON> MacNutt </PERSON> said. Her parents encouraged <PERSON> MacNutt </PERSON> and her siblings to ask questions about the gun and handle it under their guidance. `` Firearm safety was impressed upon us at an early age,'' she said. `` There was never any mystique about it. There was never any forbidden fruit.'' <PERSON> MacNutt </PERSON> got her first gun as a Christmas present at age 13. She still has the .22 - caliber bolt action `` I had wanted it and wanted it. When I was 13, they figured I was old enough,'' she says. Today, she owns several semiautomatic weapons, including the M-1A rifle, a version of the M-14 rifle refitted for civilian use, and the SKS <PERSON> Simonov </PERSON> carbine, a semiautomatic weapon with a fixed magazine that holds up to 10 rounds. Those who favor the ban question the value of such weapons for sport shooting. They say the guns only pose a danger to people. <PERSON> MacNutt </PERSON> disagrees. `` They're not the type of gun that I think anybody in their right mind would carry into a holdup because they're large, they're heavy,'' she said <PERSON> MacNutt </PERSON> argues that people who own guns legally do n't misuse them. People who own guns illegally cause the problems, she said, and they are n't going to be stopped by legislation to further regulate gun use. <PERSON> MacNutt </PERSON> lives with her mother in the <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, an area beset by drug-related violence. She has never had to use a gun in self-defense, but says feels safe because she can handle firearms. Fascinated by gun history, <PERSON> MacNutt </PERSON> gives a mini-discourse on the evolution of modern firearms with little prompting. Beginning in her college days, <PERSON> MacNutt </PERSON> has worked hard to integrate women into the sport. She belongs to a number of clubs, and she shoots competitively on weekends during the warm months. There is nothing alarming or exotic about the sport, she said, adding: `` It's much like a bowling club.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> met in emergency session with his top security officials after a weekend attack by U.S.-backed Contra rebels in which 18 soldiers were killed, the government said. The soldiers were ambushed on their way to register for Feb. 25 national elections and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> accused rebels of trying to disrupt voter registration. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> met late Sunday with his brother, Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, and Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> to consider measures against rebel attacks. It was not immediately clear what those might be. The ambush late Saturday occurred near <LOCATION> Cerro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mono </LOCATION>, about 145 miles north of the capital. The soldiers were armed `` but it was a surprise attack, they fell into an ambush'' and could not return fire, said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION> province, where the attack occurred. The attack was part of a Contra campaign to `` disrupt the electoral process,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> alleged. Sunday was the last day for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s 1.3 million people of voting age to register. Officials said government troops on Sunday also fought off rebels in <LOCATION> Chontales </LOCATION> province, 90 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Lt. <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said 15 rebels attacked the voter registration office, but there were no casualties. Two other rebel attacks were reported elsewhere Sunday, but no one was reported killed or injured in those attacks either. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government and the Contra rebels agreed March 21 to suspend offensive operations, but talks aimed at a permanent end to their 7-year-old war are at a stalemate and there has been sporadic fighting. There was no immediate comment from the Contras on Sunday's reports The elections come under a regional peace plan under which five Central American presidents agreed to disband the Contras _ based in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> _ by Dec. 8. In exchange, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> moved up the election date from 1991 and promised free balloting. Last year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off military aid to the Contras, but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> still gives them non-lethal aid. On Saturday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed a $ 9 million aid package designed to support Nicaraguan opposition groups. The 14-party opposition coalition formed for the election has denied any connection to the Contra attacks. Both the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leaders want to maintain the rebels as a fighting force until the election to make sure <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> fulfills his pledge.

<HEAD>Museum Founders Resign After Making False Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The directors of a Vietnam War museum resigned after acknowledging they falsely claimed experience in the war. <PERSON> Gaylord </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, the director and assistant director of the Vietnam War Museum in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>, both had displayed photocopies of military discharge papers that falsely credited them with serving in elite special forces during the war, the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported. Both men resigned after being presented with evidence by the newspaper that their claims of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> military service were fictitious. Rather than being a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1968-69, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> served in the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> from 1969 until 1972 and never left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to information provided by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` This is fact. This is me,'' said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, when handed a copy of his actual service record last week. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, 31, who added seven years to his age to claim having served in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Army Special Forces in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1971-72, conceded last week that he did not even enter the service until 1978, three years after the war ended, the newspaper said. The two said that the end justified the means. `` No matter what you say about us, we did something that no one else has done and no one had the guts to attempt,'' <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said. `` I knew the museum had to be built,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. `` I still believe the only way it could have been built was the way it was built. I assumed a role and I assumed I could take it off just as easily.'' Since its July 4 grand opening, thousands have taken tours conducted by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran volunteers to view the donated war artifacts. `` It's basically a shame that these things occur,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Poncik </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` The museum is a good idea. Too bad it was carried out under less than honorable pretenses.''

<HEAD>Thousands Evacuated In Siberia Pipeline Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of people living near a gas pipeline in western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> were evacuated after an explosion and fire caused by a rupture in the line, which was under repair, Soviet television reported. In a report from <LOCATION> Tobolsk </LOCATION>, 1,000 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the evening news program <ORGANIZATION> Vremya </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday night that the rupture occurred on a section of the same pipeline that exploded June 4, killing 607 people in a nearby train. No injuries or deaths were reported in the blast in a remote, sparsely populated area. The report did not specify how many people were evacuated or when they would be allowed to return. Vremya said the blast ocurred when workers tested the line with water. `` When the pipe burst, not only water, but heavy steam which was still left in the pipe exploded from the rupture,'' the report said. The blast was seen by experts as a warning that other explosions may occur on the pipeline. `` Executive councils of the <LOCATION> Tumen </LOCATION> region were forced to evacuate thousands of people from the danger zone along the pipeline,'' the report said. According to Vremya, it will be unsafe to fully resume pumping gas through the pipeline for at least two years. `` We believe that two years at least are needed to bring the pipeline into an operational state,'' chief engineer V.N. <PERSON> Chepursky </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Vremya </ORGANIZATION>. If the pipeline is reopened too quickly, he said, `` the lives of thousands of people who live alongside the pipeline will be threatened.'' The report said `` The more thoroughly repair teams work, the more faulty places on the pipeline they discover.'' The June explosion severely crimped the country's gas supply, officials said in July. Gas Minister <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernomyrdin </PERSON> said at the time that the pipeline normally carried 13,500 of the 17,000 tons of liquefied gas sent daily to the country's center from western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. After the explosion, the daily supply was cut by 5,000 tons. The 1,155-mile pipeline, carrying a mixture of benzene, propane and butane from western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> to the center of the country, burst June 4 as two passenger trains were passing in a nearby valley. An electric spark from one of the trains touched off an explosion and fire, killing 607 passengers near <LOCATION> Ufa </LOCATION>, 745 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Commonwealth leaders today accused <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of disloyalty for repudiating the group's new strategy to pressure <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on reforms. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ignored `` fair play'' by issuing a separate dissenting statement without telling the others just an hour after the summit released its <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> declaration Sunday. The dispute flared when the 49-nation summit of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and its former colonies resumed in closed session on its penultimate date. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had signed the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> declaration, which incorporated Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s objections to key provisions. Those included giving the white-led government six months to fulfill promises of dismantling apartheid and calling for tighter financial pressure on <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. In her dissenting statement, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> endorsed the declaration's stipulation that current embargoes should be maintained but charged that they have strengthened white extremism in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Today with the leaders sitting round the conference table, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, the main authors of the declaration, criticized Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` The price of <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> membership is loyalty,'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s aides quoted him as saying British officials reported Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> replied she was `` astounded and utterly appalled'' at the attacks. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> told reporters after the heated session, `` I believe if you are going to function in a Commonwealth you have to follow the basic British tradition of fair play.'' `` Where would we be if 49 countries did this?'' he said. `` You sign a deal at five o'clock and repudiate it at six ... -LRB- saying -RRB- by the way, what I signed really does n't reflect all my views.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, `` This is not the way business should be done,'' Australian officials reported. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said they had wide backing from the other leaders in the mainly Third World organization, which includes black African countries that are deeply hostile to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government and apartheid The contretemp was the latest over <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which quit the Commonwealth in 1961. For most of the 1980s the sanctions issue has split the organization, which prides itself on being a unique `` family'' with a shared language and history. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is the Commonwealth's sole opponent of imposing tough embargoes. She has argued forcibly at <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s new president, F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, deserves encouragement in moves toward reform, not more sanctions. In <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said, `` Sanctions can only further delay the negotiation process in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' `` Any efforts to prescribe a time schedule or an agenda is rejected by the South African government,'' he added. The declaration says the sanctions aim to bring the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> government to the negotiating table. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, leaving the conference hall, said she was entitled to spell out her `` different view.'' `` You've got to be fair. You've got to be fair,'' she said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> tried to smooth things over. Prime Minister <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s `` way of doing things ... is n't calculated to make the heads of government happy.'' `` But I do n't think it is good for the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> to turn it into an organization that orchestrates hymns of hate against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>,'' he said. British Foreign Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON> claimed late Sunday that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has `` dragged'' the largely Third World organization into softening its position on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> denied this, saying <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will face new reprisals unless it has set about the `` irreversible'' abolition of apartheid by April. In the delaration, the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> said it would call for greater financial pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. That includes asking international banks to restrict South African trade credits to a maximum of 90 days and make it more difficult for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to secure loans. The body also decided to appoint a new body to scrutinize <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s trade links. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> objected to these provisions. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has refused to implement most of a list of 11 non-mandatory <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> embargoes adopted in 1986. Black southern African <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> members also continue to trade because of their economic dependence on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train hit a freight train at a crossing, injuring four people and derailing two locomotives and two cars. One freight car knocked a shack into a swimming pool. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s Broadway Limited, heading west with 230 passengers from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, hit the southbound 116-car <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> train at 5:43 a.m. Sunday, <LOCATION> Wyandot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hetzel </PERSON> said. The freight train was carrying `` everything from sand to syrup,'' including carbolic acid in one car, but none of the cargo spilled, said <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Just </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. One freight car tumbled from the track, into two outbuildings, pushing one of them into a swimming pool at a nearby residence in this north-central <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> city, Ms. <PERSON> Just </PERSON> said. The owner of the house, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Swinehart </PERSON>, said he found the car in his yard when he arrived home. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackling </PERSON>, who was asleep in the house at the time, was unharmed and said he was not awakened. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s crew submitted to alcohol and drug tests, which are required after such accidents, said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. She said the specimens were sent to a laboratory in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and she did not know when the tests would be finished. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> inspectors arrived Sunday to determine why the collision occurred, but said no ruling on the accident was expected until Tuesday. `` My understanding is the <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> was moving very slowly,'' Ms. <PERSON> Just </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> train was traveling at about 35 miles an hour, she said. The tracks had been cleared by Sunday night and both trains had resumed their journeys, according to the sheriff's office. Buses were brought in from <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> to carry train passengers to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hetzel </PERSON> said. Train fireman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schleppi </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, underwent surgery for internal injuries and was listed in fair condition, according to a spokeswoman at Wyandot Memorial Hospital. Conductor <PERSON> Forace </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, 63, of <LOCATION> Bluffton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, was in fair condition with a suspected heart attack, she said. An <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> engineer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Whippen </PERSON>, 59, of <LOCATION> Elkhart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, was treated for a broken foot and released, while passenger <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, 76, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was treated for chest pains and released, officials said.

 From cash to croutons, tax tips to televisions, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area residents and businesses are pitching in to feed and comfort their earthquake-shattered neighbors.

<HEAD>China Agrees To Resume Repatriation Of Illegal Immigrants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said today <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will again take back illegal immigrants caught crossing into <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in a sign of easing tension between <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and the British colony. Chinese authorities have refused to repatriate citizens who sneaked into the British colony illegally since early this month, when <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> allowed a dissident Chinese swimmer flee to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The terse statement said an agreement was reached after discussions between the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government and the local branch of <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the de facto <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in the territory. About 1,100 Chinese were awaiting repatriation today. A government spokeswoman said she did not know how many would be returned Tuesday. `` It's quite good as far as we're concerned in that we're back to normality with the Chinese,'' a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> official said on condition of anonymity. He said he expected the agreement would reduce tension `` quite a bit.'' Relations between <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, which reverts to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997, have been delicate in recent months. Many of the colony's 5.7 million people supported the spring pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> warned the colony not to become a base for efforts to topple the communist government. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was angered when <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> let the dissident swimmer, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after he overstayed his visa, instead of repatriating him. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> had participated in the pro-democracy movement. The local <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> office said the colonial government set a bad precedent in handling the case. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> then decided to stop accepting the return of illegal immigrants and said cooperation would not resume until the British and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> governments showed their sincerity. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> did not elaborate. The government statement issued today said both sides reaffirmed understandings on the return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of illegal immigrants and Chinese who overstay their visas in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government has sent back all illegal immigrants from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since 1980. More than 12,000 have been sent back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> this year.

<HEAD>Sex Game Could Hinder Emergency Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Workers have programmed an X-rated game into the computer system used by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s ambulance corps, and an expert fears it could drag out emergency response times, according to a report published today. Ambulance dispatchers and other <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> workers could be distracted by the sex game, or the program could spread a virus into the computer system and cause it to break down, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. The newspaper quoted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrofsky </PERSON>, a senior management consultant for the ambulance system, who said he was fired last week after he notified his superiors about the threat posed by the game, `` Foreplay.'' `` It's a disaster waiting to happen,'' <PERSON> Petrofsky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Petrofsky </PERSON> said he warned top <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials for eight months while he was demoted and then fired. Officials will search the system today for the sex game, `` to see whether we can get a hold of this program,'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> EMS </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday. The time it takes to dispatch an ambulance to a medical emergency would double from three to six minutes if dispatchers had to work manually during a computer crash, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehl </PERSON>, a former medical director of EMS. `` It's very possible calls will get lost,'' <PERSON> Kuehl </PERSON> added.

 The death toll from Typhoon <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> rose to 30 today from new reports of damage wrought by the strongest storm to hit the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> this year, officials said. The typhoon, which packed winds of 127 mph, also left more than 332,000 people homeless and injured 95 others when it hit the northern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> on Thursday, the military's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Search Ends With No Flange, Investigators Wait on Harvest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Searchers ended their quest Sunday for engine pieces from a jetliner that crashed in July, with no luck in finding a part important to investigators. Search teams from metal detector clubs turned up some engine fragments over the weekend when they ranged over corn and soybean stubble, but a flange remained missing. Investigators hope farmers completing their harvest may come across the flange, which connected the forward fan shaft to the disc in the tail-mounted DC-10 engine made by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engines </ORGANIZATION>. The flange was held together with 20 bolts. Of the parts still missing, the flange is the most important to investigators, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, flight safety investigator for <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>, which called off the search after two straight weekends of hunting. `` There's one square mile yet to be harvested along the primary path of fragments we've found,'' he said Sunday. The location of parts in fields helps investigators determine what pieces came in contact with others, he said. The No. 2 engine flew apart as <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 was flying north of <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION>, spewing metal and severing hydraulic lines for flight controls. Pilots wrestled the jumbo jet to the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> but the plane cartwheeled down a runway in a fiery crash that killed 112 of the 296 aboard. Volunteers on Sunday found a fragment of a fan blade from the No. 2 engine and a piece of a track for engine ball bearings, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. On Saturday, searchers north of <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION> found two blade retainers that were part of the engine rotors, and a part of the hydraulic pump. Along with airplane debris, searchers found artifacts from more than a century of farming and rural living, including a sledge hammer and old horseshoes with spikes, which provided animals with traction while pulling old-time farm implements. The search by about 90 volunteers centered Sunday on the <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> farm. `` I told them that the area they were searching used to have a farmstead on it, so I'm sure they'll find all sorts of things,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. Another resident, <PERSON> Konny </PERSON> <PERSON> Droegmiller </PERSON>, will keep an old brass sleigh bell that was found. `` I'll make it into something to hang on the front door for Christmas,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, which called off its search Sunday, offered more than $ 270,000 in rewards for engine parts. Farmer <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> received $ 119,000 earlier this month when she found most of the rear engine fan disc as she worked in a field. The rest of the disc was found on the nearby farm of <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Halverson </PERSON>, who received about $ 40,000 in reward money. This weekend, a $ 1,000 reward was paid for a set of shrouds for a fan blade. The shrouds help dampen vibration and also serve as spacers between fan blades.

 The largest union of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Post-Dispatch </LOCATION> has rejected a proposal for a five-year contract and authorized a strike if a new agreement ca n't be reached when formal negotiations begin early next year. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 47 </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday rejected the company's early offer by a vote of 220 to 186, a spokeswoman said. The union then voted 286 to 29 to authorize a walkout if a contract ca n't be reached when regular negotiations begin sometime after Jan. 1. Of the 11 unions at the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, five have extended their contracts; three, including the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, have rejected early offers. Three other unions declined to participate in early contract talks and will enter negotiations later. The Guild represents 660 employees. Major provisions of the contract offer were wage increases of 4 percent a year, the introduction of a drug-testing policy and the elimination of a `` sympathy strike'' clause. Guild officials said one of the most objectionable points of the offer was the establishment of a `` two-tier'' wage system, under which some new employees would be paid at a lower scale. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penniman </PERSON> IV, publisher of the <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON>, said he was disappointed with the vote and surprised that union members authorized a strike vote when the current contract did not expire until Feb. 28.

<HEAD>Report: Secret Subway in Beijing Would Enable Leaders to Escape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders have built a secret subway line under the streets of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> so they can escape in the event of a counterrevoltution, according to a British TV documentary. The railway network runs between the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION> overlooking <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and the Xi Shan mountain military base in <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a former Chinese civil servant told <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World In Action.'' The program was scheduled to be broadcast today. The unidentified man, who said he fled to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> after the June military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, said he twice rode the underground trains to the military base. `` They can have a headquarters there if they wish,'' he said. `` They have hospitals and also army camps and ammunition dumps there. They have all these facilities open to their use.'' The former official said two other stations are linked to the line _ one under the government compound at <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION> where party leaders live and work, and the other under the Bank of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> where the country's gold is stored. The identities of those interviewed in `` The Terror After Tiananmen'' were concealed to protect them from arrest. The producers were not credited to prevent Chinese authorities from tracing their sources, the program said. The civil servant worked at a junior level but was well-connected. He worked in an office in which he could observe senior leaders first hand, according to the program. The documentary was made secretly in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> with amateur video cameras after the June crackdown, producers said. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of protesters were killed as troops rolled through <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> streets to recapture Tiananmen from the students.

<TEXT>
 Christian leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> put his forces on alert today after rejecting <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s peace plan as a `` road to hell'' because it lacks a specific timetable for a Syrian troop withdrawal. In a speech before 5,000 cheering supporters and broadcast live on his government-controlled radio station, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> indicated he might dissolve the lawmaking body. The accord, approved Sunday by a special parliamentary session held in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, suffered another jolt when the two main militias of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million-strong Shiite Moslem sect also rejected the Arab-brokered plan. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> told a late-night news conference Sunday that he accepts more power-sharing with Moslems, for which the accord provides. But `` what the deputies approved in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> is a crime I will not accept,'' he said. `` I have demanded a Syrian withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but they came up with a peace plan full of ambiguities about this issue which constitutes <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sovereignty,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> added. The 54-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly demanded withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and in March sparked the latest outbreak in the country's 14-year-old civil war by blockading illegal militia-run ports. Moslem militias allied with the Syrians responded by shelling the Christian enclave. More than 900 people were killed and at least 2,000 wounded in savage shelling duels until an Arab League-sponsored cease-fire took hold Sept. 22. Throughout the shelling, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> portrayed his military campaign as a crusade to rid <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> of Syrian troops, who arrived in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate but later sided with the Moslems. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said a referendum should be held on the accord and offered to step down if they support it. `` If they support me I shall lead them to achieve <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sovereignty Otherwise I will relinquish authority because I can not commit the crime of approving such a plan,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> told the news conference. `` This accord is the road to hell.'' The civil war has prevented parliamentary elections, which were last held in 1972, and it was unclear how a referendum could be held. In his radio address today, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> told the crowd outside his shell-pocked presidential palace that members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> `` must understand that their role is over and that now it is your turn, yours alone. `` You have to come forth to assume the mantle,'' he said. `` What happened in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> is a mistake that should be corrected.'' That was seen as an indication that <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, might dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to scuttle the peace plan. The demonstrators, mostly students, responded to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s speech, chanting `` With blood, with our souls, we defend you, general.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> had ordered schools and universities in the Christian enclave to close for the day. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s response, compounded by the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> rejection, put the future of the plan in doubt and raised fears that shelling battles would resume. A senior official at <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command center, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said today that all leave was canceled for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 mainly Christian troops and they were ordered to stay in their barracks. He called it `` a defensive measure.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> discussed the Taif accord with intellectuals, industrialists, bankers and militia leaders in the Christian enclave. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s lawmakers have been meeting in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> since Sept. 30 under <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> auspices and removed from the strife of their homeland. On Sunday, 59 of the 62 deputies present voted for the draft plan but made their action contingent on approval by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and his rival, acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. Two deputies abstained, one voted ` no' and another was absent because of illness. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> vying for power with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian government, welcomed the Taif accord in a statement issued today and called for its adoption without any reservations. `` The only alternative we envisage to the accord is suicide,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said. `` No one has the right to take a decision to commit suicide on behalf of the people and the nation.'' Today, the deputies prepared to pack and travel to the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION> for a closing parliament session Tuesday to be attended by King Fahd. Conference sources said it would be largely ceremonial. The pro-Syrian mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia and the pro-Iranian fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, rejected the accord because they want a bigger representation corresponding to their status as <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest single sect. Under the peace plan, the number of seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would be raised from the current 99 to 108, equally divided between Moslems and Christians. In the Taif talks, Moslems had called for raising the number to 128, but that was later lowered in a compromise. Amal leaders are demanding that the number be raised even higher than 128 to give `` a wider representation to all militias and institutions.'' In a separate statement, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said, `` any solution from <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> does not concern us ... the only system that safeguards justice and equality is Islam.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> advocates the creation of an Islamic republic in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> patterned on the fundamentalist revolutionary regime in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia fought alongside the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION>, said he would accept the accord `` upon <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s request,'' but added he was not happy about it. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of various right-wing Christian factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, supported the Taif accord.

<TEXT>
 It's being called the `` year of 100 murders.'' A once-quiet city has erupted with drive-by shootings, drug-running and nightly gunfire. `` We started on New Year's morning with two drug-related homicides and it has n't stopped since,'' says police Capt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hegerty </PERSON>. The city broke its previous record of 95 homicides in a year, set in 1987, early in October. Police logged the 100th homicide early last week, and the toll went to 101 on Sunday night when a 24-year-old man was shot to death in his car on a North Side street. Even the onset of colder weather has n't slowed the carnage the way it usually does. `` There's only been two weeks this year when we did n't have a homicide reported,'' <PERSON> Hegerty </PERSON> said. `` I was hoping the numbers would drop off, but they keep going up.'' <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> residents, who treasure their ethnic neighborhoods, clean streets and tradition of progressive government, are mobilizing to turn back the tide of violence. Many neighborhoods are forming block watch groups, and in other cases, residents are simply taking it on themselves to call the police when they see drug deals or other illegal activity, said <PERSON> Alderwoman </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who represents an inner-city ward. `` There have been a lot of busts lately, and many of those have been due to citzen alerts,'' she said. `` The key is the people in the community saying, ` Hey, this is enough of this.''' The number of murders has been climbing since 1985, except for a drop last year. There were 73 murders in 1985, 85 in 1986, 95 in 1987 and 73 in 1988. That is despite a decline in city population that started at least two decades ago. The latest population estimate of about 600,000 in January 1988 was down by about 36,000 from the 1980 census total. As is the case in other cities, drugs get much of the blame for the increase in killings. At least 12 of this year's homicides have been directly linked to drug activity and many of the remainder are believed to have involved alcohol or drug intoxication, <PERSON> Hegerty </PERSON> said. The violence has included so-called `` drive-by'' shootings where someone fires from a car and then speeds away. Police blame gang activity for three drive-by shootings last summer, including one that killed a 30-year-old man standing outside a tavern less than a block from his house. `` Our problem is serious,'' <PERSON> Hegerty </PERSON> said, `` but fortunately, as bad as it is, I do n't think it's as bad as it is in other major cities.'' <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> native and president of a block watch group in her neighborhood on the city's near north side, bemoans the change rising crime has brought to her community. Fear, she noted, is changing the traditional Halloween. `` When we were kids, we went out when it was dark and our parents let us have the run of the neighborhood,'' she said. `` We would never let that happen today. We ought to be alarmed by that.'' The roots of the problem go deeper than the current drug problem, to poverty and racial discrimination that keeps minorities unemployed, say Ms. <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> and others. `` Give people a better environment to live in and give them something constructive to do. Then you'll see a turnaround,'' says the Rev. LeHavre Buck, director of Harambee, an organization working to improve conditions for inner-city residents. `` Now, as usual, we're in a position of reacting,'' he said. `` We're trying to shut the gate after the horse has gone.''

She says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, at one time White House chief of staff and now secretary of state, `` did a fine job'' at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> but `` also cultivated the press assiduously - perhaps too much, because he leaked constantly. `` Although <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> did a lot for <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, I always felt that his main interest was <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>,'' she says. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, a White House aide before he became attorney general, was `` a jump-off-the-cliff-with-the-flag-flying conservative,'' she said, and one of those who `` are so rigid in their beliefs that they'd rather lose than win a partial victory.'' She says <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s personal financial problems `` made me squirm'' and he should have resigned earlier as attorney general after an investigation of them began. She accuses <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> of taking her interest in astrology and `` twisting it to seek his revenge on <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> and me'' in the book of memoirs that <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote after being fired as chief of staff in the aftermath of the Iran-Contra affair. `` She does n't seem to realize what's been going on during those eight years,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. `` She has no gratitude to anyone. In yesterday's <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, they had a full spread on this book and in it they showed 20 people, all of whom <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> criticizes.'' Of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s charge that he betrayed her confidential relationship with astrologer <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said, `` Of course only the two of them were privy to that conversation. But nevertheless, Mrs. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> is the one that determined when the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would leave to go on a trip, when were the best days for a press conference, what were the best days for him to do certain speeches. That, in a way, is a controlling of the schedule and when one controls the schedule of the most powerful man on earth one has an awful lot of power.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s book makes light of her influence at times but leaves no doubt that she expressed herself strongly on many personnel and other decisions of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration. `` Had it been up to me,'' she writes, `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> might well have been a one-term president.'' The book, coauthored with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>, is scheduled for publication Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says that in 1983, missing her friends and her home in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and concerned for her husband's safety after one attempt on his life, she tried to persuade him not to run again. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was determined to seek re-election so that he could work for his policies for another four years and because he believed it had been too long since a president had served a full two terms, she says. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also dicusses her marriage to the future president on March 4, 1952, saying they experienced a difficult first year. `` During that year we had our first child, <PERSON> Patti </PERSON>, who was born _ go ahead and count _ a bit precipitously but very joyfully, on October 22, 1952.'' In an interview published in the Sunday editions of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Patti </PERSON>'s conception: `` Uh, if you're asking if I ever lived with <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, ` No, I did not.' Um, but you're also talking about a man in his 40s and a woman _ what? _ in her late 20s. We're not talking about teen-agers. And we knew we were going to get married.'' The former first lady says her husband was never a `` warmonger,'' but `` his calling the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an evil empire was not particularly helpful in establishing a dialogue with the other side.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says she believes acceptance of her advice might have saved the president trouble in several instances. She says <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not ask her opinion of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, the White House budget director who expressed his misgivings about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration economic plan in a 1981 magazine article. But she says she gave it to him anyway. `` Had it been up to me, <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> would have been out on the street that afternoon,'' she writes. She says she and the president also disagreed about Secretary of Labor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, who resigned after being indicted on fraud and larceny charges of which he was later acquitted. He had done nothing wrong, she says, `` but as I told <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> on any number of occasions, it would have been better for everyone if he'd stepped down earlier.''

 A <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police officer went on trial today for the shooting of a black motorcyclist whose death touched off three days of racial violence in January. The trial of Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> opened amid tight security and pleas for calm. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> is charged with two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of the motorcyclist, <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, and his passenger, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was shot to death during a police chase, and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> died when the machine wrecked. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> has said he fired in self-defense because the speeding motorcycle headed straight for him. But other witnesses in the <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> neighborhood dispute that version, calling the shooting unwarranted. Defense attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> opened the trial by saying it will be impossible to seat an objective jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He asked that the trial be moved to another city. `` We are going to show that what jurors who sit on this case will have on their minds is that if Officer <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> is acquitted, there is going to be a riot,'' he said. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiffrin </PERSON> said the government was convinced that an objective jury can be seated, and he opposed defense efforts to introduce television tape, newspaper articles and witnesses to tell the story of the January riot. `` To replay everything that has transpired since January would be unnecessary, and in addition tends to inflame the community,'' the prosecutor said. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> said he would consider starting jury selection immediately, and then sequestering the panel during subsequent pre-trial motions so they will not be affected by publicity before testimony starts. Outside the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s friends and family members waved <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> flags and placards of support as they marched up and down a sidewalk. A smaller group denounced the Colombian-born officer. One man, who loudly proclaimed <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> `` a cold-blooded murderer,'' was taken into custody when he tried to enter the courtroom. Police killings of blacks _ or the subsequent trials _ have triggered violence in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> four times in the 1980s, and crisis teams were in place today around the racially tense city. The fear of renewed violence was a key to the defense's effort to move the trial from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The Jan. 16 slaying touched off burning and looting in predominantly black neighborhoods. One person was killed, 11 were wounded by gunfire and 13 structures burned down only days before the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area was host to the Super Bowl. Tensions, especially between blacks and Hispanics, remained high after the violence. At one point, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> wrote a letter to Police Chief <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> asking that its members be pulled from black neighborhoods because of residents' anger. The chief, who is black, denied the request. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s family has filed a $ 10 million federal lawsuit against the city, accusing the police department of displaying a pattern of violence, especially toward blacks. Many Hispanics have taken up <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s cause, collecting money for him during radio pledge drives. The <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police force, which patrols part of the largely black <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area hit by riots in January, has given its officers riot classes and new gas masks, and has two armored trucks on standby. Even while urging calm, black leaders including <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> acknowledge that blacks are intently watching the trial. The board has been training teams that will head into any neighborhood where violence begins. `` I wo n't sit here and tell you that nothing, absolutely zero, will happen,'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said. `` But we are optimistic that whatever does occur, we will be able to reduce the level drastically.'' The board has proposed an interracial pop concert on Nov. 10 and a `` unity summit'' to help keep the peace.

 Several hundred East German workers at an electronics plant outside <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> have formed the communist nation's first independent labor union, a spokesman said today. <PERSON> Roelf </PERSON> <PERSON> Boerger </PERSON> said the union's platform includes a demand for the right to strike, and he urged all 6,000 employees of the <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Pieck </PERSON> factory in <LOCATION> Teltow </LOCATION> to join the new labor movement. He said the union's name is `` Reform.'' <PERSON> Boerger </PERSON>'s statement was distributed to Western news media in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Despite a more candid approach to news reporting in recent days, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency made no immediate mention of the electronics workers' declaration. <PERSON> Boerger </PERSON> said the union declares solidarity with new opposition political groups in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and calls for a thorough restructuring of the communist state's economy. The new leadership's attitude toward the Reform trade group was not immediately made clear. The factory where it was founded is named after <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s first president. On Sunday, the head of the state-controlled trade federation called for more independence for labor organizations. Since <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> took over the nation's leadership from <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on Wednesday, the official news media have been filled with unusually frank articles about the nation's troubles. But neither <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> nor other senior Communists have indicated any willingness to share power with opposition groups or allow an independent trade movement like <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity to take root. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> today devoted four pages to reform discussions that it said were `` going on all across the nation.'' The newspaper also gave prominent play to a lively, public exchange between top communist officials in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and pro-democracy activists on a downtown <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> street on Saturday. <PERSON> Neues </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschland </PERSON> devoted nearly a full page to discussions held in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> on Sunday concerning <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economic and social problems. For the first time, the newspaper quoted a member of the outlawed Neues Forum -LRB- New Forum -RRB- opposition group as saying the group does not consider itself a real opposition party, `` because we want to improve socialism.'' `` But democratic reforms are necessary,'' the newspaper quoted Neues Forum member <PERSON> Petra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lux </PERSON> as saying. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which like others in the country is allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has urged the government to recognize Neues Forum, which was banned as `` anti-social'' by authorities last month.

 A federal prosecutor today outlined evidence against five Americans charged with conspiring with Colombian drug lord <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> to smuggle and distribute cocaine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In closing arguments in what has been dubbed the `` Son of Lehder'' trial, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> told jurors that the conspiracy began in 1974 and continued until early this year. Following arguments from the five defense attorneys, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> will give instructions to the 12 jurors so they can begin their deliberations. The government contends the five defendants were involved in a conspiracy with <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> that began in 1974 and continued through February of this year. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 40, was convicted last year and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for running a massive smuggling operation. He was convicted following a 7 -LCB- - month trial The latest case grew out of an investigation that followed <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s trial. Defense attorneys say their clients either were n't part of the Lehder conspiracy or withdrew from it so long ago that they should come under the statute of limitations. On trial are <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 59, who was convicted last year on drug conspiracy charges and sentenced to 15 years in prison; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Herington </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Hyannis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lady </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; and air charter service owner <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Prosecutors claim <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, who is charged with operating a continuing criminal enterprise and conspiracy to distribute, often acted as an intermediary between <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> and his corps of Americans pilots and distributors. <LOCATION> Herington </LOCATION> faces one count of conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, Lady, and <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> face the conspiracy distribution count and an addition charge of conspiracy to import cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Morning traffic was heavy and stormy weather played havoc with the elaborate transit plans of 3 million commuters, many of whom abandoned their cars to board buses, trains or ferries on the first major workday since an earthquake ravaged the city. Normally crowded freeways and the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, which links <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, remain closed because of damage. Commutes that usually take 45 minutes were forecast at two hours. <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Gappa </PERSON> reported fewer accidents than normal, and no major problems. `` The volume of traffic is worse than normal,'' <PERSON> Gappa </PERSON> said. `` If we did n't have rain we probably would n't have as many problems as we do. There are more problems with flooding and trees down than traffic accidents.'' Traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge was bumper-to-bumper but moving shortly after 5 a.m. PDT, and many people appeared to be carpooling. Highway 101 was a sea of lights, some parking lots at subway stations were full, and one ferry that normally sails with 140 people carried 572 on an early trip. <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> warnings were posted early today, rain was heavy in some areas and one ferry was turned back because of rough waters on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, authorities said. On the 6 a.m. ferry from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a 30-minute crossing took 55 minutes through heavy seas, with swells occasionally washing over the top of the boat. `` I've just been through hell, but heck, I have to admit I made it through it,'' said passenger <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Trowbridge </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, who normally would drive across the Bay Bridge. `` It can only get better, this ca n't get much wors.'' `` Everybody's just going to have to go into slow-motion. That includes all the bosses,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. The effort to avoid `` gridlock'' reached a feverish pitch Sunday, when <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Diridon </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, declared riding alone in a vehicle an `` anti-social act.'' `` We've got to convince people that it's not business as usual and that it wo n't be business as usual in some places for years,'' <PERSON> Diridon </PERSON> said. A fleet of ferries was called into service to make more than 225 trips shuttling an estimated 10,000 stranded residents from the east side of the bay to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. But at best, conceded <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Markowitz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MTC </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of transit coordination, post-quake planning `` might avoid a total disaster'' on the roads. `` We're optimistic, but I think that realistically, a lot of people are still going to try to squeeze on the roads,'' he said. Experts predicted that two-thirds of commuters in the <LOCATION> nine-county </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area would experience delays as they tried to get to and from work. The collapse of a portion of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, which typically carries 65,000 people during rush hour every weekday, created the biggest headache, and snarls were expected on other major arteries as commuters tried alternate routes. In <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, the ruin of Interstate 880 cut off a major thoroughfare that used to carry 170,000 vehicles daily. Repairs are expected to take years. The Embarcadero Freeway along the waterfront in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which connects downtown with the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> district and Fisherman's <ORGANIZATION> Wharf </ORGANIZATION>, has been deemed unusable until at least mid-1990. A five-mile stretch of Interstate 280 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was closed from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 101 to Sixth Street. In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, State Highway 17 was closed to through traffic because of landslides and mudslides. That four-lane road provides a critical link for 20,000 people who commute daily to work in <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. It will be closed indefinitely, although one lane is open to buses and emergency vehicles. The <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> district, which runs trains through a tube under the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, beefed up service and planned to start running trains around the clock beginning at midnight. <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> telephone information lines were jammed Sunday, with delays of several minutes common once callers got through the busy signals. Callers to a carpool service that matched riders with drivers also had to be patient as workers fielded a steady stream of calls. `` There's two of us here and it's kept us busy,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Solano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rideshare </LOCATION>, a state-funded carpool operation. <ORGANIZATION> MTC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Markowitz </PERSON> said many large corporations had expressed interest in offering flex-time schedules to help dilute the commute, but no one dared predict how many workers would work off-hours. <PERSON> Markowitz </PERSON>, who expressed hope the crisis would force long-term changes in the way people get around in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, had only one wish. `` I think we're going to see a lot of people who have n't tried transit try it,'' he said. `` I just hope they'll be tolerant, patient and have a good sense of humor.''

 More than 150 cars slammed into each other today in chain-reaction pileups on fog-shrouded southern highways, seriously injuring six people, police in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> state reported. Police said excessive speed was the major cause of the accidents that occurred in heavy fog with visibility at less than 50 yards. One hundred vehicles were involved in the first collisions on the A-93 Autobahn between <PERSON> Weiden </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Regensburg </LOCATION>, about 95 miles north of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, police said. In a second chain-reaction crash, 55 vehicles piled up on the A-3, another superhighway between <LOCATION> Regensburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Passau </LOCATION> near the border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, police said in a statement released to the news media. West German autobahns, many of which have long stretches with no speed limits, are often the scene of crashes in the foggy autumn months.

 Caustic fumes released by a spill of hydrochloric acid forced the evacuation of more than 2,000 residents, and 39 people were treated for eye and throat irritation.

 About 600 firefighters got help from rain to substantially encircle a blaze that has charred nearly 11,000 acres of wilderness since last week. The fire was declared 80 percent contained Sunday, with full containment expected by tonight. The blaze began Wednesday during a military training exercise on firing ranges at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' Camp <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON>, spreading to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> wilderness area in <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. An investigation to find a cause continued. Firefighters said they saw little of the fire smoldering. `` But the problem is until you get a couple days' sun on it you're not sure where it's still hot,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundick </PERSON> of the U. S <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` All it takes is one root or one stump still smoldering that we do n't notice, and the winds come up, and it's off and running again. Although there was activity on the northeastern flank of the fire, the blaze did not spread Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said. Firefighters using infrared detectors will examine the entire fire line before the blaze is declared out, <PERSON> Bundick </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The extreme rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> made strong showings in city elections in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s richest state, sparking demonstrations in at least two cities, officials said today The Republicans, running candidates for the first time in many cities of <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemburg </LOCATION>, often garnered more than 10 percent of the vote in Sunday's balloting, according to preliminary figures. The results are expected to put further pressure on Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CDU </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, which lost more than 5 percent of the vote in the largest cities. `` The Republicans wo n't improve anything. They will just make politics more difficult,'' said <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> CDU </ORGANIZATION> mayor, <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rommel </PERSON>, after the Republicans picked up its first five of the 60 city council seats, or 9.6 percent of the vote. The <ORGANIZATION> CDU </ORGANIZATION> lost four of its 24 seats in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, the state capital, falling from 38.8 percent to 33.1 percent of the vote. More than 200 young protesters gathered in front of <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>'s city hall Sunday night to demonstrate against the wins by the Republicans, who are led by <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON>, a former Nazi Waffen SS soldier About 150 young leftist protesters stormed city hall in <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION>, where the Republicans won 6.9 percent of the vote to gain about four out of the 60 city council seats. No arrests or injuries were immediately reported. The Republicans garnered more than 10 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> Pforzheim </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Heilbronn </PERSON>, and 14.2 percent in <LOCATION> Heidenheim </LOCATION>, all cities of about 100,000 people. The party even picked up cities in the traditional leftist stronghold of <LOCATION> Freiburg </LOCATION>. Officials said final results were expected later in the week but emphasized they expected no significant changes from today's tallies <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s party has been buffeted by ultra-conservatives calling for a tougher stance to win back voters from the Republicans, while the left has accused the <ORGANIZATION> CDU </ORGANIZATION> of already making too many concessions to the far-right. Republican victories date back to January, when the party won 11 of the 138 seats in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> legislature. Since then the party has gained city council seats in other major cities, including <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Dortmund </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> as well as in parts of <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION> state. Founded in 1983, the Republicans have run on a platform of law-and-order and slashing the number of foreign workers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. They won six seats in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, taking 7.1 percent of the vote in the West German voting in June. <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON> has said he expects the party will gain more than 5 percent of the vote in national voting in December 1990 to enter the federal Parliament in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. Several public opinion polls have indicated that may be an unrealistic goal. Another rightist extremist group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, won seven seats in the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> city council in March.

 Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had lunch with Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> today and received one of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s top honors _ the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum _ for promoting free trade and friendship with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The award ceremony and luncheon at the Imperial Palace in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> was the first meeting between the two men since <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> succeeded his father, the late Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, in January and since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> retired to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` I am humbled and deeply honored to have been awarded,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and Empress <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> looked on as palace Grand Master of Ceremonies <PERSON> Kiyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumiya </PERSON> presented the award to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, palace officials said. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Crown Prince <PERSON> Naruhito </PERSON> and Ambassador <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> also attended the ceremony and luncheon, they said on condition of anonymity. The Reagans last met the imperial couple in October 1987 when they made an official visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> received the award from the Japanese government for promoting peace and friendship with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and for working to protect the free trade system during his eight years in office, officials said. The last and only other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to receive the honor was <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. Later in the day, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> at the invitation of <ORGANIZATION> Fujisankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and the Japanese government, met with Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> and attended a dinner held by <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> in his honor. At the dinner, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> admired <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s popularity, noted the deepening of bilateral relations during his years in office and warmly congratulated <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on his award. `` I know that over the years, every relationship has its ups and downs. Even among the best of friends, there are sometimes issues which need careful and candid evaluation,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, alluding to often rocky trade issues. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Fujisankei </LOCATION> have refused to confirm reports he will receive about $ 2 million for his appearances on television and at charitable events during his Oct. 20-28 stay. Fujisankei, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest media group, has said it was spending $ 7 million on the visit. On Sunday, the group sponsored a gala benefit concert for the <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> attended by over 10,000 people. Like its chairman, <PERSON> Nobutaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Shikanai </PERSON>, many of Fujisankei's media outlets espouse conservatism and nationalism. At the time of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death on Jan. 7, the <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> generally carried less critical views of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s imperial system.

 Former federal judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who was removed from office last week after being impeached, filed Monday as a candidate in the 1990 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> governor's race. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, 53, filed with the state Division of Elections to open a campaign account as a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate. He has sought public office unsuccessfully on two prior occasions. `` I would be an inspirational leader for the people,'' said <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who added that the notoriety from his impeachment trial would benefit him in his effort to win the Democratic nomination. `` It gives me an immediate bounce,'' he said. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said more people in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> know him than his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opponents, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> and state Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. `` I got fired by people who did n't read or understand the dynamics of the evidence as it was presented,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said of his removal from <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` I believe myself to be a man of honor and integrity. I have not committed any crime at any time.'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said he would discuss the impeachment hearings early in his gubernatorial campaign, but hoped the focus would soon shift to matters relevant to the governor's race. `` My interests, I believe, are the interests of the people of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> ran unsuccessfully for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 and for the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in 1974. He said he would campaign on a platform of restructuring <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s government and tax base. He favors abolishing the cabinet and lieutenant governor's office and having a unicameral Legislature. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said he began thinking about the gubernatorial race six months ago. `` I had to face the reality that I would be removed from office,'' he said. Incumbent Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and state Sen. <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodson-Howard </PERSON> have announced they will run on the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> side of the race.

 A killer whale has been swimming alongside a Norwegian ferry for the past week, in what the captain said Monday looked like a case of whale courtship. `` It's hard to say who fell in love with whom,'' said <PERSON> Olav </PERSON> <PERSON> Mundal </PERSON>, captain of the ferry B-F Voksa. Passengers and crew are as taken with the black and white whale as the whale is with the black and white ship. <PERSON> Mundal </PERSON> said by radio telephone the whale seldom leaves the ferry's side as it sails a 12-mile route through a fjord near <LOCATION> Aalesund </LOCATION>. The 13-foot whale hugs the ship's hull, sometimes gently bumps against it, and often sprays passengers with water. School classes have been buying tickets on the ferry to see it. `` People are very interested. Sometimes when we dock there is a crowd of people waiting on the wharf for it,'' he said. The courtship does n't endanger the whale or the ship, he said. <PERSON> Mundal </PERSON> said the whale has not disappeared for more than a few hours at a time. It may have adopted the ship after straying from a killer whale flock seen in the area three weeks ago, he said.

<TEXT>
 Hungarians today for the first time officially marked their anti-Stalinist revolt that Soviet tanks crushed in 1956, with more than 100,000 people cheering for closer ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Over national television acting president <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON> proclaimed <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> a republic in a symbolic rejection of communist dominance, and church bells pealed across the country. `` As of today, our nation's ... name is the Republic of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON>, after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last week voted to change the name from `` People's Republic.'' Communists had renamed the country after assuming power in 1948. Hoots and whistles greeted <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON>' call for cooperation with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But the crowd, estimated at more than 100,000, cheered and clapped when he urged warmer ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We continue to view the uninterrupted development of our ties to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as in our nation's interests,'' <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON> said. `` At the same time, we also seek to improve -LRB- contacts -RRB- with the other superpower, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' A reference to planned democratic elections next year also drew prolonged applause. `` The Republic of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has become a state governed by law, where the values of ... -LRB- Western -RRB- democracy and democratic socialism are equally valid,'' Szueroes said. Many people sported lapel pins showing the red, white and green Hungarian flag with a jagged hole in the middle, symbolizing the communist emblem cut out during the revolt. Others displayed buttons with the pre-communist coat of arms that was resurrected briefly in 1956. It was one of the largest gatherings since Oct. 23, 1956, when an estimated 200,000 people marched on Parliament to press democratic demands. Szueroes' proclamation was a highlight of numerous officially organized events and of rallies staged by the political opposition to mark the anniversary. It was the latest step in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s rapid transition from 41 years of communist rule toward a multi-party democracy. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Slovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda today condemned the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s reform as `` a political coup d'etat'' turning <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> into a `` bourgeois-democratic republic.'' More than 1,000 people packed the St. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Basilica </PERSON> in downtown <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> and crowded outside the doors earlier today to hear a Mass and sing hymns for the thousands who fell during the revolt which began Oct. 23. Mothers paraded young girls, whose hair was festooned with ribbons in the red, white and green national colors, and thousands of flags flapped in the warm breeze throughout the capital. Police presence was low-key, with the usual sidearms and truncheons conspicuously absent from the belts of officers. One year ago, thousands of police moved in to block demonstrations of the the anniversary. The 1956 revolt, in which as many as 32,000 people died, is now considered a popular uprising after being condemned as a `` counter-revolution'' abetted from overseas by dark imperialist forces. On that day 33 years ago, mass student demonstrations calling for greater democracy, a multi-party system and the withdrawal of Soviet troops quickly escalated into armed clashes with Hungarian and Soviet troops. The revolt ended 12 days later, after Soviet tanks rumbled into the Hungarian capital and crushed all resistance. In the last three historic weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was dismantled and transformed into a Socialist party professing democratic ideals and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> rewrote the constitution to embrace multi-party democracy ahead of free elections next year. Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, in a televised address Sunday evening, said the parliamentary session marked the closing of `` an era in our history.'' He also said Hungarians today would be commemorating the `` sacrifices of 33 years ago.'' He said the anniversary was a reminder that `` we can never try to erase the past.'' Szueroes today provisionally assumes the powers of the newly expanded president until a head of state can be elected either later this year or after next year's parliamentary elections. The new <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is espousing democratic ideals, though it will continue in power until the parliamentary elections it has promised to hold by June. The party issued a statement Friday rejecting the Soviet intervention that crushed the revolt and opposing all external intervention or restrictions of sovereignty. On June 16, tens of thousands of Hungarians attended the funeral of <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, the leader of the 1956 revolt, after the government rehabilitated him. He was formally reburied in the same plot where his body was dumped in an unmarked grave after his execution for high treason in 1958. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> also summarily exonerated all those tried for roles in the uprising as well as all those who suffered reprisals between 1948 and 1962 _ the period now officially termed <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Stalinist period.

<HEAD>Walesa New Head of Solidarity Chapter in Lenin Shipyard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> promised workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> who elected him head of their local Solidarity chapter that he would mind their interests despite his many other duties, a newspaper reported Monday. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> declined an offer to become honorary chairman of the union chapter at the shipyard where he helped found the independent Solidarity movement nine years ago and unexpectedly decided to run for the office Saturday, according to the pro-Solidarity newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION>. The electrician defeated <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON>, a veteran shipyard worker and longtime fellow union activist, by a vote of 87-37. `` I do n't want honors, I do n't want to be artificial, I want to rule,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the workers, explaining why he did not want to become only the honorary chairman, according to <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION>. The Solidarity leader is still an employee of the shipyard, but he has been delegated for union work since Solidarity became legal again on April 17. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> served as unofficial chairman of the national Solidarity organization after the 1980 strikes that led to legalization of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent trade union. He was chosen Solidarity leader at a national congress in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> in 1981. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was the elected head of the shipyard chapter until the <ORGANIZATION> national </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> when he resigned from that post. <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON> was then elected leader of the shipyard chapter and served in that post until his defeat Saturday. Asked whether he would be able to reconcile his new job as head of the union chapter in the shipyard and his role as national union leader, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he would try to keep in permanent contact with his deputies in the shipyard and promised to visit the workers once a month. After martial law was declared on Dec. 13, 1981, to crush the union, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> guided the movement through nearly eight years of underground activity and participated in the two strikes at the shipyard in 1988 that prompted authorities to start a dialogue with the opposition. Two months of talks this spring resulted allowing the reinstatement of the union and democratic elections in June that brought victory to the Solidarity-led opposition and paved the way for a non-communist government. Some disgruntled Solidarity members say <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has too much power and want a national congress to be convened as soon as possible. <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s spokesman, said Sunday the congress is likely to be held in the spring, after Solidarity chapters have chosen their delegates.

<HEAD>Iran Links Western Hostage Release To Iranians Held In Lebanon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> today offered to help gain freedom for 18 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> releases frozen Iranian assets or helps resolve the cases of three kidnapped Iranians. He appeared to refer to Iranians kidnapped by the Lebanese Forces militia in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982, along with their <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> driver, a Shiite Moslem. All four are believed dead. Speaking to a news conference attended by mostly foreign reporters, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> also ruled out any participation by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s post-war reconstruction. `` I do n't think American companies can play any role in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' he said. Sitting behind a small table in the high-ceilinged hall of the presidential office in downtown <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> spoke in a soft voice, smiling frequently as he played with a string of worry beads. His remarks were translated by an interpreter. `` If the conditions are right we might be able to do something'' about the abducted Westerners, he said. It was not the first time <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has linked its help in releasing Western hostages to the unfreezing of the assets or the release of the Iranians kidnapped seven years ago. The hostages, who include eight Americans, are believed to be held by pro-Iranian groups. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said hostage-taking is an `` inhuman action'' that can produce no positive political results. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Our position has not changed. We do not link the Iranian assets to the hostages and we do not make deals for hostages.'' As for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s influence over the hostages, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We have always said we believe that they have an influence on the hostages, that they have considerable knowledge, but we ca n't gauge how specific that is.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has provided <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with all the information it has on Iranians kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Responding to a question from an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reporter, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said he had proposed `` two methods'' that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could use to facilitate release of the hostages, adding: `` The first is that as a sign of goodwill, you release our assets. This is something that you will have to do, and sooner or later you will be forced to do it. So do it now.'' `` Secondly, if you do not want to give us our money, at least you can get your agents, your lackeys in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to release our hostages. If you say they are not alive, at least you can give us back their bodies or show us their graves.'' The assets, estimated at more than $ 1 billion, have been frozen since students seized the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in 1979. Fifty-two Americans were held hostage there for 444 days. The Iranians kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982 are <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Motevaselian </PERSON>, commander of the contingent of Iranian Revolutionary Guards based in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>; Iranian Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Kazem </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhavan </PERSON>, a correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>; along with <PERSON> Rastegar </PERSON> <PERSON> Moqadam </PERSON>, their driver. All were kidnapped at a Lebanese Forces checkpoint 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Lebanese Forces commander <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> said in August 1988 that after he took over the militia in 1986 he found no trace of the missing men and blamed his predecessor, <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobeika </PERSON>, for their disappearance and apparent murder. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>'s disclosure was the first formal comment by the Lebanese Forces that it had been involved in the seizure of the missing Iranians. All four men are believed dead. Eighteen Westerners are held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>: eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian. The longest held is <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>NATO Defense Ministers Meet on Nuclear Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers, grappling with fast-paced changes in the Soviet bloc, probably will call for a fresh look at how much nuclear firepower should be kept in Western arsenals, officials say. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> will join defense chiefs of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for two days of nuclear strategy talks, beginning Tuesday on the southern coast of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. `` There are no major decisions required at this meeting,'' said a senior <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official. `` The nuclear affairs of the alliance are running along very smoothly at this time.'' Another official said: `` It will be a good occasion to take stock of nuclear matters.'' A third added, `` It's going to be a rather uneventful meeting, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.'' All spoke on condition of anonymity. The meeting should be free of the tensions marking previous sessions of the Nuclear Planning Group when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials clashed mostly with West Germans over development of a new theater nuclear missile. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other leaders of the 16-nation alliance resolved the dispute at their 40th anniversary summit in May. With that on the backburner, the defense ministers can discuss the dramatic events shaping East-West relations _ and how they should react. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> was expected to `` call attention to the very positive changes'' in the Soviet bloc countries, said the senior <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official. Another official suggested the ministers urge the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to do more in reducing its nuclear stockpile. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has promised to pull out 500 short-range nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this year. According to Western estimates, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has 1,450 short-range nuclear missile launchers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has 88 Lance launchers, most based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The ministers also were expected to discuss fresh contacts with East bloc officials. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> met recently with Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>. But it appeared the key outcome would be asking top aides to make a thorough study of the alliance's nuclear role in an era of reduced tensions. An official said the ministers would likely want `` an examination of the implications of an agreement on conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ... for alliance nuclear forces.'' <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> negotiators are bargaining with the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to reach a quick agreement on sweeping reductions in conventional, or non-nuclear, weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The positive nature of those -LRB- talks -RRB- gives us some hope that we can look forward to a reduction in conventional forces and subsequent to that a reduction in nuclear forces,'' said the official. The deeper the conventional cuts, he said, the greater the impact on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear strategy. `` I certainly would n't rule out that at some point in the future we decide certain elements of our nuclear posture are not necessary,'' he said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- I think we're going to have to see some major changes on the other side before that's true.'' He also said the allies `` see no time in which we will not need some nuclear weapons.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also was expected to bring its allies up to date on bargaining with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on reducing long-range nuclear forces. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders in May worked out a compromise on negotiating with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> cuts in conventional and nuclear arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The formula links reductions in conventional forces to the start of talks on trimming short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had demanded immediate negotiations with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact on slashing theater nuclear missiles. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials said attention should be focused first on cutting the East's enormous superiority in conventional arms. They also agreed the question of deploying a new, more powerful generation of surface-to-surface nuclear missiles would be dealt with in 1992. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had wanted a strong endorsement of its development program to replace aging Lance missiles. The work is designed to more than triple the missile's range to just under the limits of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. Defense ministers meet twice a year to discuss nuclear matters. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which is outside <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s integrated military structure, does not attend. <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, which has no armed forces, has observer status.

 Sixty-two Vietnamese refugees arrived in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> after being adrift at sea for 52 days during which they say their crippled boat was deliberately towed away from <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> waters, refugee officials said today. Six of the group died while their boat drifted near <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, according to a statement from the office of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. The refugees were brought here by the Greek-owned vessel <PERSON> Anezina </PERSON>, flying the <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> flag, on Sunday, the statement said. Many had to be assisted, and 12 were taken immediately to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where one pregnant woman in her thirties remains in critical condition, it said. The woman's 4-year-old daughter was in satisfactory condition, the statement added. Sixty-eight refugees left Cuu Long in southwest <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Sept. 1 in a 46-foot boat whose engine broke down after three days at sea. The refugees reported they survived on rain water, but on Oct. 14 one man died of dehydration and starvation. The next day a Malaysian vessel spotted the group and brought them water, boiled rice and vegetables, the report said. `` They claim to have been told they would be towed to shore. A tow rope was attached to their boat and they were towed for approximately 19 hours. The tow rope was cut without warning and the boat set adrift,'' the statement said. `` Two more people, a man and a woman, died of dehydration and starvation.'' The Anezina rescued them about 75 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION> shortly before another woman died, leaving two young chidren, the statement said.

<BYLINE>Key Trade Route Reopens After 5 Years of Rebel Sabotage ^By MELINDA

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>'s shortest and cheapest route to the sea, the <LOCATION> Nacala </LOCATION> railway line through <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, has reopened for the first time after five years of rebel sabotage. The government has urged <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>'s merchants to reroute external trade through the Indian ocean port of <ORGANIZATION> Nacala </ORGANIZATION>, which is only 500 miles from this land-locked country _ a distance three times shorter than the current route through <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Tobacco, tea and sugar are the main exports likely to be transported on the <ORGANIZATION> Nacala </ORGANIZATION> line. Tobacco alone earned 60 percent of this impoverished nation's export income last year No goods have yet traveled on the line, which reopened last week. But armor-plated locomotives have made test runs since late May, according to a diplomatic source in the <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Lilongwe </LOCATION>. Since 1984, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>'s traditional rail routes to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> ports of <LOCATION> Nacala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION> have been closed because of repeated attacks by <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas fighting against the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION> government in <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, the capital of neighboring <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> depended on links through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to carry more than 90 percent of its trade, as well as a new northern route through <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> that carries the remaining traffic. Until now, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> paid one of the costliest transport bills in the world, amounting to more than $ 100 million last year, according to Finance Minister <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimango </PERSON>. The new northern route through <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> is being rehabilitated for $ 160 million. Freight will be transported in stages by road to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, container vessel across the water, by road again to the Tanzanian border, and then by the <LOCATION> Tazara </LOCATION> railway to the port of <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> es </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salaam </LOCATION>. Once the <ORGANIZATION> Nacala </ORGANIZATION> line is at full steam, it would be able to carry more than three-quarters of <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>'s trade and cut its transport bill by two-thirds, said a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Malawi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railways </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1983, the nine-nation <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> largely has been responsible for restoring <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>'s lifeline to the sea. The regional bloc, which includes <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, has pledged to loosen <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s traditional stranglehold on their economies. The line is guarded by some 1,000 Malawian soldiers _ a fifth of the national army _ and an undisclosed number of Frelimo troops. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are contributing only small amounts to the development of the line, but their governments are providing uniforms, trucks and communications equipment to Malawian troops.

 Are you `` healthy and wealthy'' or `` young and reckless?'' Perhaps `` sedentary but striving'' is a better description, or `` fat and frustrated.'' Those are among the categories of Americans developed in a survey that found middle-aged women with college degrees lead the healthiest lifestyles, while white, male, blue-collar workers have the worst health habits. The largest group, about 68 million, drink less and exercise more than the average, but pay little attention to their diet, according to the report `` The Fit and the Fat.'' The survey found a sizable group of people who want to be healthy but lack the resources, both personal and financial, while many others know what to do to be healthy but lack motivation, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dybdahl </PERSON>, director of the study. The study, based on a survey of 1,250 randomly selected Americans, wder range of stories.

 With both the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejecting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals for dialogue, efforts to arrange <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations appear to have reached a low point. Among the reasons for the stalemate is the fierce opposition of hard-liners on both sides, and the lack of strong leadership that can overcome the resistance. `` We are not in an era of great leadership,'' said <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sela </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` The problem is that both sides are in a quandary because of internal politics.'' <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalist, said `` there is no farsightedness in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, not enough statesmanship in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and general apathy in the Arab world.'' In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, 74, has portrayed Egyptian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to bring about talks with Palestinians as disguised attempts at forcing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Digging in his heels, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in a speech last week that `` this is our land from the dawn of history, and it will be so always. We will not be pushed nor pressured.'' However, Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> today opened fresh debate about the latest <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> proposals by saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was considering them despite <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s objections The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals `` have not been rejected or accepted. Nobody has been authorized to accept or reject them,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told 500 high school students in the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Kfar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, adding that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s latest ideas should be put to a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> vote. While <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has eased his rhetoric following criticism by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, his ability to compromise is limited because hawks in his own right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, led by ex-Defense Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, have put conditions on his peace proposals. The hawks oppose trading land for peace, curtailing the building of Jewish settlements in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> or even starting talks until the 22-month Palestinian uprising has been put down. Part of the reason for a lack of progress, however, also lies in <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> himself. He lacks the strength of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> founder and ex-Premier <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, who arm-wrestled skeptical colleagues into making peace with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1979. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is also viewed by some analysts as an inflexible ideologue who did not support the peace treaty with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and who does not want to risk getting into any process now that would lead to yielding land or allowing exiled Palestinians to return. `` <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> sees clearly the eventual result and does n't want to get into it. It is not a matter of discussions and proposals,'' said <PERSON> Sela </PERSON>, the political scientist. The rival <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> advocates negotiations without further delay. But its leader, Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, has lacked the muscle in his party to force the issue, although there are hints he may take action if <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> returns empty-handed from a trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next month. The internal <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> debate is almost as intense as that in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The only united stand came in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, recently where <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s compromise proposals as an attempt to circumvent the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has spent most of his time battling hard-liners within his movement rather than assuaging Israeli doubts about his sincerity in pledging to renounce terror and accepting the Jewish state. Palestinian Islamic fundamentalists have rejected any idea of a peace agreement, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, a leading <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leftist, has threatened to assassinate <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> if the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> president continues to promote a <LOCATION> Palestinian-Isreli </LOCATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. The confusing rhetoric from the Palestinian side has failed to persuade the Israeli in the street of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s sincerity in seeking peace or his ability to live up to an agreement. Hence there is little pressure on <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to make concessions or rein in his own hard-liners. Arab countries, with the exception of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, have been silent or negative about the peace efforts. This has reinforced Israeli doubts about Arab intentions and has led to bitterness on the part of Palestinians. <PERSON> Saeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON>, a leading Palestinian activist and political scientest at An <ORGANIZATION> Najah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries have failed to provide adequate political or financial backing to the Palestinians. He says <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states fear a successful uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could prompt challenges to their own regimes. `` The Arab masses might imitate and revolt against their regimes. That's why the Arab world does not support the uprising,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also has been the target of criticism from Palestinians and Israelis for not taking a more active role. In an editorial, the Labor-affiliated <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the proposal to hold <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> talks in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> about <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan for elections in the occupied territories was headed for failure `` The responsibility for that is mainly with the Americans,'' the newspaper said, predicting a slow slide into violence unless the <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> stakes its prestige on forcing agreement.

<HEAD>Jurors' Backgrounds Reportedly Probed in Civil Rights Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former official on a defunct segregationist panel says it investigated the backgrounds of jurors who were selected for a 1964 trial of a man accused of killing civil rights leader <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Erle </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the former executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sovereignty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which spied on civil rights groups in the 1960s, says that while the review of potential jurors' backgrounds in the first of two trials `` was unethical ... it was n't -LRB- jury -RRB- tampering.'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> also said in a newspaper interview Monday there was nothing in the commission's still-secret records that could be used if the case were reopened against <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, the man charged with the murder. <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> was tried twice in 1964 by all-white juries for the June 12, 1963, slaying of <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, field secretary of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> was gunned down outside his <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> home. Both trials ended in deadlocked juries. Prosecutors contended that <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>'s fingerprint was on the sight of a gun found in bushes near the slaying. Witnesses placed <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>'s car near the scene that night. A federal judge will decide whether to take action regarding the findings of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into possible illegal leaks of materials from <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sovereignty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> records. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said there was a request by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to look into a report that some information may have been released. The segregationist panel was created in 1956 and infiltrated civil rights groups until its demise in 1973, when then-Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> vetoed its funding. The 1977 Legislature ordered the commission's files sealed until 2027. <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> ruled this summer that the panel's principal records, held in a vault at the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> and History in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, should be made public. However, the records remain sealed pending an appeal in the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> by the Rev.

 Atlantis' astronauts swooped out of orbit to a safe, early landing in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> today after a five-day mission that sent the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft streaking across the solar system toward Jupiter. Commander <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON> guided the 97-ton winged spaceship to a stop on a hard clay lakebed runway at 9:33 a.m. PDT, concluding a flight that covered 1.7 million miles. They landed into a light headwind of about 8 mph. `` Congratulations on an outstanding mission,'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, a spacecraft communicator at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, told the shuttle crew. `` You've extended the shuttle's reach to the outer planets.'' `` It's nice to be home,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> replied. The space travelers remained in the cabin about 45 minutes, shutting down systems, then made the traditional walkaround inspection of their spaceship. Except for some minor scratches on heat protection tiles, the craft looked to be in good shape. They rode a van to a nearby building where they showered and underwent brief medical examinations. They were to fly back to their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> later in the day. The five astronauts started their descent from orbit an hour before touchdown when <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> fired Atlantis' braking rockets 180 miles above the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. That slowed the ship's 17,400 mph speed by 219 mph and started it on a fiery, hourlong dive through the atmosphere. Two sonic booms crackled over the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert as Atlantis glided powerless through the clear sky, making wide circles to reduce speed as it descended. <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> decided Sunday to shorten the shuttle's trip by two 90-minute orbits because the calmest winds at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> were predicted early in the day. Weather officials said the winds at the time of touchdown were well within safety limits for a shuttle landing. Controllers radioed weather information to the astronauts up to moment of engine ignition and told them the best wind conditions were on lakebed runway 23, one of six available at Edwards. If the winds had been too strong, the landing could have been postponed until Tuesday or Wednesday. As the five astronauts were ending their journey, the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe they dispatched on Wednesday was more than 1 million miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on a six-year voyage to explore the mysteries of giant Jupiter. The astronauts adjusted their schedule for the early landing by going to bed 2 -LCB- hours early Sunday night and 90 minutes early the previous night. They were awakened early today to strains of `` Fly Like an Eagle'' by the <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Band </PERSON>. `` Good morning, Atlantis,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> radioed to the craft. `` Well I'm not sure we're flying like eagles, but it's been fun so far,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> replied. On Sunday, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who flew a 1985 shuttle mission, described what today's re-entry would be like. `` Re-entry heating is rather spectacular if you see it in the darkness. ... It looks like you're inside a fire looking out,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said during a television interview from space. He described the fireball created by the friction created when the shuttle plunges through the atmosphere. Summing up the mission, flight director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> termed it `` very successful. We had only minor problems with the orbiter; the science return was very good, and <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> was released on time.'' The main goal of the five-day mission was to deploy the nuclear-powered <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>, and that was accomplished about 6 -LCB- hours after blastoff Wednesday from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The $ 1.5 billion probe continued to operate flawlessly as it raced across the solar system on a 2.4-billion-mile roundabout journey to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. Traveling at nearly 9,000 mph, the probe had logged more than 1 million miles early today. `` We all certainly breathed a sigh of relief when it went according to plan and we kept hearing all the good news from the ground that the spacecraft had done all the things that it had to do to get on its way,'' astronaut <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> said Sunday during an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. Also aboard Atlantis were <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. If all goes according to plan, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will take six years to reach <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>, where it's expected to give the best look yet at another planet and provide clues to the origin of the universe. Before it gets there, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will swoop past <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> once and <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> twice to gain momentum from the planets' gravity for the long voyage. The astronauts also conducted several scientific experiments, including one that measured the Earth's protective ozone layer. Two other shuttle experiments involved processing materials and growing corn plants. The astronauts also photographed lightning systems for a weather project and grew ice crystals for a student experiment. Time also was spent photographing various parts of the world with the IMAX movie camera. The footage will be used for a documentary film about <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. On Sunday, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON> successfully tested Atlantis' flight control systems and fired one of its steering thrusters to prepare for the trip home

<HEAD>Chinese Gov't, Dissidents, Turn to East Bloc for Comfort</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Condemned by most capitalist countries for crushing pro-democracy protests, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has turned to the socialist world for support and comfort. So have its now-silenced protesters. Since the June army attack on student-led protesters caused <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the West to halt high-level exchanges, Chinese diplomats have busied themselves with meetings with East bloc and Third World envoys. Chinese Vice Premier <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in October and exchanged condolences with then-East German President <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> over their mutual problems from `` imperialist class opponents.'' A succession of Soviet and East European scientific, educational or <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> delegations have visited <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, many expressing agreement with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s position that reforms are intended to strengthen socialism, not topple it. But back in the visiting delegations' home capitals, changes are occurring that can be of little comfort to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government but warm the hearts of the dissidents. The widening of perestroika in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the rejection of communism in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the mass exodus of East Germans have reinforced some dissidents' belief that they, not the conservatives, will eventually prevail. `` We are watching what happens very closely,'' said a woman intellectual who supported <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s democracy movment. `` There's a tide sweeping the socialist countries, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> ca n't shut itself off from it. It ca n't become isolated again, even if it tries,'' she said. Several former student protesters said the East Europeans' demand for reform reinforced their beliefs that radical change is necessary if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is to catch up with the developed world `` It shows that socialism has failed everywhere, not just in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' and not just because of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s size and historic backwardness, said one. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s TV news has ignored the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> marches _ dissidents believe because of the similarities to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s mass protests for democracy in the spring. In both countries, angry populations expressed impatience with aging, out-of-touch leaders. Both East German and Chinese youth used visits from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to call for reforms modeled on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which provides all foreign dispatches, has carried only a few brief, official East German reports on the marches. Its other reports from the East bloc have created the impression that old-fashioned, hardline Marxism predominates in the socialist world. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> has quoted East German attacks on the Western media, a Bulgarian condemnation of Western human rights groups and <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovakian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>' pledge to `` never concede to anti-socialist forces.'' `` In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the capitalist road wo n't do,'' read a headline in Monday's <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, quoting conservative Politburo member <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>. Other headlines on the same page read, `` <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Pravda warns Western countries: do n't plot to rock the socialist boat,'' and `` Yugoslav people's army opposes multiparty rule.'' Chinese say they follow developments by reading between the lines of <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> reports and listening to <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> radio reports. A Western diplomat said that in internal debates some Chinese theorists have dusted off the word `` revisionist'' to denounce the reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` Revisionist'' was the late Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s word for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which he accused of being too conciliatory toward the West. `` There are some arguing that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should come out in the open and draw attention to the split in the international communist movement, and that the ones who are faithful should draw together,'' the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He listed <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> among the hardline `` faithful.'' But he predicted that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s current official stance _ that each socialist country must follow its own road _ will prevail for practical reasons: snubbed by the West, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can not afford to snub its remaining friends.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The legendary <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> banking family on Monday ended an 88-year absence from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by opening a new office in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, the famed Jewish family's historic hometown. The <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> family that had lived in this Main River city since the Middle Ages closed its last German firm in 1901, when financial activity had migrated elsewhere and family interests in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> eclipsed those in their traditional home. The new <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> office, located at <ORGANIZATION> Friedrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> 48, will deal primarily in corporate financing, rather than consumer banking. <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> offices in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> joined forces to open the new office in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Trott </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauff </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trott </PERSON> said the city views the opening of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> operation as `` a positive signal in connection with <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> plans for free trade in the community by 1992.'' `` It is a joining together of tradition and the future,'' <PERSON> Trott </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Rothschilds </ORGANIZATION> have a magical meaning for <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> as the original bankers here.'' <PERSON> Hauff </PERSON> joined Barons <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Amschel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in opening ceremonies for the new office in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION> district. The office will initially be staffed by three people under the supervision of <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Stromeyer </PERSON>, a former managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehmen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. Plans call for the office's activities to include business mergers and acquisitions, in addition to regular portfolio management, banking sources say. <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> <PERSON> Amschel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, the son of a Jewish money-changer in the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> ghetto, started the family financial empire in the 18th century. The <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> family later expanded its banking business to other major cities, including <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> eventually became <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s banking center, and in 1901, when <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> died leaving no male heirs, the family closed its operations in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` For a <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> family member, the return to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> is a meaningful event,'' <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, associated manager of <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cie. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, told reporters at a press conference.

The <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> family gained prominence by financing such projects as the construction of European railroads and the British military campaign that led to the final defeat of <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> in 1815.

<DATELINE>SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Wormhoudt </PERSON> had planned a party this fall in the heart of her city. But now's not the time for revelry _ rubble and ruin surround her. The downtown of this coastal community is littered with caved-in buildings, shattered windows and piles of brick _ stark tesimony to 15 seconds of nature's fury. One week ago, the earthquake struck <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, but if the shock is over, the painful reality is just settling in for the mayor. `` It's really hard and gets harder each time I see it,'' she said, her eyes brimming with tears as she surveyed the ravaged <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION>, the downtown business district. `` This week people are really taking care of each other,'' she said. `` Next week, we're not the media's favorite, their 15-second sound bite. Everyone will go away. And we'll settle in the long haul putting it back together.'' Rebuilding is a far cry from what this community of 50,000 had planned for this fall. In a few weeks, <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> was supposed to be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the mall, several blocks of shops and offices in renovated wood and stucco buildings. `` This was a dying downtown, this was a downtown that had lost its vitality,'' the mayor said. `` People had creativity and vsion,'' rebuilding and renovatng, adding greenery and pedestrian-only areas, benches and outdoor cafes. Instead of celebrating, the city is mourning the three people who died here a week ago and trying to assess the damage. Thirty percent of the stores may be lost in this business district, part of which is cordoned off with yellow police tape. That's just part of the devastation. Total quake damage in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> has been estimated at $ 160 million _ about two-thirds of it private property. Still, the mayor _ serving a rotating one-year term from <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ is confident the city can rebound and the business core can be rebuilt. But she said timing is critical. `` It's going to take massive infusion of assistance from every level of government to get the city back on its feet again,'' she said. `` If that help is n't immediate, it's not going to do any good. These are people that ca n't stay shut six to 12 months. It's got to be now. The mayor conveyed that message to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Health and Human Services Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who made separate trips to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> in recent days. Business leaders are already talking about setting up temporary headquarters for merchants. `` There's a lot more cooperative spirit then there was on Monday,'' the day before the quake, said <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rittenhouse </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Downtown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruz </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everybody has put their other problems behind them.'' But anxiety remains, especially among some small merchants near the mall. `` We were a flea on the hide of the elephant,'' <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> said to explain her used bookstore's relationship to the mall. `` Now the elephant's gone. Will people come back? What will they come back to?'' The mall, along with the wharf, beach and boardwalk, are among the many attractions in a community that evokes images of the'60s. It's not uncommon to see pony-tailed men in tie-dyed shirts or a rainbow-painted <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> bus cruising the streets. `` We're a time-warped kind of town,'' said resident <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>. It's also a university community, with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, and politically active. `` There's a protest going on all the time here,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>. `` Whatever your cause is, it's OK.'' And the mall was not only the business core, but a social congregating spot `` It's heartbreaking,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` Some of us will be forced into a totally new lifestyle.'' `` It certainly will never be the same, all those wonderful little stores,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON>. `` The old lady wo n't be recognizable anymore. She'll get a new dress.'' But that's not necessarily bad, said <PERSON> Rittenhouse </PERSON>, who lost four buildings in the quake. `` The mall,'' he said, `` is going to come back bigger and better. The majority of them -LRB- merchants -RRB- are pretty tough people. They're already saying tell us when we can come in to pick up the pieces so we can start over again.''

 Leggy fashions with a light-as-air appeal took over in summer ready-to-wear shows Monday by fashion heavyweights <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> at Dior. Luxury fabrics and curvy silhouettes are ruling the runways as strong silhouettes are bowing to the feminine appeal of bows and softness. Lagerfeld turned the Chanel woman into a young girl with a raft of flared shorts, tiny skirts, beautiful fitted long or short jackets, and some asymmetrical draping to vary the menu. It was all a shadow game of black and white, pepped up by pastels and some hot-color prints, as <LOCATION> Lagerfeld </LOCATION> played with a girlish silhouette, outlining typically Chanel jackets in black passementerie piping. He led off with a transparent-opaque contrast in asymmetrically draped chiffon skirts under piped white jackets, later varying the idea with transparent duster jackets over V-necked tunics and micro-minis. This coy idea of pairing see-throughs with solids is a solid hit in most <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> collections, and most beautifully done at <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION>. Some of the jacket ideas rich women will want to wear or copy include tulip or decollete shapes done up with seed pearl patch pockets and piping _ or sexier versions in black satin with jet-bead trim and chains at the waist. The youth kick here means that the newest <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> bag is worn as a chic biker's pouch on a belt. The regular chain belt has become a bold hip chain with huge links. The older Chanel client should n't panic. There's lots of choice, especially in the ivory and white suits that do n't have to be worn open to show the bosom. <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON> also offered soft, semi-transparent blouses with floppy bows or deep-draped decolletes and dozens of lovely, long pajamas. <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON>'s first ready-to-wear collection for Dior also was a symphony in grays, black and white, beginning with tiny-checked suits and flared shortie coats. He too showed shorts, but topped them with billowy chiffon babydoll jackets, raincoats and artists' smock tops. The Ferre signature big bow here became so outsized in organza and taffeta that it made the strong silhouette of the outfits. The gift blouses were off-shoulder organza with big puffed sleeves, or a fitted lace version, with black linen shorts or long pants. The youth kick here became black workout suits, with black leather jackets, or with ruffled wraparound stoles and skirts for evening. Color finally came out at Dior in shades of periwinkle blue with polka dots, plus some fitted linen or silk tulip jackets in tomato, bright yellow and violet, often over black pants. For informal beachwear, <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> offered bikinis and one-piece ivory or off-white maillot swimsuits topped with terrycloth. Like <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarlazzi </PERSON>, he also used some hemstitched, handkerchief-draped outfits right out of the linen closet. Designer <PERSON> Hanae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mori </PERSON> celebrated her 35 years in the industry with fashions that look younger than ever. Last week she became a Knight of the Legion of Honor for her years as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Chambre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicale </ORGANIZATION>, the powerful fashion association. Her sportier clothes were excellent in some soft day wear, with short skirts, wide shorts, long and flared skirts in striped chiffons with a <LOCATION> Deauville </LOCATION> regatta appeal. Her gray and white cloud prints and graphic Kabuki faces on billowy kimono tops nevertheless did n't hide the female form. It came out in fitted bustier trouser suits and fitted suits with skirts above the knee _ younger than <PERSON> Mori </PERSON>'s usual styles. She too went overboard for bows. She put her signature butterfly bow on piped, colorful or navy linen suits, then the bow turned giant on layers of chiffon in two colors for an iridescent evening effect.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said Monday he will remain `` a simple <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk'' despite winning the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, but it will make the world more aware of the Tibetan struggle against Chinese rule. `` I will not be a different person,'' the Tibetan spiritual and temporal leader said at his first public address since returning to his exile home in <LOCATION> Dharmsala </LOCATION> after the Nobel Prize was announced Oct. 5. `` I will remain the same galong -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk -RRB-, <PERSON> Tenzin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyatso </PERSON>, whether someone curses or praises me.'' He told a crowd of 4,000 Tibetans celebrating the 29th anniversary of the Tibetan Children's Village that the Nobel Prize would make the Tibetan cause better known. `` Tibetans in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> today are undergoing a very difficult period in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s modern history,'' the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said. `` Martial law continues in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> and hundreds of Tibetans have been arrested and and equal number have been killed.'' The children's village, sprawling across a rocky ridge in the <LOCATION> Himalayan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> foothills </LOCATION>, is home for 1,700 Tibetan children, including about 500 who have been smuggled out of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in recent years to live in the Tibetan culture their parents fear will be denied them under Chinese rule. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> 30 years ago when Chinese troops surrounded his palace in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> after a failed Tibetan uprising. His followers set up a government-in-exile in <LOCATION> Dharmsala </LOCATION>, 300 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government, which claims <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is an ancient and integral part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, has denounced the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> as interference in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> and the Tibetan government-in-exile say <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> was a separate and independent state before Chinese troops arrived in 1950.

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lt. Gov. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> is striving to be the nation's first elected black governor, but has avoided emphasizing his race in a campaign without even a drive to register black voters. The 58-year-old Democrat who grew up in the segregated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> has conducted a campaign designed to appeal to the moderate, urban voters who helped put him in the state's No. 2 office in 1985, when he got 44 percent of the white vote. But he showed a rare moment of anger on a matter close to the hearts of black voters last week when his Republican opponent, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, invoked the name of slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in a televised debate. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> told <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a 47-year-old former state attorney general, that the late Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> cast a veto `` that you encouraged'' of a bill to create a holiday honoring King. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> pushed for years for a King state holiday. On Monday, at a rally at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> criticized a <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> proposal to limit out-of-state admissions to 10 percent at state-supported universities and colleges. `` This university's richness and diversity are a result of people coming from all over the world,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> told about 250 students at the rally. For the most part, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s political success has been built on a mixture of playing by the rules of the mostly white power structure while challenging the establishment on occasion. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> played little part in the civil rights movement that divided his home state in the 1950s and'60s. He has stayed away from national black leaders such as <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, winner of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s 1988 presidential primary. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> did not endorse <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has not been invited to campaign here this year on his behalf. `` I'm running a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> campaign,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said, a comment directed at President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s two campaign trips to the state to support <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. When he first ran for the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1969, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was chiefly known only as a criminal trial lawyer in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. But he became a symbol to <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> blacks, defeating two white candidates and taking the oath as the first black member of the chamber since Reconstruction. About 17 percent of the state's 2.7 million voters are black. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> allied himself with a group of younger Democrats who were about to overthrow the old-line conservative leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Eventually he rose to chairman of four committees, including the powerful Rules panel, which makes committee assignments. He became identified with the King holiday bill, which eventually became law, and an unsuccessful effort to change the state song, `` Carry Me Back to <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' because of racially offensive lyrics. Sometimes, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> turned against his allies. In 1982, he single-handedly scuttled the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidacy of <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>, who was then-Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>'s choice for the nomination. <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON> offended <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> by praising the two men who held the seat for a half-century: <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> Sr. and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, whose legacy included resistance to school integration. <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> released a series of letters in 1986 in which the former governor, now a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, accused <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> of being ungrateful and unreliable. He took the action after <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s top aides said <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> was getting too much credit for <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s 1985 victory. `` We've had differences and we've had serious differences,'' <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> said. `` But notwithstanding that, I'm still in <PERSON> Doug </PERSON>'s corner.'' Still, <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> has criticized both campaigns this year for focusing too much on abortion. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who has used the Robb-Wilder feuds as fuel in his campaign, said the abortion criticism was directed at <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, who has run television ads that point out <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s anti-abortion views. A Wilder aide disagreed with <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, saying voters consider the issue important. But <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> scarcely mentioned abortion in the debate last week. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> won the endorsement Sunday of the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>, a week after <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> got the nod from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>ANC Leaders Hold Strategy Meeting, Unhindered by Police</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eight African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaders, including seven freed from prison this month, held a strategy meeting Monday, unhindered by police even though their movement remains outlawed. A statement issued after the meeting said the men would consult with exiled officials of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and would address policy issues Sunday at a mass rally at a soccer stadium near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The meeting marked a reunion for the seven recently released men and a colleague, <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, who was freed from prison in 1987. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, 79, has been barred from traveling and attending political gatherings since his release, but the government Sunday lifted the restrictions for one week. He flew to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> on Monday from his hometown of Port <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. The other seven were released unconditionally and have spoken out freely on behalf of their guerrilla movement. They have endorsed the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s use of violence as part of its campaign to end white-minority domination and have demanded a series of concessions from the government as a precondition for negotiations. The eight men met with other anti-apartheid leaders for more than three hours behind closed doors at a community center in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. They engaged in `` an in-depth exploration of the way forward,'' according to a statement issued by a coalition of activists. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> and five of those freed this month received life sentences in 1964, along with paramount <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, after being convicted of treason for planning anti-government sabotage. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> remains imprisoned, although the government is considering his release. His freed co-defendants include <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, 77; <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlangeni </PERSON>, 63; <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Mhlaba </PERSON>, 68; <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kathrada </PERSON>, 60; and <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Motsaoledi </PERSON>, 65. Also released Oct. 15 and present at Monday's meeting were <PERSON> Wilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkwayi </PERSON>, 66, convicted of sabotage in a separate 1964 trial, and <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, 80, who began a five-year sentence for terrorism in 1985. The unconditional release of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders and the government's decision to allow Sunday's rally have been depicted by South African newspapers as a de facto legalization of the movement. Government officials have made clear in recent days they no longer expect the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> to make a formal repudiation of violence as a precondition for joining negotiations. President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said Monday that groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> group could join the political process by committing themselves to the concept of peaceful solutions. `` If perspective participants in the negotiation process insist on victories before entering negotiations, success will evade us,'' he told a party congress. `` What is necessary is a change of heart.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, if it distanced itself from violence, could help achieve its demand for lifting of the state of emergency. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has offered to negotiate a new constitution that will extend political rights to the disenfranchised black majority. He envisions a system which stops short of one-person, one-vote and provides whites with some type of veto power over major policy decisions.

 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has decided to start selling picture postal cards for the first time, entering a business private firms have found lucrative for decades. The government agency will issue only a few cards, however. It says it does n't plan on jumping into the market to compete nationwide for sales of the cards that are tourist favorites, bearing beautiful photos of local attractions in cities across the land, to make the folks back home envious. But visitors to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and others interested in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> landmarks, will be able to purchase two official government picture postal cards featuring the White House and the Jefferson Memorial. The White House card will go on sale Nov. 30 and the Jefferson Memorial card Dec. 2, both being issued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The cards will sell for 50 cents apiece which includes 15-cents postage. The government has sold plain postal cards for years, of course, and recently many have carried colorful commemorative designs in the corner. The new cards merely expand that to photos filling one side of the card. Privately made cards will remain on sale, of course. Buyers will still have a wide choice of post cards featuring many different photos of the White House and Jefferson Memorial. The difference will be that the two postal cards, sold by the government, include the 15-cent postage already printed on the card, while a stamp has to be added to privately produced cards.

<TEXT>
 Workers raced ahead of a storm Monday to lower a 100-ton section of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> to a barge, but then suffered a frustrating delay when choppy seas kept the barge from moving to shore. A portion of the troubled bridge over troubled water collapsed like a trap door in Tuesday's earthquake, closing it to the 260,000 vehicles that cross it each day. Engineers could not get a close-up look at the damaged sections Monday morning because the rain and high wind that wracked the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area forced the barge to cling to a <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> tower for safety, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. Officials hope to reuse the steel portions of the road section. `` This is a very key element in this whole transportation system in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION>,'' said department spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Halligan </PERSON>. `` It is incumbent to get it open in a minimum time.'' Repair time for the double-decked bridge remains about four weeks, but <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials admitted Monday that the target was largely a motivational tool. `` If we put a goal of three months it would be three months,'' <PERSON> Halligan </PERSON> said. The department set a Nov. 16 goal for the reopening, but the work may take longer, perhaps six weeks, he said. It is expected to cost $ 1 million. There has been considerable skepticism about the department's repair prediction, with some officials of other agencies estimating the work would take several months Without the bridge, thousands of commuters are forced onto other jam-packed bridges or to use public transportation. <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials also expressed satisfaction at the decision to remove a 100-ton slab from the bridge in the dark early Monday, just a few hours before a storm struck the Bay area. The wind and rain would have prevented the dangerous and delicate work later, <PERSON> Halligan </PERSON> said. A portion of the upper level, 50 feet long and five lanes across, had been sawed in half to make it easier to remove. The first half was lowered 200 feet to the barge on Sunday afternoon, and then a crane had to be moved to the other side of the bridge and set up again for the second half. For 53 years, the 8.5-mile-long bridge has been the main link between <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude earthquake dislodged a portion of the upper deck and sent it slamming onto the lower portion. The lower section is considered destroyed and will have to be removed and replaced, officials have said. Nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge provided the first graphic illustration of the magnitude of Tuesday's quake. The bridge also had been a symbol for the 1989 World Series between the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION>. But its closure contributed to Sunday's decision to delay resumption of the seven-game baseball championship until Friday.

Many of the participants wore buttons inscribed with `` <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Connection,'' signifying they had lost friends of relatives in the terrorist attack on the Marine barracks in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Oct. 23, 1983. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Muffler </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, was one of the 241 servicemen killed when a suicide bomber drove a bomb-laden truck crashed through the barracks' gates. Fundamentalist Shiites claimed responsibility. Mrs. <PERSON> Muffler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> resident, said families stay in touch with each other through a three-times-a-year newsletter. `` The pain is still fresh,'' said <PERSON> Aphrodite </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsaris </PERSON>, whose daughter, <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON>, died when a bomb exploded on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> last December. But the incident has given the victims `` a renewed resolve to effect change,'' replacing terrorism with peace, she said. The event was sponsored by No Greater Love, a non-profit, humanitarian organization that tries to help the victims of terrorism.

 A decision by <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> to make it harder for Poles to visit the Soviet Baltic republic was denounced in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s press Monday as discriminatory and `` political schizophrenia.'' The restrictions could further strain relations between the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc neighbors whose histories are closely connected and who are in the forefront of change in the communist world. Some Poles have voiced concern about the treatment of the ethnic Polish minority in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> holds bitter memories of historic Polish dominance, including a 1920 invasion in which <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> seized <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> and held it until 1939. The current dispute, while economic in origin, underscores how the decline of strict <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> control in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is allowing repressed nationalist tensions to emerge. Under the restrictions announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, Poles and other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc residents are allowed only one visit to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> a year, visitors are barred from mailing parcels to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, currency must be changed to rubles when entering <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, and regular train service between <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> is down to once a day. The pro-Solidarity newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> ran a dispatch on the restrictions under the headline, `` Stop Tourist.'' The communist youth newspaper Sztandar Mlodych asked Monday that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> take `` quick diplomatic action.'' `` Erecting at our borders more and more obstructive barriers ... represents a kind of political schizophrenia,'' it said. `` The resolution ... simultaneously causes surprise and alarm,'' it said. `` This is another in a long list of decisions of various socialist countries limiting for economic pseudo-reasons the freedom of travel between the countries of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The newspaper said the decision clearly was directed at <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The rules about parcels and train service mention <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> specifically, it noted, and the number of visitors from all other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries together is less than half the number that come from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> annually. Polish <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Staniszewski </PERSON> and consular department officials declined to comment Monday. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> said it was taking the action to prevent goods on its domestic market from being bought out by visitors. Throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> many goods, ranging from tea, to school composition books to meat are running short because of the country's economic difficulties. Many Poles active as black-market traders are expert at finding goods in neighboring countries that can be bought cheaply and sold at home or elsewhere in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. Aside from traders, however, the restrictions will strike hard at Poles who visit friends and relatives on the Soviet side of the border. About 8 percent of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million population, or about 280,000 people, are ethnic Poles _ concentrated along the border, in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Salcininkai </LOCATION>, in southern <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. Last month the district of <LOCATION> Salcininkai </LOCATION>, where Poles are dominant, even declared it wanted to be treated as an autonomous Polish region. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> were allied from the 14th century on through the Jagiellonian dynasty, and then formed a joint commonwealth from 1569 until 1795 when <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and most of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> succumbed to Russian rule. Over the centuries, the gentry in Lithuanian became Polish-speaking while the peasantry spoke Lithuanian, the country's native Baltic language But in the late 19th century, a Lithuanian nationalist movement emerged aimed at fighting Polish cultural and <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> political domination. For most of the period between the world wars, the newly independent Polish and <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> states were at war or in a tense truce because of conflicting territorial claims. But in September 1939, both <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> were occupied by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> regained statehood within the Soviet orbit after World War II, but <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> remained a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> republic after having been incorporated into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940. In the past year, the Solidarity movement in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the Sajudis movement in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> have expressed support for one another in their parallel efforts to increase independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The border restrictions are `` clear proof that politicians linked to Solidarity were wrong'' to support Sajudis rather than the pro-Polish Union of Poles in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sztandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlodych </PERSON> said.

 A flotilla of ferries and extra trains helped keep rain-soaked traffic moving today, but only at a bumper-to-bumper pace. Rescuers halted the search for survivors at an earthquake-flattened freeway when the rubble became too unstable. And hospital officials said today survivor Buck Helm had improved and they were considering upgrading his condition from critical to very serious. Doctors said he was no longer in pain, and they were hopeful the longshoreman pulled from the freeway rubble would not have permanent kidney problems. `` In the next 24 to 48 hours, if he continues the way he is now, he will be out of the woods,'' Dr. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Huen </PERSON> said. The death toll rose to 61 today with the recovery of two more bodies in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the coronor's office said. A female body was found in the remains of a <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district fire, and a 68-year-old woman died of injuries suffered from the quake near downtown. Dozens remained missing and thousands were injured and homeless. At the Interstate 880 disaster in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, where 38 bodies have been recovered, officials said today crews began dismantling a 100-yard section of the double-deck freeway that was near collapse. `` It is a dangerous operation,'' said <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began putting together a $ 3 billion-plus package of federal disaster, but put off until later how to come up with the money to pay for it. `` There is an urgent need for help for people now,'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on transporation and resources <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> warnings were posted early today, rain was heavy in some areas and one ferry was turned back because of rough waters on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, authorities said. The Union Ferry Building, the terminus of all ferries when they reach <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, was closed for an hour because of high waves and the boats were diverted to a pier about a mile away. But most made it to work without major problem, despite predictions of commuter gridlock on the first full workday since the earthquke closed crucial freeways and broke a section of the vital <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> linking <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>. `` Considering everything, my commute has really gone smooth,'' said <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, who rode a ferry across the choppy bay to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Highway 101 was a sea of lights starting shortly after 5 a.m. PDT and the Golden Gate Bridge was bumper-to-bumper but moving. Bay Area Rapid Transit, which runs trains underneath the bay, had carried 70,000 passengers by 8:30 a.m., more than double the normal load. Damage estimates from Tuesday's earthquake topped $ 7 billion, eclipsing Hurricane Hugo as the costliest natural disaster in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. On Sunday, 150 residents of a housing project just 10 feet from collapsed I-880 joined thousands of homeless because of fears that more of the highway could fall. The unstable ruins forced authorities to halt rescue work late Sunday. `` We know there are more victims, more cars. But we do n't know how many,'' said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol Capt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Garver </PERSON>, speaking about I-880. There was no estimate of when work could resume. `` It's kind of minute by minute,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. The first phase of the Bay Bridge repair started when workers sawed a 50-foot collapsed section in half and lowered both halves 200 feet by crane Sunday to a barge on wind-whipped <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Without the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, 65,000 rush-hour motorists were forced to seek other ways to work. Daily, 260,000 cars use the bridge, the most crucial of the region's earthquake-disrupted roadways. Repairs will take at least four weeks. `` You just ca n't squeeze all the traffic onto other bridges. There just is n't enough room,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Markowitz </PERSON>, a traffic planner with the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're going to have a crisis until people adapt a little. Traffic planners took extraordinary precautions to avoid rush-hour paralysis on the first full workday since the earthquake. Commuters were urged to take public transportation, buddy up in carpools and come in earlier or later than normal. Fourteen ferries were added to ease the bridge crisis, and extra police and tow trucks were placedin choke zones in case something goes wrong. About 3 million people commute on a typical workday in the nine-county region. Authorities warned that 2 million of them could be disrupted in a nightmarish obstacle course. <ORGANIZATION> MTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Diridon </PERSON> said any motorist driving alone would be `` doing an anti-social act.'' Extra subway trains and ferries can accommodate an additional 45,000 riders. Other bridges must handle the rest of the traffic that normally crosses the 8.5-mile-long <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. Other freeways also are devastated. A 1 \ - mile section of I-880 is flattened, and the Embarcadero Freeway and the I-280 extension Farther south, landslide-clogged Highway 17 is open only to buses and emergency vehicles. The hospital where Helm was taken was deluged with flowers, telegrams and phone calls for a survivor who had been given up for dead. Helm, 57, regained some functions in his kidneys, which were damaged by dehydration during his 89-hour ordeal. He was also breathing better, but he was still having trouble moving his leg and was being fed by a tube in intensive care, said officials at <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s Highland General Hospital. Highway engineer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON>, the hero who found Helm, said he was checking the ruins for stability when he spotted the back of <PERSON> Helm </PERSON>'s head and a slight movement in his flashlight's beam. `` It stopped my heart,'' said <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON>, 29, who works for the state transportation department. In six subsequent sweeps of the section, sniffing dogs and sensitive listening devices failed to detect any more survivors. Rescuers were clearly buoyed at finding someone alive after four grisly days of removing bodies and crushed cars from the crumpled concrete. They placed giant airbags, hydraulic jacks and wooden timbers under concrete slabs and trucked in dirt to firm the foundation. They also installed seismic monitors on the structure. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday reported major cracks in three dams within five miles of the epicenter in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, but said they posed `` no public threat at this time'' because water is low behind them. A half-dozen tent cities have sprouted in <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, a city of 30,000 about 80 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Many residents were so frightened by the quake and its aftershocks that they refuse to go indoors, even if their homes have been declared safe. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> even opened a full-blown shelter of olive-green military tents, complete with medical and feeding facilities, in the battered community. Resumption of the World Series, the first ever between the two <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area teams, was pushed back until Friday. It had been hoped play would resume three days earlier. Football was played Sunday, but not in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The 49ers beat the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriots </ORGANIZATION> 37-20 in a game moved from Candlestick Park to <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and a collection was taken among the 75,000 fans for earthquake victims. A moment of silence honored the dead. Throughout the region, Sunday was a time for mourning the dead and giving thanks for survival. `` We pray to be spared from further suffering,'' Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> told 700 worshipers at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` I pray for the relief of suffering and anxiety. I can not forget to pray for the dead and the bereaved.'' In <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, parishioners of the St. Francis de Sales Cathedral held services in a Baptist church because their tower had been cracked and leaned precariously. `` Sometimes in life, God shakes us and says, ` Pay attention, there is something more important than the ordinary things in our lives,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said.

 Rightist extremists won six <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> city council seats and garnered more than 10 percent of the vote in several other municipal elections in the southern state of <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION>, officials said Monday. The successes in Sunday's balloting, at the cost of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, were the latest in a series of strong showings by the party led by former Nazi Waffen SS soldier <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON> said the Republicans will make an all-out effort to win seats in the federal Parliament in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> in national elections in December 1990. `` I am convinced that the party will be represented with at least 10 percent of the vote,'' <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. However, several public opinion polls have indicated the Republicans may not reach the 5 percent hurdle needed to gain any parliamentary seats in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. The Republicans have run on a platform of law-and-order, want to slash the number of foreign workers to combat unemployment running at about 9 percent, and have blamed established parties for a growing housing shortage. Leftist protesters demonstrated Sunday night in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> and stormed city hall in <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION>, where the Republicans won 6.9 percent of the vote to gain about four out of the 60 city council seats. No arrests or injuries were reported. The Republicans already have 11 of the 138 seats in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> legislature, as well as seats in city councils in major cities such as <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dortmund </ORGANIZATION> and in parts of <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION> state. Under <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s complicated election laws, the Republicans in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> will send two non-voting members to the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> after the 1990 elections, based on the results in the western part of the divided city. Their 7.1 percent of the vote in June gave the Republicans six seats in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and made them eligible for federal campaign funds from <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. An angry Mayor <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rommel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> vowed that he and his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> will have nothing to do with the Republicans in city hall. `` The Republicans wo n't improve anything. They will just make politics more difficult,'' <PERSON> Rommel </PERSON> said after the polls had closed. Officials initially had said that the Republicans' 9.6 percent of the vote would give the party five of the 60 city council seats, but late Monday said the number would be six under a complicated apportioning system. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' share of the vote <ORGANIZATION> Stuttgart </ORGANIZATION> fell from 38.8 percent to 33.1 percent, although <PERSON> Rommel </PERSON> will remain head of the local government. Republican candidates did even better in other key cities in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s richest state, including 10.6 percent in <LOCATION> Heilbronn </LOCATION>, 11.9 percent in <LOCATION> Pforzheim </LOCATION> and 14.2 percent in <LOCATION> Heidenheim </LOCATION>. The party even picked up a seat on the city council in the traditional leftist stronghold of <LOCATION> Freiburg </LOCATION>. It was the first time the Republicans had won seats in <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION>. The party, founded in 1983, was virtually unrepresented in the state's last municipal elections, held the following year. The results are expected to put further pressure on Chancellor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s party, which lost more than five percentage points of its share of the vote in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> and the state's other largest cities. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s party has been buffeted by ultra-conservatives calling for a tougher stance to win back voters from the Republicans, while the left has accused the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> of already making too many concessions to the far right.

 Police and volunteers answered dozens of emergency calls Monday after a pay dispute involving ambulance drivers and attendants shut down most ambulance stations in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, officials said. Police helped a heart attack victim, women in labor and people who had suffered minor injuries, a <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard spokesman said. In all, more than 50 calls were answered. `` It looks like we're not really encountering too many difficulties and we're coping OK,'' he said. Police converted about 30 vans into temporary ambulances carrying stretchers, first-aid kits and oxygen, and staffed by officers trained in first aid. But the officers were not qualified to administer drugs intravenously or operate defibrillators used to stimulate the heart. Ambulance workers have refused to work overtime for the past five weeks and have rejected a 6.5 percent pay offer, demanding instead an 11.5 percent raise. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> ambulance workers with five years' seniority are paid $ 16,906 a year. The workers' unions said they were ready to answer emergency calls, but ambulance chiefs decided to suspend employees without pay when they refused to handle other routine duties. Suspended crews then staged sit-ins at their stations, said the unions' chief negotiator, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>. The pay dispute paralyzed 62 of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s 71 ambulance stations, officials said. `` I would implore the ambulance men and women in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that they have made their point and now is the time to go back to work,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> ambulance fleet.

 Dealers are continuing to sell all-terrain vehicles for use by children despite an agreement between the government and manufacturers to curtail such sales, a consumer group charged Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization affiliated with consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, said 54 percent of dealers surveyed told volunteers who called on the telephone that an adult-sized vehicle would be appropriate for use by children under age 16. In addition, 75 percent of the dealers responding said it would not be difficult for a 10-year-old to learn to ride an adult-sized ATV, the consumer advocacy organization said. `` Too many ATV dealers would rather make a buck than tell a customer that ATV's are death traps for children under 16,'' said <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, consumer program director for the organization. Ms. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said volunteers called 215 dealerships in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The volunteers represented themselves as potential customers, saying they were interested in buying an ATV for a child of 10. According to the survey, salespeople at <ORGANIZATION> Otho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Forestville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cycles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wheaton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, told the callers that some ATV's would be safe for a child of that age. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, general sales manager for <PERSON> Otho </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, said he knew of no such incident and added that it is the dealership's policy not to make such sales `` I have personally chased people away who wanted to buy one for somebody under age,'' he said. `` It is our policy here not sell to anyone under age.'' <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> added, however, `` The one that I know for sure that I turned away went to another dealer and bought one.'' <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> Seavey </PERSON>, sales manager for Sun Cycles, said, `` I have instructed our sales personnel to adhere to these guidelines. We have had some turnover in sales personnel. I do n't know who they spoke with on the phone, but we stick to it to the letter.'' In January 1988 five ATV manufacturers _ <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kawasaki </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Polaris </ORGANIZATION> _ agreed to ban sales of three-wheel ATVs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The ATV makers also agreed to restrict the sales of certain four-wheelers for use by children over 16 and adults. The agreement resulted from a suit by the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` When the consent decree was signed, many people thought the ATV problem had been solved,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. `` Now we know that ATV dealers are still misleading the public about the vehicles' dangers. Fifty-four percent of the dealers said they would sell large four-wheel ATVs for use by a 10-year-old, in violation of the agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said. Manufacturers are responsible for making dealers aware of the provisions of the agreement, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said. ATVs are motorized machines that can traverse rough, off-road terrain. They range in engine size from 50 to 500 cubic centimeters. Under the agreement, only ATVs smaller than 90cc are permitted for sale for children 12 to 16 years old. In 1988, about 40 percent of the ATV-related deaths and injuries reported to the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> involved children under 16. The commission has received 1,346 ATV death reports for 1982 through June 21, 1989. Thirty-six deaths involving the vehicles were reported this year, with 20 involving the four-wheel machines.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intends to meet with Nicaraguan opposition candidate <PERSON> Violetta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> during a summit in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> but does not plan to have talks with Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who also will be there, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, on Friday at the invitation of President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> to take part in a meeting marking 100 years of democracy in that Central American country. Leaders of about 18 countries are expected to participate in the summit. The talks, which conclude before noon Saturday, are to be held at a resort complex about five miles from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> will attend as president of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, while Ms. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> will be there as part of an observer delegation. She is the presidential candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in elections scheduled for Feb. 25. Following a policy he inherited from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is trying to drive <PERSON> Oretaga </PERSON> from office, arguing that he leads a Marxist government. On Saturday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed a $ 9 million aid package intended to help the opposition defeat the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government. While no meeting with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is planned, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> noted that that the Nicaraguan leader will be in the same room with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during two plenary sessions and again during dinner. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the summit `` may be a very unique opportunity for us and the other countries of the hemisphere to impress on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> the importance of democracy and the folly of their ways.'' However, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role will be `` somewhat limited'' because he will not have any remarks or speeches related to the summit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to make departure remarks at nearby Andrews Air Force Base before dawn Friday as he heads for <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. After the close of the summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is supposed to speak to employees at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president probably will meet outside the summit with some of the leaders. Because the theme of the summit is democracy, the leaders of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> were not invited. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` did not dictate or comment on the guest list.''

<HEAD>House Approves Tighter Restrictions on Foreign Weapons Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted Monday to tighten restrictions on weapons sales to countries that support terrorism, approving legislation that was spawned by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's arms-for-hostages deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> The bill, expected to be approved later by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would strengthen the current ban on arms sales to countries officially designated as repeatedly supporting international terrorist acts. That list now includes <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. Both government and private sales are affected. The measure was approved by a voice vote. It also would put tighter controls on the president's ability to waive the prohibitions, requiring that the ban be lifted only if national security requires it, and then only after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is notified. Current law controlling arms sales abroad is `` sloppy and confusing,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who sponsored the bill in an effort to eliminate the loopholes that allowed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sale of missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1986 The measure imposes new penalties on violators and requires more detailed reporting of arms exports, including authority for transfers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons from the initial purchaser to a third country. It is similar to legislation passed last year by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but which died in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said the measure has been endorsed by the White House this time around, and is now more likely to receive <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval.

<TEXT>
 Leaders of upper crust <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> say The Limited clothing stores would attract the wrong element and should remain limited to shopping malls and other less ritzy venues. But a landlord who wants to rent to the chain on exclusive Worth Avenue _ an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> equivalent of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>' Rodeo Drive _ is crying snobbery and will seek to overturn the ban in <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> beginning this week. The <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection was `` arbitrary and capricious,'' according to <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Burman </PERSON>, attorney for landlord <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Handelsman </PERSON>. Several residents earned applause for speaking against The Limited at a council meeting in March 1988. `` I've been in their other shops, and it's nothing you ca n't buy in a mall,'' resident <PERSON> Elise </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON> complained at a council meeting in March 1988. `` It's not very dignified.'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> complained that the shops `` sell very inexpensive clothes; they are always on sale.'' She said when another chain store moved to <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, merchants `` were all extremely upset with the type of merchandise that they were carrying, plus the type of people they would attract.'' <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON> and other residents were not swayed by the assurances of a spokesman for The Limited who told them `` <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, Meryl Streep and Mrs. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, to name a few, have shopped in our Madison Avenue store'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. According to town ordinances drafted in 1980, large retail stores must prove the majority of their customers do not come from `` off-island locations,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVault </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> lawyer representing the town. <PERSON> Handelsman </PERSON>'s attorney countered that the landlord is not subject to the standard because the site was in use as a restaurant before the ordinance was enacted and is `` grandfathered in.'' <PERSON> Handelsman </PERSON> bought the site for $ 3.2 million in July 1983. The landlord's attorney also said the town fails to define methods on how to prove the customer base for a proposed store.

<HEAD>Iran Links Hostage Release to Missing Iranians, Frozen Assets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> on Monday offered help in getting Western hostages freed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> releases billions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets or helps settle the cases of three kidnapped Iranians. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said hostage-taking is an `` inhuman action'' hat can produce no positive political results. Eighteen Westerners, including eight Americans, are believed to be held by pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said his government was maintaining indirect contacts with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, his offer and demands were not new. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s comments did not change the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position `` We do not link the Iranian assets to the hostages and we do not make deals for hostages,'' he said. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> spoke at a three-hour news conference attended by about 50 foreign media representatives issued visas specifically for the event. Sitting behind a small table in the high-ceilinged hall of the presidential office in downtown <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> spoke in a soft voice, smiling frequently as he played with a string of worry beads. Responding to a question from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reporter, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said he had proposed `` two methods'' that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could use to facilitate release of the hostages: `` The first is that as a sign of goodwill, you release our assets. This is something that you will have to do, and sooner or later you will be forced to do it. So do it now. `` Secondly, if you do not want to give us our money, at least you can get your agents, your lackeys in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to release our hostages. If you say they are not alive, at least you can give us back their bodies or show us their graves.'' The assets, estimated at at between $ 9 billion and $ 12 billion, have been frozen since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> was seized by students in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in November 1979, nine months after the Islamic revolution seized power, overthrowing the pro-Western monarchy. Christian Lebanese Forces militiamen kidnapped the three Iranians in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in July 1982. The missing are <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Motevaselian </PERSON>, commander of the contingent of Iranian Revolutionary Guards based in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>; Iranian Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Kazem </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhavan </PERSON>, a correspondent for the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Their Lebanese Shiite driver, <PERSON> Rastegar </PERSON> <PERSON> Moqadam </PERSON>, who also held an Iranian passport, was grabbed with them at at a Lebanese Forces checkpoint 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. All four are believed dead. Lebanese Forces commander <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> said in August 1988 that after he took over the militia in 1986 he found no trace of the missing men and blamed his predecessor, <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobeika </PERSON>, for their disappearance and apparent murder. <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>'s disclosure was the first formal comment by the Lebanese Forces that it had been involved in the seizure of the missing Iranians. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> earlier had argued that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was keeping the issue of the American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> alive `` mainly as a bridge in order to approach us and establish relations with the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and this is a mistake.'' At one point during the news conference, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said: `` The thing is that your governments are not as much interested as you foreign journalists are in the question of hostages. You'd better make your governments interested in the matter.'' In addition to the Americans, the hostages are four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian. Held longest is <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Speaking through an interpreter, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> made contradictory statements on the hostage issue. Though at one stage he said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could assist in the release of the hostages, he later declared that `` we do not want to become involved in this issue'' and denied that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could exert any influence on the captors. He admitted <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has close relations with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, widely believed to be behind the hostage taking. But he maintained that the kidnappers were outside <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Asked about prospects of improving relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he said there had been no direct contacts between the two governments since a secret visit by former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> in 1986. Three American hostages were released between November 1985 and September 1986. In return, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> secretly received weapons and spare parts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` But there have been indirect contacts,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. `` We have received messages through two neighboring countries from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He did not identify the countries. `` In these messages they told us they have no ill-will toward us and want to solve the problem with us,'' he said. `` But we still have no confidence in what they say. We ask for signs and indications of goodwill on their part.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said these views had been relayed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through the unspecified neighboring countries. He ruled out any participation by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s post-war reconstruction, saying: `` I do n't think American companies can play any role in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Solidarity May Get Mayor's Job in Poland's Second-Largest City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Solidarity could gain control of city hall in <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, following a meeting Monday in which local officials agreed to leave the choice up to Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. A meeting by representatives of Solidarity, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and other political groups decided after a lengthy discussion that `` the mayoral crisis ... is ripe for a decision by the prime minister,'' the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. Organizer <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabski </PERSON> said some names were discussed at the meeting that he could not reveal. Based on the discussion, he said he was optimistic the matter would be settled soon. The appointment would end a nearly five-month impasse over the selection of mayor of <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>. It could also mark Solidarity's first victory in taking control of provincial and municipal governments from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Solidarity already has assumed leadership of the national government after the election of Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> as prime minister Aug. 24, and fully democratic elections for local governing councils are being planned for sometime next year. With communist power on the wane in the central government and in government-owned enterprises, provincial and municipal governments remain the last bastion of communist power. The post of mayor for the city of 850,000 people has been vacant since May 29, when the previous communist city president was ousted in a no-confidence vote following complaints of poor administration. An Oct. 11 attempt to elect a mayor failed when the communist-dominated city council refused to approve either of the two rival Solidarity-linked candidates approved by <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> earlier had declined to nominate either of two candidates proposed for the post by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Grabski </PERSON> said he could not guarantee the council would not reject <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s nominee again, but he said a consensus emerged during Monday's discussion to give <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> `` full trust'' in his decision. In the past, all provincial and municipal governments were under the central government and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Under reforms being prepared by Solidarity and the <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> government, local governments would be elected in fully democratic voting by their communities and they in turn would choose mayors and other local officers independent of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lawmakers today asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for an initial $ 3.8 billion package of federal aid for the earthquake-ravaged <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, while the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration proposed up to $ 2.5 billion in relief. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> arranged a late-afternoon meeting on a bipartisan package put together by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 47-member congressional delegation, with action by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> scheduled Tuesday White House aides and committee leaders worked in advance of the session to try to reach a compromise on the aid figure. `` Our current estimate is that the total federal contribution will probably have to be a little over $ 2.4 billion,'' White House Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said upon emerging from a meeting with Rep. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, D-Miss., chairman of the appropriations committee `` That's obviously subject to refinement,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said, adding the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> wants to avoid the `` kind of situation where you have a bidding war and then a veto threat.'' Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said the Californians' package included $ 1.1 billion of direct aid through the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> for a wide variety of relief programs and $ 1 billion for rebuilding highways and bridges Another $ 1.2 billion in disaster loans would be provided through the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for rebuilding damaged homes and businesses. The bill also includes $ 100 million in loan guarantees for public and private companies in low-income areas and $ 400 million in discretionary spending. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would determine how the discretionary money is spent. In an indication that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration may not be far apart, <PERSON> Darmon </PERSON> said his figure did not include `` raising the ceiling on the ability of the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to issue loans.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said up to $ 1 billion could be taken from existing programs, including $ 250 million of unspent money authorized for aiding victims of Hurricane Hugo. He said the adminstration was abandoning an effort to assemble its own relief package and would work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in fashioning one because of the shortness of time involved. `` It sounds to me they are trying to set a parameter to cut a deal,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proposal. `` Ultimately I think we will resolve a final number between the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, R-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, described the administration's $ 2.5 billion figure as an early number reached before the damage estimates escalated over the weekend `` It's my feeling the $ 2.5 billion, in the mind's eye of the administration, has already been raised,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, whose district south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> suffered severe damage in last Tuesday's earthquake, said the aid package still could become a vehicle for raising gasoline taxes or other levies. But he acknowledged the prospects for that are uncertain. `` The bottom line is that we are going to need to develop more resources,'' he said. `` If not, you're looking at this basically feeding into the deficit. I do n't like that approach, but our first priority is to help the victims of this kind of disaster.'' `` There is an urgent need for help for people now,'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on transportation and natural resources `` <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> is stretched very thin.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last Friday declined on several occasions to say whether he would consider breaking his `` no new taxes'' pledge to help pay for disaster relief, saying only that the government would do what it had to do. However, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today that, `` We do not intend to raise taxes'' to deal with the earthquake aftermath. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> viewed the human agony and the physical destruction associated with this disaster'' when he toured the area on Friday, the spokesman said. `` He is committed to providing all the federal help that is possible'' short of proposing a tax increase, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the administration, as in the congressional plan, would propose tapping the $ 12 billion federal Highway Trust Fund to help <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> rebuild highways and bridges damaged in last Tuesday's quake.

In addition to the amount of aid to be determined, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must also decide how to raise the funds. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sidestepped questions Friday about whether he would support a tax increase to finance the package. Some lawmakers have proposed an exemption in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting law to accommodate the aid needed.

<TEXT>
 British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> battled the rest of 49-nation <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, the former British Empire, over <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> at this week's summit meeting. But this time, the others had had enough. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> accused Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of ignoring a cherished British tradition, `` fair play,'' when she issued a dissenting statement against plans by the 49-nation <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> to pressure <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on reform. `` The price of <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> membership is loyalty,'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> told her as the presidents and prime ministers of ex-colonies gathered round the conference table in closed session Monday, the second-last day of the weeklong summit. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said: `` This is not the way business should be done.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> responded that she was `` astounded and utterly appalled'' at the attacks and owed the other leaders `` no explanation whatsoever.' The anger provoked by what was a matter of procedure, not substance, reflected the deep frustration in the largely Third World organization over what its sees as Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s constant obstruction of the fight against apartheid. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> left the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> in 1961 under threat of being thrown out because of its apartheid policy, which denies the black majority the vote. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a major South African trading partner, argues sanctions hurt the black majority and increase white resistance to change. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s deeply hostile black southern African neighbors, mostly <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> members, also continue trading because they depend economically on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has refused to impose most of a list of 11 non-binding <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> embargoes against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including bans on air links, new investment, and imports of agricultural products, iron, steel, coal and urnanium. It was drawn up in 1986 after <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, the other white founding members joined the effort. The new <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> declaration was drafted by 10 foreign ministers after 17 hours of tough negotiations. British Foreign Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON> argued that moves toward reform by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s new president, F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, made sanctions especially inappropriate now. Everyone compromised a bit _ the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> agreed that current embargoes should not be lifted and African nations held off demands for new trade sanctions. The final document called for tighter financial pressure, but that other sanctions would be considered only if the white-led government fails to take measures dismantling apartheid in the next six months. The declaration incorporated an Australian proposal that the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> call on international banks to restrict South African trade credits to a maximum of 90 days and urge governments to make it more difficult for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to get credits. They all signed on Sunday, with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> personally proposing its adoption. She did n't mention that within an hour she'd be releasing a five-page statement setting out her objections to sanctions and crediting the South African government with `` important and positive changes.'' It was this tactic that angered <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, the main authors of the report. `` Where would we be if 49 countries did this?'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said, speaking to reporters. `` You sign a deal at 5 o'clock and repudiate it at six ... -LRB- saying -RRB- by the way, what I signed really does n't reflect all my views. `` I think it's despicable,'' said <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, whose country, however, is among those that has continued trading with neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` What turns out to be the majority view should bind us all _ that's how democratic systems work.'' On the environment, the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> issued a declaration Saturday calling for assurances that poor countries are not blamed for problems beyond their control nor shortchanged in the fight against global pollution. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> said industrialized countries in the West cause most pollution while poor countries are asked to stop cutting down trees and take other measures to protect the environment. `` The deserts of the world can be made to bloom if the rich countries are prepared to spend money to draw up underground water and plant trees instead of just building golf courses'' in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> deserts, he said, without elaborating. Referring to fears that pollution-caused global warming could melt polar ice and raise sea levels, <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Maumoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> said his <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island nation was willing to host the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> summit in the year 2050 but might have to do it underwater.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday called `` totally off-base'' the Iran-Contra prosecutor's contention that Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is using procedural delays to thwart the trial of a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s `` effort, as it has been all along is to protect the national security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> while allowing the trial to go forward. That's our bottom-line objective and we are trying to bring that about,'' said spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. `` I think the attorney general feels that those comments that were made in the court filing last week to be totally off-base,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said of the charge made in court pleadings by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. `` We are having discussions with a number of people on how best to resolve the case'' of former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. The spokesman refused to say whether the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was pressing the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and other intelligence agencies to release material the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> wants kept secret. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, asking a federal appeals court to lift a stay in <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>' trial, accused <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> of using `` unjustifiable delaying tactics'' designed `` to tie this case in a knot of endless litigation.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was much less emphatic when asked about <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s charge, saying: `` the court record speaks for itself. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Belcher </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, refused to comment. In his filing last week, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> asked the 4th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to rescind its order granting the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at least another month's delay to give <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s attorneys more time to ponder secrecy issues raised by the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case. At issue is a trial judge's order that the defense could disclose the locations of three <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> stations in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wants to block references to the locations during the trial even though they have been publicized. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> was merely trying to preserve a `` diplomatic fiction'' by refusing to allow references to the stations to be made in court. The appellate court ruled last month that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> could n't appeal the trial judge's order, saying <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> could exercise the politically distasteful option of filing an affidavit blocking release of the secrets. Such an affidavit would likely result in dismissal of the charges against <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, who is accused of lying to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and to a presidential commission about his role in helping set up an arms-supply network for the Nicaraguan rebels. In seeking a 30-day extension in the deadline on requesting an appeal of the <ORGANIZATION> 4th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling, the department said the solicitor general needed more time to decide whether to seek a rehearing of the case.

<HEAD>Refugees Say Government Holding Up Return</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Advocates for people displaced by the civil war accused the government Monday of holding up the return of 1,300 refugees suffering illness and exposure because of the delay. The National Resettlement Coordinator and members of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> churchworkers' delegation called on the rightist administration of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> to remove all obstacles to the refugees' return. The government says it has nothing against the refugees' return but that they must be documented in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> officials before coming back. The Resettlement Coordinator accused the government `` of prolonging the documentation process'' to delay the refugees' return. About 13,000 Salvadorans live in three refugee camps across the northern border in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Most fled to the camps in the early 1980s because of heavy fighting between leftist rebels and government forces in the northern sector of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. More than 7,000 refugees have returned since 1987 to rebuild their lives in the north, still a combat zone in the 10-year-old civil war. The U.S.-backed government considers the returned refugees sympathizers and collaborators of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the rebel army. About 1,300 refugees from the <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> camp had planned to return Oct. 17. The return was to have been coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for Refugees. Col. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> said Saturday the documentation has begun in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> and that as soon as it is finished, the refugees will be allowed to return. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> commission said it can not provide transportation and other logistics for return without government approval. The Resettlement Coordinator's allegation of government delays was seconded by a delegation of 30 American churchpeople who traveled to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> this month to accompany the returnees. The Rev. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilcote </PERSON>, a Presbyterian pastor from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said three people have died in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> from exposure since the refugees dismantled their shacks last week in anticipation of departure. She also said an epidemic of Dengue fever has afflicted many refugees. About 300 refugees accompanied by Salvadoran and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> churchworkers left <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> by foot last week for the border. They reached <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocotepeque </LOCATION>, where they remain in precarious conditions in a church awaiting documentation, the refugee advocates said.

<HEAD>USDA Says Farmers Won't Have Disaster Checks Cut For Some Second
Crops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers who rotated their traditional spring crop to land where winter wheat was destroyed by drought or freezing weather are entitled to disaster payments for their losses, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, called the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> good news for some farmers, but said it does not go far enough in reversing <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> regulations that would cut disaster assistance to many other farmers who had also planted a second crop after the drought. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aide said the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision Monday apparently applies to only winter wheat farmers who would traditionally plant a second crop, such as milo, on non-wheat acres in the spring. Those farmers who planted their second crop on the wheat acres instead, to take advantage of fertilizer already on the land, will not see their disaster checks cut, the aide said. Monday's decision does not cover cotton farmers who also planted a second crop, or farmers who planted non-traditional second crops on their wheat acreage, officials said. `` I am still unhappy that people who did not plant a second crop, who waited for the government to help, are in some cases better off than the people who planted a second crop,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. Farm state lawmakers contend <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s formula for calculating disaster payments under an $ 895 million relief program for farmers hurt by this year's severe weather was unfair to producers who planted a second crop. Legislators and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> have been wrangling over the regulations on `` ghost acres'' for two months and one <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aide said Monday's decision came because `` we hand to force their hand on this. According to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, some farmers in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and elsewhere on the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> planted milo or cotton on their failed wheat acres this year. `` The acres that would have been planted to the spring crop were often left fallow, with the intention of planting this fall's wheat crop there,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` Such a rotation allows the spring crop to use the fertilizer and water put down for the failed wheat crop, and it allows for the control of troublesome weeds, such as johnsongrass, on the fallowed land.'' But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said those farmers were told by <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> that their disaster checks would be reduced if they instead planted their spring cotton or milo crops on the winter wheat land. `` Had they planted the spring crop normally, without rotating it to the failed wheat acres, there would be no reduction in the disaster checks,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s initial plans were unfair and went against <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' intentions when it passed the disaster relief package. `` It is obviously unfair to penalize farmers when they are following normal farming practices by simply rotating their crops on the farm,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said.

 A court on Monday convicted two Basque separatists for murder in a 1987 car bombing at a <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> supermarket that killed 21 people and seriously injured 44 in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s bloodiest terrorist attack. The court sentenced the man and woman, both members of the Basque separatist organization <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, to a total of 1,588 years in prison for murder and wrongful injury. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> terrorists have been waging a campaign for independence for three predominantly Basque provinces in northern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> since 1968 and they have been blamed for thousands of deaths in assassinations and bombings. The June 19, 1987, bombing in the garage of the Hipercor supermarket in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> was their deadliest attack. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> stands for Basque Homeland and <LOCATION> Libery </LOCATION> in the Basque language. Four <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> members were indicted in the <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> bombing but only the two were tried.

 Boarding one of the first ferryboats pressed into emergency service Monday to carry commuters across <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, I expected a romantic ride through the fog. Reality brought nausea. The worst storm of the season struck just an hour before tens of thousands of residents in <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> counties east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> began the trek to work. This 127-foot ocean vessel, one of 14 being run on routes unused by ferries for decades, met blustery winds, giant swells that crashed across the bow and waves that sent it constantly lurching from side to side. The song of the journey should be, `` I Left My Stomach on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>.'' The 55-minute voyage, made necessary because of the collapse of a 50-foot section of the vital <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> during last Tuesday's quake, was twice what was expected. The triple-deck monohull pulled away from the dock 40 minutes late because of weather worries and a low passenger count. The captain announced some boats might be turned back. A big groan. I arrived dockside before dawn, naively thinking I could relive idyllic bay crossings created by writers like <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> and in such classic movies as <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>'s `` Dark Passage.'' I was n't alone. `` I've just been through hell, but heck, I have to admit I made it through it; it can only get better, this ca n't get much worse,'' said an ashen-faced <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Trowbridge </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, who came onto the deck to alleviate sea sickness. I moved up to the bow, where a giant swell drenched me. Since I was downwind, I figured it would be best to remain there in case I lost my breakfast. The ferry, with a capacity of 700 people and carrying 338, was supposed to dock at the Union Ferry Building in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. But waves craching there forced the boats to divert to Fisherman's Wharf Altogether my commute _ from hearth to work station _ took 3 -LCB- hours. I used to do it in 45 minutes. At the wharf, I tried to catch a cable car into downtown, only to find it shut down. I walked another seven blocks in the drenching rain and caught a city bus to work. Roughing it across the bay did n't dampen everybody's spirits. `` Considering everything, my commute has really gone smooth,'' said <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, 42, of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, used to work on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, ferries, and was unflappable. `` Everybody's just going to have to go into slow motion,'' she said. `` That includes all the bosses.'' <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierini </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, recalled taking ferries to <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> as a child. She relived those memories Monday morning. `` This makes up for all the bad things that came out of the earthquake,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> research nurse. The weather was trying for <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Crowley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION>, which operated the ferries. He rode the <ORGANIZATION> Catalina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Empress </ORGANIZATION>, which normally operates between <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` Mother nature is testing our mental state; normally this bay is as smooth as glass at this time,'' said <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>. About 3,000 people used the ferries Monday morning, <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON> said. The bay's ferryboat industry to the East bay, which began in 1863, grew to include hundreds of boats at its height in the early 1930s. It was discontinued shortly after the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> bridge opened in 1937.

<HEAD>Official Worries that Salt Dome May Be Leaking Radiation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAXTERVILLE, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An underground cavity in a salt dome where two nuclear weapons were tested in the 1960s may be leaking radioactive materials, state officials say. At least one federal official says there is no problem. `` I think a study should be done to answer questions we still have about whether there are cracks in the dome and whether it's leaking,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinson </PERSON>, who helped the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> conduct what he calls an inconclusive 1979-1980 study at the site <PERSON> Pinson </PERSON>, a nuclear chemist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Hattiesburg </LOCATION>, said the study of the Tatum Salt Dome left many unanswered questions about activities at the test site. Another underground salt formation, near <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, is the site of the federal government's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a complex of chambers intended for permanent storage of military radioactive waste. The WIPP was supposed to open last October, but questions about the long-term safety of the salt bed and transportation of waste to the site have delayed the opening. Tests near the Tatum dome show tritium levels are increasing in overflow ponds when they should be decreasing, he said. Some scientists fear the formation of solid salt may be cracked, allowing potentially hazardous radioactive isotopes such as tritium to escape from the cavity formed by the explosions a half-mile beneath <LOCATION> Lamar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1964 and 1966. Another theory is that the salt is squeezing together, forcing radioactive brine from within the dome up toward the surface, <PERSON> Pinson </PERSON> said. Test samples taken by the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> have found relatively high levels of tritium at the surface above the salt dome during the dry season. These levels diminish as the wet season encroaches and water runs off into swollen creeks and overflow ponds near ground zero. Since the levels of tritium appear to be restored each year, some experts theorize a leak in the dome continually replenishes the isotope in soil near the surface. Federal guidelines for safe drinking water limit tritium to 20,000 picocuries per liter. A picocurie is a measure of the rate at which atoms disintegrate radioactively. Tritium has been found at levels as high as 1 million picocuries per liter in mud around ground zero, the point directly above the blast chamber, records show. `` Obviously there's a pretty good source of tritium down there at the site,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON>, manager of the state Energy Plan Development. `` And we've been asking ourselves for a decade ... where it's coming from. Whether it's leaking? Of course that's something we wonder. The dome is free of leaks, said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, nuclear radiation advisor to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's a pretty good salt dome,'' he said. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> tests have not found hazardous levels of tritium. Of the seasonal cycle of tritium, he said: `` We do n't consider that to be a problem.'' The pattern of tritium found in shallow test holes several yards from ground zero is also difficult to explain, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a health physicist for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>'s Radiological Health Division. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said tests taken the farthest from ground zero should reflect the lowest levels of tritium. But he found tritium levels decrease in tests of shallow wells along the periphery of the dome site, then increase in wells farther away. `` We would not expect this activity to show up,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said, `` and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> is in fact trying to evaluate why we are seeing these levels so far from ground zero.'' Two non-nuclear natural gas explosions detonated inside the dome on Feb. 2, 1969, and April 19, 1970, may have released `` some radioactivity formerly trapped in recrystallized salt on the walls and floors of the nuclear cavity,'' a 1978 DOE report says.

<HEAD>Miners Threaten Resumption of Strikes in Two Coal Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Miners are threatening to resume strikes in two coal basins where walkouts this summer brought much of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s coal industry to a standstill, the news media reported Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, reported that in the western Siberian town of <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> about 20,000 miners and transport workers participated in a two-hour warning strike Monday morning. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said in the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> workers stopped loading coal at one mine and workers at 12 other mines are planning walkouts beginning Wednesday. Reports said the miners claim the government has failed to fulfill promises it made in order to end the summer's strikes that involved hundreds of thousands of miners in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, the far north and central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The Mezhdurechensk strike and planned stoppages in <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> violate a new strike law passed this month by the Soviet parliament. The law requires unions to submit disputes to arbitration before calling a strike and prohibits walkouts in such vital industries as transport, energy and defense. Local leaders in <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION>, 1,550 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, accused the strikers of showing disrespect for the new law, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. But it reported a strike committee member, <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shikharev </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> the strike was only a warning measure and would not harm the mine's output. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Shikharev </PERSON> as saying, `` July's strike was only temporarily stopped. We only renewed it because our demands are not being fulfilled.'' Among the concessions won during the summer strikes were government promises to improve supplies of consumer goods, provide better working conditions and grant the mines more financial independence. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said workers in <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> complained that officials were finding loopholes to avoid delivering some of the promised benefits. It said the workers sent telegrams to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and the main Soviet mining areas advising them of the planned strike. The newspaper also said several legislators were going to the mining areas to inform the miners that the government was doing its best to fulfill its promises. During the summer strikes, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a televised interview that he sympathized with the miners but the strikes could cause an economic disaster.

 Women nationwide were urged Monday to lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to salvage Medicare coverage of breast cancer tests from the catastrophic health insurance program the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> recently voted to repeal. `` If this were a man's issue, it would n't be a problem,'' <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said following a ceremony honoring people who have raised awareness about breast cancer, which strikes one in 10 American women. Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, was cited for her efforts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, such as including mammography tests in the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. Ms. <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, noting that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> recently voted to repeal the act, urged the 275 doctors, community leaders and others on hand to lobby <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to accept a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provision retaining coverage for breast cancer tests. She called on women across the country to join the lobbying effort. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators are trying to work out differences on the program. The mammography program would initially cost $ 60 million but would ultimately save millions more through early detection that would save hospitalization costs, Ms. <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON> said. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> allows mammograms to remain covered by the insurance program, then <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, as of Jan. 1, would pay for the tests every two years for women aged 65 and over. Women over age 35 who are eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> because of disability would also be covered for exams, either yearly or every two years depending on their risk. According to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, breast cancer will be diagnosed in 142,000 women this year and will cause 43,000 deaths. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> Bales </PERSON>, spokeswoman for National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, said 37 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women over age 40 have never had a mammogram, even though medical experts say breast cancer deaths could be reduced by one-third if all women over 40 had regular mammograms.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> called Monday for a new military relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to sharply reduce the `` first strike'' nuclear weapons that could be devastating in a surprise attack. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in his first major arms-control speech, also urged a reluctant <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve White House requests for funds to produce mobile Midgetman missiles. Otherwise, he said, the Soviets could exploit differences between <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` United we stand; divided we fall,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in a speech to the private <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Copies were distributed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s emphasis on reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet first-strike weapons, such as Soviet SS-18 intercontinental ballisic missiles, signals the strategy the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will pursue in trying to conclude a treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. There, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators began work in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to cut arsenals of strategic weapons _ ocean-spanning bombers, missiles and submarines _ by 30 percent to 50 percent. Critics, such as former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, have urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to put greater stress on slashing first-strike weapons instead of concentrating on across-the-board numerical reductions. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> made no reference to a 30 percent to 50 percent cutback in his speech. This did not suggest the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would abandon that goal in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks -LRB- START -RRB-, but his emphasis on curbing first-strike weapons indicated a more selective approach in negotiating reductions. Like the SS-18, designed to destroy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intercontinental ballistic missiles in their silos, first-strike nuclear weapons have the potential of wreaking havoc on the other side's nuclear forces. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded to the perceived threat by launching a program, known popularly as `` Star Wars,'' designed to destroy Soviet ballistic missiles in space before they could approach their targets. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in his speech, encouraged the Soviets to concentrate their efforts on defense, as well, while the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration pursues the Strategic Defense Initiative. He said in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiations the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would explore `` a cooperative and stable transition to a greater reliance on stability-enhancing, cost-effective strategic defense.'' In fact, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` we want to see Soviet defensive military operations made habitual.'' He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was emphasing in negotiations the relative merits of slow-flying weapons, such as cruise missiles and bombers, which are not suitable for a first strike. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal was `` a new relationship in which the capabilities and incentives to attack first are minimized and the possibilities of strategic defense are pursued.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> used the speech to publicly prod <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to drop its objections to the Midgetman, which is designed as a safeguard against a Soviet first-strike because of its mobility. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has eliminated the $ 100 million requested by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave its approval for the money. A conference committee is trying to resolve this and other differences over the $ 305 billion defense authorization bill. `` We will need to rely upon the deployment of mobile missiles as a key component of our nuclear modernization program,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Referring to the negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> added, `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needs now to support START, not undercut it, by funding this program.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> initially planned to speak to the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on arms control last Thursday. The earthquake caused the postponement. Answering questions later on other subjects, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reaffirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the reunification of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in a way in which East Germans `` will be integrated into a community of democratic European nations.'' He acknowledged, however, that the idea of joining the two Germanies together `` conjures up visions of a return to 1937 borders or perhaps a reunification that is not achieved in peace and freedom.'' On another subject, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that despite a sustained effort to arrange <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> negotiations, `` I do n't see it as anything more than a possibility.''

<HEAD>Communist-Linked Union, Party Challenge Solidarity Economic Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist labor leaders spoke out Monday against the Solidarity-led government's handling of the economy and a union movement linked to the party began a nationwide protest. The four <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ministers in the 24-member Cabinet approved the government economic program, but union and party officials have been increasing criticism of the government. A meeting in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> of 208 heads of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> committees from factories nationwide said, `` Working people are painfully feeling another drop in living standards. ... The country needs a government social policy that will respect the human right for a certain minimum'' living standard, the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> new agency reported. `` We are against the vision of rapacious capitalism which would be constructed by handing society's property over to foreign capital,'' the meeting declared, according to <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. That was a reference to still-sketchy plans to turn some state-run factories over to the private sector. The trade union movement OPZZ, allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, began a week-long protest action, placing banners and posters at in factories and offices. It also criticizes the economic reform plan of the Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, former Solidarity journalist. OPZZ, which now claims 6 million members, was created by Communist authorities in 1982 to supplant Solidarity after the independent union was banned. It claims the government is letting prices rise uncontrollably, slowing wage increases, and not doing enough to increase the supply of goods. `` We ca n't catch up with prices; the government must control them,'' said a poster in <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION>, and another said, `` High prices plus soup kitchens equals ever-growing poverty,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s government plans to fight inflation by halting subsidies to inefficient state industries and limiting the growth of credit and wages. Some factories have reacted by raising prices. In August, the cost of living rose 40-50 percent after the previous Communist governemnt removed controls on food prices.

 Several hundred employees of an East German factory have formed an independent union, a worker spokesman said Monday, stirring memories of Solidarity's challenge a decade ago to an equally stern Polish regime. In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, at least 100,000 people marched for democracy. Workers at the <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Pieck </PERSON> electronics factory in <LOCATION> Teltow </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, call their union Reform. It is the first independent labor union in this communist nation, as Solidarity was the first in the Soviet bloc, and includes the right to strike among its demands. There was no comment from the government. <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> quoted a Reform spokesman as saying workers in entire sections of the plant had resigned from the state <ORGANIZATION> Freie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gewerkschaftsbund </ORGANIZATION> labor federation. It said workers had appealed to comrades in other factories to spread the new union. A crowd estimated at 300,000 by supporters and `` over 100,000'' by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> marched through downtown <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> demanding a more democratic society. For the first time, a Roman Catholic church was made available to activists for the weekly demonstrations and rallies. Lutheran church sources said police did not interfere with the peaceful parade. More than 120,000 people filled the streets of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> a week ago to demand reform. Marchers carried placards reading `` Egon, who asked us?'' and `` We want dialogue, not lies.'' In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, 3,000 pro-democracy activists held a vigil in the <ORGANIZATION> Gethsemane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to support their comrades in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said about 40,000 people rallied in <LOCATION> Schwerin </LOCATION>, a northwestern city, in an event sponsore by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to encourage dialogue between citizens and the leadership. Pro-democracy spokesmen said there would be demonstrations Tuesday when the parliament elected <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> head of state. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, 52, took over Wednesday as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, replacing <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, his 77-year-old mentor. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, who led the nation for 18 years, was forced from power by growing unrest at home and the flight of tens of thousands of East Germans, most of them young, skilled workers, to freedom in the West. Official media have carried calls for reform since <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s departure, but opposition spokesmen remain skeptical about <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s willingness to implement the kind of broad change under way or comtemplated elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> Monday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> devoted four pages to discussions of reform `` going on all across the nation.'' `` Discussions start again'' and `` critical discussion are going on everywhere,'' it said in a commentary. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, officials said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> regime had agreed to let about 100 refugees at the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, join 2,000 East Germans going to the West from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. On Monday, a plane carrying 154 refugees left <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The number of East Germans arriving at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s embassies in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has continued to grow despite the first signs that some change may come to their homeland. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has accepted an invitation to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and meet with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and East German media suggested over the weekend that something might be learned from the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader's reforms. No date for the visit has been announced. On the independent union, the <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> government remained silent. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 8.6 million workers have been represented by the official federation, which is run by a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>. The party has said it will retain its `` leading role,'' even if reform comes, and that ngotiations with the opposition are unnecessary because the nation has enough official organizations for discussing reform. It appeared certain the government would try to prevent the independent union from gaining the mass support that eventually carried Solidarity to political power in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. A statement from union spokesman <PERSON> Roelf </PERSON> <PERSON> Boerger </PERSON> said Reform's goals include the right to strike He urged all 6,000 employees of the <LOCATION> Pieck </LOCATION> factory, named for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s first president, to join. <PERSON> Boerger </PERSON> said the official federation represents <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> interests and `` does n't enjoy the confidence of the workers.'' `` Factories must become more independent and set prices and salaries themselves,'' he declared. `` In place of patronizing bureaucratic treatment and being led around like children, we need worker participation in the factories.'' His statement, distributed to Western news media in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, did not say when the union was founded. It said Reform supports <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new opposition political groups and favors complete restructuring of the economy.

 The house that high-performance plastics helped build was unveiled Monday, a gracious colonial dwelling with some decidedly 21st century, dream house technology tucked behind its facade. `` We are very excited in sharing with you what we feel the future of home ownership is,'' <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Wascher </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION>, said at the opening of the Living Environments Concept House at the division's headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> officials were quick to point out that the engineering plastics used in the house have little in common with the stuff of toys or with the highly futuristic, space-age type of plastic housing that has been experimented with over the past 40 years. About one-third of the light beige house is plastic. The total cost is estimated at $ 10 million, but that includes research and model development. The engineering plastics used typically have high melting points, create little smoke when they burn and have good sound-deadening properties. But the hime is so airtight it requires strong ventilating systems. The house has curved bay windows, generous decks and huge atrium windows in front and back. It is clearly in the dream house category, with such amenities as double showers that convert to steam rooms, power windows and movable walls. Tour guides showed off some of the features, such as a 50-gallon reservoir in the basement in case of drought, liquid quartz technology to make naked windows opaque and refrigeration systems set into the kitchen walls. Cutaway sections throughout the house showed the plastics molded into walls and floors and, in one bathroom, the tub was sliced in two, right down to a bisected rubber duck. GE officials say the house will serve as a laboratory to explore use of engineering polymers in construction markets, but also contains some practical concepts that are already in use. Roof tile panels of high-performance plastics are already on the market, as are some of the window units, which feature snap-in moldings. `` You get used to it. You do n't paint it, you just replace it,'' said tour guide <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillette </PERSON>. The 3,000-square-foot, two-story house, with a split-level basement, was built for a family of four, with a large master bedroom luxuriously appointed with a Jacuzzi, window seat and state-of-the-art Japanese toilets featuring a built-in exhaust fan and automatic bidet. Company officials conceded it will be some time before all of the innovations in the concept house become commonplace. `` We do n't think we can change the industry overnight,'' <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> said. The plastics used in the building are now two to 10 times more expensive than traditional building materials, but <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> expects them to become competitive as builders look toward prefabricated and component assembly to hold down costs. Eventually, the plastic construction, which may feature prefab wall panels complete wmth insulation and siding that snaps together, will provide a more efficient way of building, company officials said. More than 45,000 pounds of plastics are used in the house in such areas as the roof, windows, siding, plumbing, foundation and electrical and mechanical systems. But much of the visible material in the house is unabashedly traditionl, such as the maple floors, and company officials said that was intentional. `` We never intended to replace all wood, glass, stone and steel,'' <PERSON> Wascher </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` like all men now, he does n't like confrontation'' and seldom argues at home, first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a television interview broadcast Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, interviewed by entertainer <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, also said a role model is former first lady <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, that she seldom worries about security and that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is `` the most beautiful place in the world.'' Asked by <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> whether she and the president argued, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded: `` Not much, after 44 years'' of marriage. `` We sort of grew up together.'' `` He listens,'' she continued. `` He's like all men now, he does n't like confrontation. It's very hard to argue when only one fellow will argue.'' `` I'm feistier than <PERSON> George </PERSON>,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that she was `` the enforcer'' in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> household when their five children were growing up, disciplining them and even spanking them on occasion. `` I did n't spank hard, but I spanked,'' she said. `` I gave them enormous stablity -LRB- and -RRB- a lot of advice, none of which they took,'' she said. She said that listening to her children was tedious at times, `` mine were so boring, they wanted to tell you the whole movie.'' And, before selecting their present wives, her four sons sometimes brought girlfriends home who were `` real dogs,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I treated them like they were neat nice people.'' The first lady's press secretary, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, said the interview for the syndicated television show was taped two weeks earlier. Asked whom she most admired among other first ladies, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I think most often of Lady <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. I've known her for a number of years ... she lived a life very much like I lived.'' `` She said ... if you can help people by talking about your cause and making people aware of it, and if by chance it reflects well on your husband, that's what life is all about. I like that.'' She also praised <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> for being `` very courageous'' and called <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a `` very close friend. ... She really made the White House sparkle. She fixed the plumbing and the electricity. All those things you take for granted that I did n't have to do.'' `` And I kind of admired old Bess -LRB- <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> -RRB-. She did what she wanted.'' Asked about her concerns for the safety of her family, especially in light of recent alleged threats from Colombian drug lords, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` Why waste your time?'' `` I have a great belief in God and enormous belief in the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, in that order,'' she said.

 Right-wing extremists yelling that the Holocaust was a lie had a shouting match Monday with a concentration camp survivor outside an international conference on Nazi war crimes. `` You are Nazis! You are Nazi terrorists!'' shouted Rabbi <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gryn </PERSON>. `` You probably would have killed me.'' Experts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had to pass the 14 protesters who were waving <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> flags, shouting `` Six Million Lies!'' and passing out newspapers headlined `` Holocaust Story An Evil Hoax'' at the entrance to the Royal Westminster Hotel. For <PERSON> Gryn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synagogue </ORGANIZATION>, who was born 59 years ago in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and spent 1944-45 in the <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION> concentration camp, it was too much. `` I lost my temper,'' he said. `` They're really obscene and they're young, and the awful thing is, they would have put in the gas pellets. They're the haters. What breeds them?'' The clash highlighted some of the opposition to changing British law to allow prosecution of alleged Nazi war criminals living in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the theme of a conference called `` Time For Justice'' sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> All-Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliamentary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Sir <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hetherington </PERSON>, coauthor of a report recommending the prosecution of alleged war criminals, said there is enough evidence to prosecute three people living in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, whom he refused to identify. He said three other cases that had been investigated in detail needed further inquiries and another 75 cases should be investigated. He also appealed for information on 46 alleged war criminals whom his inquiry team had been unable to trace. `` I am quite unshaken on this, that having weighed all the pros and cons, we in this country ought to legislate to take the necessary jurisdictional powers,'' <PERSON> Hetherington </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Efriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuroff </PERSON> of the Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said he had turned over the name of one more alleged Nazi war criminal living in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to the British Home office on Monday. `` We're talking about a person who served in a unit which carried out the mass murder of thousands upon thousands of innocent men, women and children,'' he said in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television interview. He did not identify the person. Parliament is due to debate the war crimes report this autumn and vote on whether to introduce legislation enabling prosecutions to take place. Labor lawmaker <PERSON> Merlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rees </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Parliamentary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, predicted victory for those favoring prosecution would not be easy. `` I believe there will be those, particularly among the younger generation, perhaps among the older generation, too, who will say it is all 50 years ago,'' he said. Opening the conference on behalf of Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, Home Office Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> gave a hint of the government's position saying: `` It is his view and it is my view that we should certainly forgive, but we should certainly not forget. <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> led a string of condemnations of the flag-waving protesters, saying they were trying `` to clothe their own attempts to rewrite history in some form of public acceptance.'' He added: `` I think what they are doing outside is perfectly disgusting and I condemn it utterly in every way.'' One demonstrator, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON>, said they were all members of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a small white supremacist party. `` The gas chambers were lies produced by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to justify their activities in World War II,'' <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON> said. `` These -LRB- war crimes -RRB- trials are absolutely wicked. They are trials based on evidence of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, and who believes them?'' If <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approves legislation, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would be following the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in prosecuting war criminals. `` It truly is an issue which should have no territorial boundaries,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>, director of the Office of Special Investigation at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He said more than 1,200 people had been brought to the attention of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. Using existing laws on extradition and deportation, more than 30 war criminals had been kicked out, 35 others had been stripped of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship and 25 cases were in the courts, he said. <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> stressed the importance of prosecuting all Nazi war criminals, even the `` small fry.'' But he guessed that possibly 10,000 `` small fry'' Nazi criminals living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were getting away with their crimes because nobody knows who they are.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation Monday that expands the federal government's program to restore abandoned coal mines to a safe and environmentally acceptable condition. The bill, approved 281-63 but opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, extends through fiscal year 2007 the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s authority to collect fees on coal under the 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act But it also makes changes in how the money is used, reduces the fees in states that have completed all their abandoned mine reclamation projects and creates a fund for reclamation of abandoned non-coal mines. The legislation now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, who led the opposition to the bill, said House action was `` extremely premature'' because the 1977 act was not due to expire until 1992. He said he opposed the expansion of reclamation efforts to non-coal mine sites and said more time should be given to get reports from agencies involved in mine reclamation. He accused the proponents, headed by Rep. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, of rushing the bill and said it was `` not fiscally responsible'' to expand the provisions of the 1977 law `` The fund should be narrowed, not expanded,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who led floor debate for the bill, said that despite the work to remove scars left by previous mining practices the number of abandoned sites `` is still overwhelming He acknowledged that the problems addressed by the bill are regional ones but said that many compromises were made to satisfy the western states. Rep. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, D-Ky., said `` thousands of acres are still in need'' of reclamation and spoke graphically of the landslide problems caused by the combination of flooding and abandoned mines Fees mandated by the legislation are used to pay for reclamation of mine sites abandoned before 1977 when no one else has the responsibility under federal or state law. The fees would be unchanged under the bill _ 35 cents per ton for surface-mined coal, 15 cents a ton for underground coal and 10 cents a ton for a type of coal known as lignite, or brown coal. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates that extending collection of coal reclamation fees beyond 1992 would increase federal revenues by $ 234 million in 1993 and $ 213 million in 1994, but that fee compliance activities in those two years would increase outlays by $ 11 million. The new abandoned non-coal mine reclamation fund would total $ 6 million in fiscal 1991 through 1994.

 A consultant supplied a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company with details of closed sessions of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

At the time, REI had hired a politically well-connected consultant, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gnau </PERSON>, at the suggestion of then-board of governors vice chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>. <PERSON> Voss </PERSON> later pleaded guilty to taking an illegal gratuity from <PERSON> Gnau </PERSON> in connection with the competition for the postal automation equipment. During one hectic week in the competition with REI in November 1985, <PERSON> Buzard </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> supplied him with names of governors who in a closed session had given speeches in support of Electrocom. <PERSON> Buzard </PERSON> also acknowledged it was <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> who reported to him that REI's closed-door presentation to the board on the automation contract had n't been persuasive and had provided `` nothing new.'' <PERSON> Buzard </PERSON> sought to deemphasize the information <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> provided, saying it dealt with the `` quality, not content'' of board of governors' meetings. Under questioning from REI legal counsel <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Buzard </PERSON> said he had n't been aware the information <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> was providing was from meetings that were closed. <PERSON> Buzard </PERSON> said he never asked and that <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> never said where he got his information about board meetings. <PERSON> Buzard </PERSON> acknowledged that in 1986 he refused to identify <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> by name to postal inspectors investigating allegations of contract irregularities. <PERSON> Buzard </PERSON> simply told them that <ORGANIZATION> Electrocom </ORGANIZATION> had hired a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consultant who was `` well-placed.'' <PERSON> Buzard </PERSON> said he refused to identify <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> because the consultant did n't want the identity of his clients disclosed. Electrocom has been awarded the work for the automation equipment. In a brief interview, <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> said he was unfamiliar with <PERSON> Buzard </PERSON>'s testimony and so would have no immediate comment Outside the courtroom, <PERSON> Buzard </PERSON> declined to say how much <ORGANIZATION> Electrocom </ORGANIZATION> had paid <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The fading popularity of President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s governing party will be tested in four special parliamentary elections beginning Tuesday. Six candidates opposed to <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s avowed aim of a one-party state in one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s few Western-style democracies will challenge four contenders from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The outcome from the elections in rural areas will be a barometer of support for <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s movement. Most of the country's 9 million people live in such areas. The by-elections were set for Tuesday and Wednesday in the parliamentary districts of <LOCATION> Chirumanzu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gwanda </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kariba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Masvingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>. Results are expected to be announced Thursday. The voting comes at a time of mounting disenchantment with a government that took over when the British colony of <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> gained independence as <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> in 1980. Many Zimbabweans are now upset about reports of top-level corruption and self-aggrandizement by politicians who preach egalitarian ideals. Many in this country also complain about rising prices and shortages of basic commodities, mounting unemployment and a breakdown in public services. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> was closed after violent anti-government demonstrations. At least 15 students remained in detention. The country's top labor leader, <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsvangirai </PERSON>, was also detained after he supported the students. In addition, at least 11 officials of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> who campaigned for this week's by-election in the <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kariba </LOCATION> constituency were detained on unspecified allegations. At least 150,000 voters have registered for the by-elections, which will send candidates to the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The seats were left vacant by the resignations of three politicians linked to official corruption and another politician who died. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s party is supported by all but two lawmakers in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and the 40-seat <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON>, holds one seat and an independent the other. <PERSON> Tekere </PERSON>'s movement vows to crush official corruption, attract foreign investment to create new jobs, and to keep <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> a multiparty socialist democracy. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> says he wants <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> transformed into a one-party state after general elections before April next year. To legally achieve his aim, he needs the unanimous support of Parliament.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took an unseasonably balmy afternoon off from work on Monday to play golf and his spokesman said anyone begrudging him the outing `` is just silly.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> played with champion golfer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON>, House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Mo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandy </PERSON>, a country singer Also playing with president, but in another foursome, were <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulze </PERSON>, R-Pa., and golf pro <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who flew by helicopter from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> golf course, about 10 miles away, miffed his first drive on the first hole; he took it again and the second one brought applause from spectators. `` We will edit out that first one,'' <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON> said. The president declined to answer questions shouted at him at one point by reporters on the recent failed <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> coup, saying `` I never discuss intelligence matters on the golf course.'' He also said it was too beautiful a day to take questions _ sunny and with temperatures in the upper 60s. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> shrugged off questions at his daily news briefing about whether the president should be taking the day off with so many national problems pressing. `` The president works 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And for anyone to begrudge him an afternoon of golf is just silly,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after picking up his ball following two missed putts on the 18th hole, told reporters: `` Well, here's the way it worked out, just for the sports world commentators here: `` On the front side, the match headed by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON> won. I happened to be a member of that team. And on the backside, the match headed by <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> won.

 <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, who weighed just 15 ounces when she was born three months prematurely and was given little chance of survival, celebrates her first birthday Friday. `` She's doing extremely well,'' <PERSON> Christy </PERSON>'s 28-year-old mother, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, said Monday. When she was born Oct. 27, the baby measured 10 inches. Specialists at Our Lady of <ORGANIZATION> Lourdes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> gave her a less than a 5 percent chance of survival. She was hospitalized for five months before her discharge in March. Today, the brown-haired, brown-eyed infant weighs a little more than 12 pounds and is 23 inches high. `` Her survival and the fact that she has done medically so well is remarkable. When people hear about her, they ca n't believe it,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Souza </PERSON>, director of the intensive care unit for newborns. <PERSON> Christy </PERSON>'s survival boosted morale among nurses and other staff members in the unit, where another infant who was as small as <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> at birth is recovering, the doctor said. `` It's made us feel really good,'' said <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Souza </PERSON>, who has cared for <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> since the child's birth. `` ... This has shown us even if we save one out of 20, it's worth it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said she no longer thinks of her child as the `` miracle baby,'' as the infant was called at the hospital. But she remembered her daughter's struggle for life recently when she read a journal she began when the girl was nine days old. `` It just seems like so long ago,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>. `` It seems like a different lifetime _ a different baby.'' The past year has n't been easy for the family, which is struggling to pay about $ 7,000 in hospital bills not covered by insurance. Mrs. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said the family plans a quiet, private party for <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> on Friday at their home in Tabernacle, 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, which is across the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` She's not like your typical 1-year-old who can sit there and open gifts,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, who also has a 9-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON>. `` Maybe we'll save that for her second birthday.'' <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> suffered a urinary tract infection during the summer, but otherwise has been relatively healthy since her release from the hospital. Medical checkups have been scaled back from once a week to once a month. She is beginning to roll over on her stomach and can sit up with a boost, her mother said. Her social skills are equivalent to an 8-or 9-month-old baby and her speech and physical development are on the level of a 6-month-old. The baby has about an 80 percent chance of living a normal life, but will require constant medical attention in her early years, said <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Souza </PERSON>. Because of lung damage, <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> will have to breathe from a oxygen tank for several more months, and will continue to be fed intravenously until she gains more weight. Mrs. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> gives the child chest therapy four times a day to help her breathe, and a nurse helps care for <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> eight hours each week. A therapist will continue to visit once a week until the child is 3 years old to monitor her speech, hearing and motor development. `` It's taken her a long time to catch up,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` She's pretty behind where she should be.''

 Buck Helm astounded his doctors Monday by nodding his head to show he had no pain, despite being trapped for 90 hours in his tiny car under tons of concrete. `` In the next 24 to 48 hours, if he continues the way he is now, he will be out of the woods,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Huen </PERSON>, medical director at <ORGANIZATION> Highland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` His love for us and our love for him is one of the major things that kept him going,'' his former wife, <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON>, said at a hospital news conference Monday also attended by three of his children. `` Buck is a strong-willed man. For him to survive this long he has proved it,'' she said, adding later, `` He's always been there when I needed him, and this is when he needs us.'' A wave of joy spread through the hospital at news of Helm's condition, <PERSON> Huen </PERSON> said `` When he was asked about whether he was hurting anywhere, he shook his head and everbody was incredulous,'' <PERSON> Huen </PERSON> said. Helm's condition was upgraded Monday from critical to very serious and may improve again to serious, <PERSON> Huen </PERSON> said, adding that Helm was likely to spend two or three more days on a respirator. Helm, 57, had been trapped in his silver <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> under tons of steel and concrete since the earthquake Tuesday toppled a double-decker section of Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. A ship's clerk at the Port of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Terminal </PERSON> at the foot of Market Street, <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> was headed up the freeway to <LOCATION> Emeryville </LOCATION> to a legal poker parlor when the quake hit, dockworkers said. And in the freeway rubble is where he remained, slumped on his right side along the front seat, until rescue workers freed him Saturday. Helm's kidneys, which doctors had feared were so severley damaged by dehydration that he might need dialysis the rest of his life, appeared to be resuming normal function, <PERSON> Huen </PERSON> said. When a person is severely dehydrated, the kidneys shut down to preserve the fluids in the body, <PERSON> Huen </PERSON> said. However, doctors had feared that byproducts of muscle damage could have poisoned the kidneys. `` In his case, he has responded so quickly we feel it was just severe dehydration,'' <PERSON> Huen </PERSON> said. Doctors felt Helm's recovery was coming along so well that they began feeding him through a tube inserted in his stomach and gave him a pencil and a tablet of paper to communicate. Helm, 5-foot-11 and 230 pounds, ca n't talk because a respirator tube has been run down his throat. However, the broken ribs and chest wall separation appear to be mending and doctors have been lowering the amount of oxygen delivered through the respirator, <PERSON> Huen </PERSON> said. Mrs. Helm said she has read newspaper accounts of the earthquake to him, and he understands although he drifts in and out of consciousness. He communicates by nodding, blinking, squeezing her hand, she said. The night before the earthquake, <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> apparently slept, as he usually did, in his rusty yellow Chevrolet panel truck parked at the docks. On the left side of the truck, Helm had painted in orange the words `` <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flash </LOCATION>,'' referring to the little logging town 250 miles away in the <LOCATION> Trinity </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> where he drove every weekend to be with his children. On the right side, he painted a cartoon rabbit and `` Desirees's Delight,'' after his 12-year-old daughter `` He always calls me his rabbit,'' <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON> said at the news conference. `` I love him.'' Inside the van, Helm had a mattress, a Snoopy sleeping bag, two alarm clocks, some clothes, and a panel of photographs of his children, including one of a small child in a huge pair of football shoulderpads. Before work, Helm usually drove to a <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> to wash up, then arrived at his job a little before 8 a.m., said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, chief clerk at the terminal. `` He was a <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION> local,'' said <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>. `` He has tried living down in this area. He had several business enterprises around <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>. I believe he had a sandwich shop and a rent-a-wreck type auto rental which kind of went sour.'' Helm worked out of a small cubicle paneled in tan T-111 siding, where he checked through the big trucks hauling shipping containers bound for overseas. Inside the cubicle, there is nothing to identify Helm. Just a computer terminal, a digital read-out for the truck scale outside, and a printer for papers directing truckdrivers with their loads. During his coffee break, Helm routinely joined the other ship's clerks at a round table in the back of a mobile office to play tonk, the card game of the docks, at a quarter a hand At lunchtime, none of the other clerks knew where Helm went, but he might have taken a walk, because he was trying to lose weight, said clerk <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Marotto </PERSON>. Some of the ship's clerks took off early to watch the World Series, but <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> said he was going to <LOCATION> Emeryville </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Oaks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> to play poker, ship's clerk <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said. Maybe he felt lucky, because that day he'd been a winner at tonk, ship's clerk <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> said Helm's car had more than 200,000 miles logged from the commute to and from <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION>. `` You look at it and think that any collision would kill the occupant.''

<TEXT>
 Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Monday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is exercising necessary prudence in vowing to keep some chemical arms in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenals until all such weapons are eliminated worldwide. But <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, in his third consecutive speech on the issue, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision represents a `` major step backward'' that `` can only result in delay and confusion'' at talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> aimed at banning chemical arms. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, responding to the criticism by <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and other Democrats, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> only seeks to `` keep a deterrent, a modern and credible deterrent, until we are certain there is worldwide participation in a treaty banning chemical weapons.'' `` It seems to me this is a reasonaable and responsible policy,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, noted that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position _ and that of other Western powers _ has been that a global ban on the production of chemical weapons would take effect soon after a treaty entered into force. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> complained there is evidence, contained in published reports not denied by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to produce modern chemical weapons for eight years or more after a treaty goes into effect, updating the chemical weapons stockpile even as its overall size is reduced. Disputes over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policy could cause such delay at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks `` that the opportunity to achieve progress on a global ban on chemical weapons will be lost, perhaps forever,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> asserted. `` The efforts of other countries to attain this capability will proceed, while the arms control process will be stalled as the result of American indecision and inconsistency,'' he said. But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> argued tghat, `` We need some insurance in case we do not get worldwide participation. Keeping our chemical deterrent credible will provide us with that insurance.'' `` As much as we may want to see arms control progress in the area of chemical weapons and elsewhere, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs to look for action, not words, especially when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security is involved,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. In an address to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> last month, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced that as part of a global treaty banning chemical weapons the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would reduce its stockpiles of such weapons by 98 peercent over eight years if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> did the same. The president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would eliminate the remaining 2 percent at the 10th year, but only if all other nations had eliminated their chemical weapons capability. Shortly after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech, press reports quoted unnamed administration officials as saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would produce modern Bigeye chemical weapons throughout the reduction period to make sure the reduced stocks of such arms are as potent as possible. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> referred to these reports and asked: `` How can the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> possibly expect other countries to observe a ban on production if we reserve to ourselves the right to ignore a ban?'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said other nations would insist on such production rights for themselves. `` This means that verifying a chemical weapons ban, hard enough under the best of conditions, will become enormously more difficult,'' he said.

<HEAD>Abortion Issue Reaches Belgian Parliament After 16-Year Battle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opens debate Tuesday on a bill to legalize abortion in a showdown that has been put off for 16 years by legislative maneuvers in this predominantly Roman Catholic country. The issue has divided the center-left government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>. It the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approves the bill, and a vote could be held by Friday, the measure then goes to the more powerful Chamber of Deputies. The measure would allow abortions during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy for `` women in distress.'' Abortions have been illegal in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> for more than 100 years but in 1973 pro-abortion lawmakers sought to introduce legislation changing the law. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> legislators successfully blocked all efforts to bring the issue before Parliament until this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s justice and public health committees voted to change the law that bans abortions and provides for a penalty of up to five years jail for women who have an abortion and those who perform it. In the committees the Socialists voted for legalizing abortion while <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> voted against. The dispute has divided <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>' five-party coalition of Socialists and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, each split into Dutch and French-speaking factions, and the <ORGANIZATION> Flemish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The greatest opposition comes from <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>' Dutch-speaking <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest single political force. Many political observers believe the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> are willing to risk the fate of <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>' government on the outcome. Opinion polls have shown a majaority of Belgians favor legalizing abortions. Although the procedure is banned, enforcement of the law has been spotty and the courts have been lenient to those convicted of violating the measure. It is estimated that 16,000 women have abortions in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> each year and many more go to neighboring <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, where abortions are legal. On the eve of the parliamentary debate, there were indications some Christian Democrat legislators would approve a change that would approve abortions if granted by a special panel that would hold hearings with the women seeking abortions. Pro-abortion forces reject such a compromise, saying the decision must be made only by the woman and her doctor.

<TEXT>
 The Kremlin admitted Monday the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar station violates the Soviet-U.S. ABM treaty and offered to negotiate an end to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military alliances. In a major foreign policy speech in the Soviet legislature, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also criticized the decision by <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> in 1979 to send <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldiers into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He said it involved `` gross violations of our own laws, intra-party and civil norms and ethics.'' `` A decision that had very serious consequences for our country was made behind the back of the party and the people,'' he said. About the military alliances, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said: `` We are prepared to head toward the dissolution of the military-political blocs in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on a mutual basis,'' but added that `` all our obligations remain in force'' despite recent changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> have moved away from one-party <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule in recent months and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has made no move to stop them. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would observe strict principles of non-intervention and `` absolute freedom of choice.'' He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is prepared to liquidate all foreign bases and withdraw its military forces to its own territory by the year 2000. What the conditions for such a withdrawal would be was not clear. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the radar station in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> would be dismantled. He said it took <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s government four years to determine that its location violated the 1972 treaty, as Western arms experts contended. As the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> tried to move forward on arms treaties based on the ABM pact, `` there stood the station, the size of an Egyptian pyramid, representing, to put it bluntly, a violation of the ABM treaty,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> declared. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said that the decision to dismantle the giant, phased-array radar at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> was criticized within the country as going against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s interest. In fact, he said, `` We are saving the ABM treaty and opening the way to the conclusion of a treaty on strategic weapons, and we're gaining the legal and moral right to demand clarity on the question of American installations in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> which were modernized, as we understand, in violation of the treaty. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has claimed the treaty does not apply to its modernization of the stations in <LOCATION> Thule </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, and Fylingdales Moor, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, because they were in place before the ABM accord was signed. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration welcomed <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s admission `` It reflects a different kind of mindset,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. `` It's encouraging. It builds a degree of confidence, it builds a degree of trust,'' he told reporters at a briefing on an arms control speech Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was making in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Ground rules of the briefing prevent use of the official's name. After <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> met last month in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, they said in a joint statement: `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> stated that, guided by its long-standing goal of strengthening the ABM treaty regime, it had decided to completely dismantle the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar station. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side expressed satisfaction with this announcement.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, in a news conference at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, told reporters: ` We have decided to fully dismantle that facility, and we expect that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side, too, will act in order to remove our concern with respect to its radars in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.'' The Soviet government has offered repeatedly to turn over the Siberian radar to a civilian agency and partially dismantle it, but always stopped short of admitting the station violated provisions of the ABM treaty. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected as unsatisfactory any plan short of complete dismantling of the station, saying the ABM treaty prohibited the deployment of large radar stations capable of giving early warnings of missile attacks anywhere except on the periphery of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or Soviet territory. The <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> station is deep within <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, several hundred miles north of the Chinese border. The dispute was among the differences that soured U.S.-Soviet arms control talks for years. It was not the first time high-placed Soviets have disclosed that the decision to intervene in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was made by a small circle around the late Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. But it had not previously been characterized by a government spokesman as an outright violation of law. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> noted that for the first time in many years, `` Not a single Soviet soldier is participating _ nor, I'm sure, will participate _ in military actions anywhere in the world.'' He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is prepared to liquidate all its foreign bases and withdraw its military forces to within its own territory by the year 2000. It was not clear what the condition would be for such a withdrawal.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, seeking to smooth relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday he has `` no differences at all'' with the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on the ground rules for covert actions overseas. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> grew testy when questioned by reporters about the issue at the end of a 3 -LCB- - hour golf outing at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> complained to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders in private last week about congressional restrictions on actions by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents overseas. The president reportedly griped that the restrictions, if narrowly interpreted, could have required <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials to warn Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in advance of any impending coup that could endanger his life. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., the chairman of the intelligence panel, responded angrily Sunday night, saying `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are being deliberately misled'' by selective leaks of `` highly classified correspondence. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters, `` I have no differences at all with Mr. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> on all of this, and he knows it, and we know it, and that's a good thing for the whole situation.'' Asked specifically about <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>'s complaint about leaks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` He's in good shape. He and I are thinking together on these things.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside another question about rewriting the intelligence guidelines. `` Let me tell you something,'' said the president, who was once director of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't discuss intelligence matters. It's just not intelligence if you do that. That's not the way you treat it.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said earlier that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> had `` discussed the whole question of micromanagement and of intelligence activities in these areas. The president feels that any differences they may have had have been ironed out.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was working with <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> and the committee on possible changes, but added, `` There will be no change in the ban on assassinations _ bar none.'' A policy imposed by then-President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> in 1976 bars <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agents from taking part in any effort to assassinate foreign leaders. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has complained that <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> guidelines inhibited the administration's flexibility in responding to events in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> leading up to the failed attempt Oct. 3 to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under federal indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on charges of drug trafficking. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said the report of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s complaints about the policy was a `` selective leak'' that distorted the situation at the time of his panel's October 1988 letter to then-President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. While not acknowledging details of the policy, <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said his letter merely restated the committee's understanding of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> guidelines to carry out a 14-year-old ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in assassinations of foreign leaders. `` Our letter stated their policy as it had been told to us,'' said a committee source. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, in a statement, said, `` The plain truth is, there are ambiguities in the record'' on both the congressional and executive side.

 The trial of a police officer who killed a black motorcyclist, sparking three days of racial violence, opened Monday with the defense demanding the case be moved as demonstrators clashed outside. Colombian-born <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> faces two manslaughter counts in the Jan. 16 shooting of the motorcylist <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, as he was being chased by police, and the death of his passenger, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, who was fatally injured when the motorcycle crashed. While small groups of black and Hispanic demonstrators faced off outside the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courthouse, attorneys and spectators inside were put through two sets of metal detectors and had bags and briefcases searched. Attorneys spent Monday selecting potential jurors. They finished midway through the initial screening process and expected to continue jury selection all day Tuesday. Earlier, defense attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> listed for <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> the extraordinary measures adopted by local police worried about a violent reaction to the trial. Police have bought 700 gas masks and made arrangements for use of two armored personnel carriers. `` I ca n't remember any trial in which it was necessary to buy armored personnel carriers to prepare for it,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said, arguing the trial must be moved. `` We ca n't prevent a riot, but we can ensure jurors are not worried about it.'' Four times this decade, police slayings of black men or subsequent innocent verdicts in their trials have touched off racial violence in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. As a result, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said jurors in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> might be afraid to acquit <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> and touch off new rioting. Potential jurors had to pass by two small groups of demonstrators on the courthouse steps Monday, with blacks carrying signs such as `` Stop Killing Black Men,'' while Hispanics, some of them members of <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s family, waved <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s flag. One man, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardemon </PERSON>, was arrested when he tried to force his way past police guarding the courthouse doorway. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, lead prosecutor for the state, said he was not concerned about the tension affecting jurors. `` The test is not whether they have heard of the case, the test is whether or not they can base a decision on the evidence in court,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> told the judge. `` We've been able to get juries in other high publicity cases here in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.'' Attorneys estimated it could take weeks of addressing pre-trial motions before the actual trial testimony begins. Outside the courtroom, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, sister of the slain motorcyclist, called for the black community not to prjudge the trial. `` Stay calm and let the trial go on,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. `` I hope he gets convicted.'' <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jairo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, also a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> policeman, said the demonstrations and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s history make it impossible to find an impartial jury. `` He will not get a fair trial here in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jairo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> said. `` But if they move the trial out of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, justice will be done, because what he did was in self-defense.'' <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> said he fired at <LOCATION> Lloyd </LOCATION> because the speeding motorcycle headed straight for him. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> died instantly of a bullet to the head, while <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> died of head injuries suffered in the crash. The slaying touched off burning and looting in predominantly black neighborhoods. One person was killed, 11 were wounded by gunfire and 13 structures burned down only days before the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area was host to the Super Bowl. Tensions, especially between blacks and Hispanics, remained high after the violence.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> tried to play down tensions with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Monday after his aides reportedly said he may cancel a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over differences on how to achieve peace. Maariv, a leading Israeli daily newspaper, quoted the aides as saying <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> may cancel his mid-November trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> if the divisions persist. One unidentified source in <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office was quoted as saying, `` We fear that differences of opinion between the prime minister and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, if expressed face-to-face, will cause an explosion.'' However, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said later on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio, `` I can only state there are some disagreements, they are not very sharp and I'm convinced we can certainly overcome them. Speaking on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> denied the visit was in doubt. `` We're not running away from our views and the need to express them,'' he said. The exact dates of the trip have not been announced. In another development, a senior aide to Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said that leader's planned visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was in doubt. He indicated Kremlin officials have not responded to requests for top-level meetings. In more unrest in the occupied territories Monday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops shot and killed <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Libde </PERSON>, 19, and wounded at least six other people, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army confirmed the youth was killed during a military operation at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>. The death brought to 601 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli gunfire in the 22-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Forty Israelis have been killed in the violence. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> confirmed in a telephone interview that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials were divided over how to carry out <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s proposal for elections in the occupied lands. `` We hope this will all be straightened out before the meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s plan calls for elections in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to choose Palestinian representatives for negotiations on limited self-rule for the territories. The status of the occupied lands would be decided later. The U.S.-Israeli differences stem from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to arrange an initial meeting with Palestinians to revive the stalled plan. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the television the key points in dispute were <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s insistance that no members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> sit on a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation to talks and that only matters related to elections be discussed. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opened a fresh <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> debate about the plan of Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was considering it despite <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s objections. Speaking to high school students in suburban <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, he said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposals `` have not been rejected or accepted'' and should be considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also came under fire Monday from the other side of the political spectrum. <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s rival in the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had told Americans one thing and Israelis something different. `` This has been a dangerous road from the beginning,'' he said. `` There's no place for a conflict with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and I think there would have been no conflict if we spoke clearly.'' The <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> aide, meanwhile, said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> would make a final decision in mid-November about whether to make his trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The aide, <PERSON> Nimrod </PERSON> <PERSON> Novick </PERSON>, returned to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> this week after trying to work out details of the trip, which has not yet been scheduled. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has been invited to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by the non-governmental <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. However, the minister, who also serves as <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, is reportedly seeking a meeting with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> or Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> is currently in a hospital recovering from a urinary infection.

<HEAD>Sex Game `Foreplay' Found in Ambulance Computer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL STIEG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sex-oriented game is in the computer that monitors city ambulances, but an official on Monday dismissed speculation that the game could distract dispatchers or lead to computer problems. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrofsky </PERSON>, a computer consultant for the <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said in Monday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that the game `` Foreplay'' had been in the EMS system since September 1988. The program could slow the computer or stop it for 30 minutes, <PERSON> Petrofsky </PERSON> said. It also might carry a computer `` virus'' that could shut down the computer for two days, he said. <ORGANIZATION> EMS </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> said the inspector general of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had confirmed that the game was in the system, but she said it had no effect on response time, which has been reduced in recent months. It was not clear who entered the game into the system, or whether dispatchers or those who receive emergency calls even had access to it, she said. Investigators were searching the master computer Monday, she said. `` As soon as we find anything inappropriate, like this game or anything else, it will be taken out of the computer,'' she said. `` When we find who's responsible, they'll be dealt with appropriately.'' <PERSON> Petrofsky </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> at least 35 employees could gain access to the game at one time, but the story did not say which employees. `` To make the implication that -LRB- dispatchers and call receivers -RRB- do n't do their work is ludicrous and unfair to them,'' <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> said. `` These are very hard-working and dedicated individuals who are very insulted that someone would make allegations that they were playing games when they're supposed to be dispatching ambulances.'' The game involves the seduction of a woman, with players choosing various tactics to gain `` arousal points,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The wrong move can get a player kicked out of the woman's apartment. <PERSON> Petrofsky </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> he was fired last week after warning superiors over the past eight months of threats posed by the game. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> declined to comment on his dismissal, except to say there were many protections for such whistle-blowers and that <ORGANIZATION> EMS </ORGANIZATION> `` encourages him to use the number of appeal procedures available.'' <PERSON> Petrofsky </PERSON> said he told his boss, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, about the game on March 23, but <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> he did not remember discussing such a game. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said he did not know why <PERSON> Petrofsky </PERSON> was fired, and said to ask <ORGANIZATION> EMS </ORGANIZATION> deputy executive director <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Margusee </PERSON>, who is on vacation. Petrofsky produced records that showed the game was entered into the system on Sept. 19, 1988, and revised twice since then.

 RADAR STATION The power of perestroika does not in itself insure us against mistakes. It's important not to hide them, to admit them and correct them. In this respect, the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar installation issue is very significant. It took us four years to get to the bottom of it. We were charged with violation of the ABM treaty because of the station. It took the government quite a while to learn all the truth of the project. Finally, we saw it clearly: The station had been built on the wrong site, not where it should have been. All these years, we have been working hard to keep up the ABM treaty as a foundation for strategic stability. We have been looking for options and having very complicated debates on the interpretation of each article of the treaty and its supplements' contents And all the while, there stood the station, the size of an Egyptian pyramid, representing, to put it bluntly, a violation of the ABM treaty. At last we resolved this issue and announced we would dismantle the station. This has brought some discontent in the country, as if we were foregoing our own interests. In fact, we are saving the ABM treaty and opening the way to the conclusion of the treaty on strategic weapons, and we're gaining the legal and moral right to demand clarity on the question of American installations in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> which were modernized, we understand, in violation of the treaty.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> should repay up to $ 100 million donated by his <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> followers as well as go to jail for his fraud and conspiracy conviction, prosecutors said Monday. `` Fraud in the name of a religious organization is conduct which must be deterred and punished,'' the prosecutors said in a sentencing recommendation. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was convicted Oct. 5 of 24 counts charging he defrauded followers of his television ministry, selling lodging guarantees at his Christian retreat when he knew rooms were n't available at his inns. Followers sent more than $ 158 million for the lodging rights. The jury found that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> used more than $ 3.7 million to buy luxurious homes, fancy cars, jewelry and expensive vacations. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> will be sentenced Tuesday at a hearing in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that is scheduled to start at 2 p.m. He faces 120 years in prison and a fine of more than $ 5.2 million. Prosecutors filed the memorandum a day earlier with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, whose penchant for stiff penalties has earned him the nickname `` Maximum <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>.'' `` It appears unlikely the lifetime partners will recoup their losses through the bankruptcy proceeding,'' the memo said. `` As a result the government urges that restitution be ordered by the court.'' A letter from lawyers representing the partners was attached to the memo and said unsettled claims made on behalf of various partners would total between $ 90 million and $ 100 million. In the sentencing memo, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> fraud specialist <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> be fined the maximum amount, which totals $ 5.23 million, if restitution was n't ordered. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could n't be reached for comment. His attorney, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, said the defrocked Assemblies of God minister was driving from his <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, home to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> attached character references from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> supporters to his three-page sentencing recommendation and urged the judge to consider alternatives to prison. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> asked the court to `` consider reasonable alternatives and allow this defendant the benefit of the court's compassion and mercy.'' The lawyer also said former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, who was indicted with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, received an eight year prison sentence after pleading guilty. `` It would appear the only difference between this defendant and the co-defendant was that this defendant chose to exercise his constitutional right of trial by jury,'' <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> had no comment on the government's sentencing recommendation and said he planned to meet Monday night with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>.

I am referring of course to our military engagement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It should teach us a lesson that in this case, gross violations of our own laws, intraparty and civil norms and ethics were allowed. At the time I am speaking about, M.S. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I were candidate -LRB- non-voting -RRB- members of the Politburo. I found out about what had happened from radio and newspaper reports. A decision that had very serious consequences for our country was made behind the back of the party and the people. We were confronted with a fait accompli.

 MILITARY WITHDRAWAL For the first time in many years, not a single <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldier is participating _ nor, I'm sure, will participate _ in military actions anywhere in the world. We have now put forth the initiative of curtailing all of our military bases abroad as well as our military presence there by the year 2000. We are prepared to head toward the dissolution of the military-political blocs in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on a mutual basis.

 HUMAN RIGHTS It's shameful to admit that, not long ago, we would say, `` so-called human rights,'' and claimed we did n't have any problems with them. In the addressing and solving of humanitarian issues, we have made a genuine, psychological, political, legal breakthrough, and reached world standards.

 Lord <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldington </PERSON> required hospital treatment Monday after he stumbled in a courtroom during a High Court libel trial over allegations that he is a war criminal. The 75-year-old peer fell as he stepped down from a bench beside his lawyer's desk and suffered a graze on the head and a bloody nose. <PERSON> Aldington </PERSON>, the former deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is claiming libel damages over allegations in a pamphlet published by historian Count <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>, a property developer. The pamphlet claimed <PERSON> Aldington </PERSON>, an army chief of staff at the end of World War II, arranged the repatriation in 1945 of 70,000 Cossacks and Yugoslavs to the Communists knowing they would be massacred on their return. Many of the 70,000 had fought on the German side during the war. They had fallen into Allied hands on the collapse of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at the end of the war. Their return was demanded by the late Soviet leader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> suggested Monday that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> are rigging the campaign for the Feb. 25 general elections. During debate in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said the Sandinista government views democratic reform as `` little more than another obstacle to be overcome in continuing to violate international, hemispheric and regional commitments.'' His allegations disputed a report by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> election monitors sent to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The report, released last week, said the monitors found <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> gave `` no undue benefits'' to the Sandinistas and `` there is appreciable concern on the part of the members of the council to ensure the broadest possible participation by political groups and citizens.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring mission is led by former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> told the assembly, `` We remain concerned over actions by the Nicaraguan government to limit the access by the Nicaraguan opposition parties to the media and to limit the opposition's ability to campaign to a broad public. He said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also is `` concerned by the reported presence of armed soldiers at <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> voter registration centers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report noted opposition parties receive free time on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s channel 2, which reaches only the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast and interior, while the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have sole use of the more powerful channel 6. But the report added `` the use of radio and television for political propaganda began too recently for any in-depth discussion of the question to be possible at this stage.'' The report covered the period from July 5 to Sept. 30. Voter registration for the Feb. 25 elections was held on the first four Sundays in October. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said that on the first three Sundays 1,336,342 citizens had registered out of an estimated 1,970,486 eligible voters. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> adopted by consensus a resolution praising progress toward peaceful resolutions of the conflicts in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> following agreements by five Central American presidents at a conference in August. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, however, accused <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of undermining the peace process by shipping weapons to the leftist rebels fighting the U.S.-backed government in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` There is no doubt that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> regularly, systematically and continually aid, arm and train'' the Salvadoran guerrillas, he said. In another development, Nicaraguan Ambassador <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldera </PERSON> said his government might bar Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, from returning to the country after a Dec. 5 deadline. The August agreement, known as the Tela Accord, involves among other issues the disarming and disbanding of the Contras by Dec. 5. Many of the Contras are in bases across the border in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldera </PERSON>, speaking with reporters outside the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Non-compliance with the agreement would mean <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> could adopt the position that it is not bound by the agreement to receive the Contras.'' `` I would emphasize that the Tela Accord must be totally complied with,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said the <ORGANIZATION> Tela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accord </ORGANIZATION> requires only the voluntary disbanding of the estimated 11,000 Contras in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and many of the rebels do not want to return to their homeland until democratic elections have been held. Free and democratic elections in <LOCATION> Nicarauga </LOCATION> are a provision of the Tela Accord.

 Boarding one of the first ferryboats pressed into emergency service Monday to carry commuters across <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, I expected a romantic ride through the fog. Reality brought nausea. The worst storm of the season struck just an hour before tens of thousands of residents in <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> counties east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> began the trek to work. This 127-foot ocean vessel, one of 14 being run on routes unused by ferries for decades, met blustery winds, giant swells that crashed across the bow and waves that sent it constantly lurching from side to side. The song of the journey should be, `` I Left My Stomach on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>.'' The 55-minute voyage, made necessary because of the collapse of a 50-foot section of the vital <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> during last Tuesday's quake, was twice what was expected. The triple-deck monohull pulled away from the dock 40 minutes late because of weather worries and a low passenger count. The captain announced some boats might be turned back. A big groan. I arrived dockside before dawn, naively thinking I could relive idyllic bay crossings created by writers like <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> and in such classic movies as <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>'s `` Dark Passage.'' I was n't alone. `` I've just been through hell, but heck, I have to admit I made it through it; it can only get better, this ca n't get much worse,'' said an ashen-faced <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Trowbridge </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, who came onto the deck to alleviate sea sickness. I moved up to the bow, where a giant swell drenched me. Since I was downwind, I figured it would be best to remain there in case I lost my breakfast. The ferry, with a capacity of 700 people and carrying 338, was supposed to dock at the Ferry Building in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. But waves craching there forced the boats to divert to Fisherman's Wharf. Altogether my commute _ from hearth to work station _ took 3 -LCB- hours. I used to do it in 45 minutes. At the wharf, I tried to catch a cable car into downtown, only to find it shut down. I walked another seven blocks in the drenching rain and caught a city bus to work. Roughing it across the bay did n't dampen everybody's spirits. `` Considering everything, my commute has really gone smooth,'' said <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, 42, of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, used to work on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, ferries, and was unflappable. `` Everybody's just going to have to go into slow motion,'' she said. `` That includes all the bosses.'' <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierini </PERSON> 44, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, recalled taking ferries to <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> as a child. She relived those memories Monday morning. `` This makes up for all the bad things that came out of the earthquake,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> research nurse. The weather was trying for <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Crowley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION>, which operated the ferries. He rode the <ORGANIZATION> Catalina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Empress </ORGANIZATION>, which normally operates between <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` Mother nature is testing our mental state; normally this bay is as smooth as glass at this time,'' said <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>. About 3,000 people used the ferries Monday morning, <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON> said. Ferryboat service to the East bay, which began in 1863, grew to include hundreds of boats at its height in the early 1930s. It was discontinued shortly after the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> bridge opened in 1937.

 `` Look Who's Talking'' claimed the No. 1 box office spot for the second weekend in a row, proving <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON>'s comeback was not short-lived, according to figures released Monday. Grossing $ 14.1 million, the comedy starring <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kirstie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> as the voice of a baby from conception to infancy finished almost $ 10 million ahead of second-place `` Next of Kin.'' `` Next of Kin,'' featuring <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swayze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Liam </PERSON> <PERSON> Neeson </PERSON> pursuing their brother's killer, collected $ 4.8 million in ticket sales, according to Exhibitor Relations Co.

The dead-teenager sequel `` Halloween V: The Revenge of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>'' landed in sixth with a gate of $ 2.79 million, down a sharp 45 percent from its opening weekend. In seventh was `` The Fabulous Baker Boys,'' with <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON>, which took $ 2.78 million. Falling four notches to eighth was <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>'s prison movie, `` An Innocent Man,'' grossing $ 2.3 million. In ninth was the bittersweet family comedy `` Parenthood,'' with $ 1.51 million. In last place among the Top 10 was the new `` Fat Man and Little Boy,'' starring <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> in the story of the creation of the atomic bomb. The movie failed to explode, collecting only $ 1.48 million for a terrible opening per-screen average of $ 1,752. Although <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s `` Crimes and Misdemeanors'' did n't make the leader board, it was up 1.5 percent from its opening weekend on positive word of mouth. Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in release.

 Lebanese Christians were split Monday over Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s rejection of a plan to end the civil war and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> put his men on alert in case of renewed fighting with Syrian troops and their Moslem allies. Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, the two main militias of the 1.2 million Shiite Moslems, and <PERSON> Druse </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> also rejected the accord. It was approved Sunday by Lebanese Christian and Moslem legislators after three weeks of negotiations in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Lebanese ally. An aide to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said the general put <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army units, which number about 20,000 men, on alert to `` cope with all eventualities.'' Leave was canceled and troops were ordered to stay in barracks, he said, speaking privately, but added: `` We're not going to war. It's a defensive measure.'' Hundreds of people were killed and thousands wounded, nearly all of them civilians, before a truce last month in an artillery war that began March 8 between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces and a Moslem alliance led by Syrian troops. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, a year after the sectarian civil war began. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> calls the Syrians an occupation army and has declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive them out. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` warmly welcomes'' the peace plan, which she said provided `` a unique chance'' to end a war that has killed at least 150,000 Lebanese. `` The challenge now is for all concerned parties to seize this extraordinary opportunity to consolidate and implement what has been achieved,'' she said. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` congratulates the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> deputies for their courage and statesmanship, which have yielded an extraordinary opportunity to bring lasting peace in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> announced his rejection Sunday night and criticized <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, a legislator who leads the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> political parties. The Kuwaiti daily Al-Watan on Monday quoted <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as saying: `` I say to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, do n't sign and return home. If he signs, his signature commits him personally. Let him come and impose by force what he agreed to if he can overpower me and dismiss me.'' The Lebanese legislators went Monday from Taif to the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION> for a closing session scheduled for Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION>, 24 <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> legislators led by <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON> met to discuss <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s rejection and then issued a statement saying, `` It's a crime to let this opportunity slip away, an opportunity which might not be repeated. `` It was a choice between a continuation of the destructive war and peace. ... It was a wise choice if compared with negative rejections.'' Pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement declaring: `` Any solution from <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> does not concern us. ... The only system that safeguards justice and equality is Islam.'' <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, in his rejection, called the accord `` silly and sectarian.'' He said it `` obstructs the construction of a new, democratic and modern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' About 5,000 <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> supporters demonstrated Monday outside his residence _ the bomb-ravaged presidential palace in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, a Christian suburb. `` Withdrawing confidence from those who have gone to another ... land which is not ours is a must,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> told the crowd. The deputies who met in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> `` must understand that their role is over and that now it is your turn, yours alone,'' he said. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> declared: `` What happened in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> is a mistake that should be corrected! This is the day of option! You have to choose between free existence or capitulation and humiliation!'' Sources close to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s splintered government, said he feels he has the constitutional power to disband <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and declare martial law. Moslems support the cabinet of acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who supported the Taif peace plan, said: `` The only alternative we envisage to the accord is suicide. No one has the right to take a decision to commit suicide on behalf of the people and the nation. This could be the last chance to lead the Lebanese out of the sea of fury to the shore of peace.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s main objection to the peace accord is its lack of a timetable for Syrian withdrawal. It provides for the Syrians, who control more than 70 percent of Lebanese territory, to move into the eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in a two-year phased pullback from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and its environs. Sixty-three legislators began meeting in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> on Sept. 30, choosing a site outside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to avoid pressure from the various Lebanese factions. Fifty-nine deputies voted for the draft Sunday, two abstained, one was opposed and one was missing because of illness. Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would be expanded from 99 seats to 108, equally divided between Moslems and Christians. Christians have controlled the government, judiciary and army since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, when they were the majority. Moslems have become the majority since and demand more power.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s most senior <ORGANIZATION> supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION> justice pleaded guilty to drunken driving charges Monday, and promised not to participate in any drunken driving decisions for at least a year. `` My shame and embarassment are beyond my ability to express,'' <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, 64, of <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> said in a statement following his plea and sentencing in a courtroom a block from his own chambers. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenox </PERSON> suspended <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>'s license for a year after the justice pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and refusing to submit to a Breathalyzer test. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> followed court custom and excused himself from oral arguments in a case questioning the legality of the Breathalyzer test, which police use to determine the amount of alcohol in the blood. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, who has served on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s seven-member high court longer than any other justice, was arrested in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION> early Oct. 12 after an officer saw him crossing the highway center line and driving 46 mph in a 35-mph zone. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, who was returning from a dinner, refused to take the test. <PERSON> Lenox </PERSON> also fined <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> $ 500 plus court costs, and ordered him to pay a $ 100 surcharge to a rehabilitation fund for alcoholics. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> will also have to pay a $ 3,000 auto insurance surcharge over the next three years. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, who is known for his wit and penetrating questions during oral arguments before the high court, displayed little emotion at his own hearing. Asked by <PERSON> Lenox </PERSON> whether he had driven under the influence and refused to take the Breathalyzer test, <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> replied, `` Yes, sir.'' In his statement, the justice said he would not participate in any drunken driving case for at least the year of his license suspension. `` I have concluded that the best way to prevent any repetition of drinking and driving is to avoid drinking,'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. `` That is my intention, and I will not hesitate to draw on whatever support is necessary to help me fulfill it.'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, refused to make any further comments. The office later issued a statement saying <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>'s case would be referred to the court's <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION>, which could recommend disciplinary measures. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said his conduct let down former Govs. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>, who appointed him to the high court in 1973, and <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, who reappointed him in 1980. `` Most importantly, I did not fulfill the legitimate expectations of the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, who are entitled to nothing short of irreproachable conduct from members of the judiciary,'' he said. `` To all of them I apologize.''

 An earthquake shook the <LOCATION> Alban </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Monday evening, frightening citizens but causing no damage or injuries, authorities said. The quake occurred at about 10.20 p.m. and measured six to seven on the <ORGANIZATION> Mercalli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scale </ORGANIZATION>, roughly equivalent to 3.8 on the Richter Scale, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> reported. The epicenter was near <LOCATION> Ariccia </LOCATION>, a town about 12 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Alban </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. A quake of similar magnitude jolted the same area last Friday but caused no damage. The Civil Protection Ministry reported no damage or casualties but police said scores of residents fled into the streets in panic and some families decided to spend the night in their cars. The quake was also felt throughout this capital. Residents said they felt floors shaking for about 10 seconds.

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on Monday approved a $ 2.85 billion aid package for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake, more than the White House supported but $ 1 billion less than the amount pushed by the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> congressional delegation. The plan was approved by voice vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> after the panel rejected, 26-7, the state delegation's request for $ 3.8 billion Committee chairman <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, D-Miss., said more money could come later but he did n't want to send too much, too soon with too few controls `` My whole pitch is to do something now, straighten it out later, and do n't waste any money in the meantime,'' <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass., the senior Republican on the committee, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration could accept <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>'s The White House had proposed earmarking less than $ 2.5 billion, with nearly $ 1 billion of that coming from existing federal accounts. Full House action was expected on Tuesday, as the aid was attached to a stopgap spending bill which must be sent to the President by Wednesday to avert a government shutdown on Thursday. Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., who led his state's effort in the committee, said the $ 2.85 billion `` does not, of course, meet all our needs. He said he was also concerned that the committee refused to waive requirements for local matching of some of the federal highway aid. The committee votes came during a somewhat testy session, during which lawmakers from other states questioned why <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s aid package should be so big. Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>., proposed and then withdrew an amendment which would have allocated $ 5 billion for his home state to compensate for the hurricane damage it has suffered in hurricanes since the turn of the century Rep. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Regula </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, said he was `` troubled by the lack of accountability'' in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> plan. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should `` look at it a lot more carefully with hearings,'' he suggested. `` We are the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and I think there is a certain amount of jealousy,'' <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> said afterward. The committee approved $ 1.1 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to repair the devastation and $ 1 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency fund. Most of the fatalities, and the worst damage from the quake, was related to highway structures. In addition, $ 500 million would be given to the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for emergency loans, and $ 250 million for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to spend at his discretion on other operations. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> delegation, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' largest at 47 members, had wanted $ 1 billion for highway repair, $ 1.1 billion for <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.2 billion for <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> disaster loans and $ 100 million for loans to low-income people. The president would have been given a $ 400 million discretionary fund. The White House was proposing a more modest $ 2.5 billion package, of which only $ 1.5 billion would be spending beyond what's already available in the federal budget The White House proposed no new <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> spending authority and no discretionary fund for the president. If proposed only $ 600 million for highway repair, $ 500 million in additional spending, with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> using local money and insurance, when appropriate, to pay for part of the roadway costs instead of having the federal government covering virtually the entire tab. The Californians said their estimates of the damage were now in excess of $ 7 billion. <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> told the committee that experts have led him to believe it can grow to more than $ 10 billion. `` The state will have to come up with huge sums of money, but the federal government will have to help,'' he said. `` We're not going to ask anybody to gild any lilies.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing that his estimate of the total cost was over $ 7 billion, although he did n't expect the federal government to pay that `` The human suffering and anguish can never be compensated, but we can attempt to deal to the extent possible with the physical and economic losses,'' said <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority whip. Congressional discussion barely touched on how to pay for aid to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials have been talking about raising state taxes, both the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were loath to make such a suggestion. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., tried unsuccessfully in the committee to remove a provision in the bill waiving the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law With that provision in the bill, the cost will be added to the federal deficit. `` I do n't like that approach but ultimately our first priority is to help the victims of this kind of disaster,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> whose district south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> suffered heavy damage One congressional budget expert said there was no way to rein in the federal cost, because politicians do n't want to be seen as Scrooges. Another said members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> do n't want to be seen as `` the skunk at the picnic.'' Both spoke on condition that their names not be used.

 <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> had just moved into an apartment Friday near the site of the Cypress offramp of the <ORGANIZATION> Nimitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeway </ORGANIZATION>, which had collapsed only days earlier in a massive earthquake. On Monday, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> was temporarily homeless because of a decision to remove a portion of unstable freeway near his apartment. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and more than 100 residents of a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> public housing project were told to leave their homes Sunday afternoon after engineers concluded the freeway section near four of the project's buildings might collapse. Residents were told to leave their homes immediately _ and leave most belongings behind. `` We were all scared,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. `` We were all wondering, ` What's going on now?' I thought there'd been another earthquake.'' While some residents were able to find their own temporary shelter, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> took his Bible and some other books to the <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where he joined about 160 other people, some of whom had been there since last week. They sat on cots in the school gymnasium, eating food provided by local agencies and trying to figure out relief forms. `` I'll be glad when it's all straightened out,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. `` One minute you're home and the next minute you're out and you do n't know why. There's confusion and chaos here.'' Engineers estimate it may take 48 hours to take down the section of freeway which imperiled the neighborhood, and it may be 24 hours more before the residents can return. `` We are very aware of the problems people are going through,'' said <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wraa </PERSON>. `` But the safety of the citizens overpowered the need to let them get their belongings.'' The west end of the housing project is within 20 feet of the endangered freeway and if it had fallen on its own, `` a tremendous amount of damage could be done and people could be hurt,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CalTrans </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. What caused the most confusion was the short notice given, with residents first being told they had to begin leaving immediately at 3:30 p.m. Sunday. Rumors bounced from house to house, ranging from another earthquake to the possibility of a gas leak.

 The construction of the Xingo dam, a massive public works project of the outgoing administration of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, is being halted because of a cash shortage, company officials announced Monday. A three-company consortium in charge of building the dam said the federal government was $ 138 million behind in payments to the project. As a result, the consortium must halt construction within 24 hours and lay off 2,050 workers, officials said. `` We've gone as far as we could, but we're convinced that we're never going to see this money, `` said consortium superintendent <PERSON> Ruiter </PERSON> <PERSON> Neto </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> at a Monday press conference in the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Recife </LOCATION> However, <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> said the group will resume work if the government pays its debt.

 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> declared itself a democracy Monday, 33 years after Soviet troops crushed an anti-Stalinist uprising, and chants of `` Russians go home!'' and `` Communism no more!'' rose from a crowd of 100,000. Hungarian flags of red, white and green waved over the throng, which overflowed the Parliament square. People cheered wildly in the torch-lit plaza when participants in the uprising invoked memories of its leaders. `` It took 33 years for those behind the thick walls to hear the cries'' for democracy, <PERSON> Jenoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonay </PERSON>, a prominent activist who was earlier involved in the uprising, told the rally. He was referring to the recent official change of heart about the nature of the 12-day revolt that began Oct. 23, 1956. The Soviet bloc's bloodiest uprising was called counterrevolution until early this year, when the official description was changed to a popular uprising in one of the dramatic moves in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s progress toward democracy. As many as 32,000 people were killed in 1956 and about 200,000 fled the country. <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Obersovszky </PERSON>, a writer and editor who was sentenced to death but later pardoned, said: `` I am keeping my fingers crossed for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.'' The crowd called out `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>! <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>!'' `` History has taught us that as long as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is not free, we can not be free either,'' <PERSON> Obersovszky </PERSON> said. He expressed certainty that `` the suppression of the revolution would not have taken place'' if <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Soviet leader who champions reform, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had led the superpowers in 1956. A banner proclaiming `` Freedom, Independence'' was draped across the main entrance of Parliament and floodlights bathed the structure. <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasso </PERSON>, a vocal opposition figure jailed for his part in the uprising, drew one of the strongest ovations when he declared: `` We've had enough of Russian occupation!'' Without mentioning names, he appealed to East European allies who oppose reforms to `` help us and not make it more difficult.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said: `` Declaring itself an independent republic on the 33rd anniversary of the popular uprising seems particularly appropriate. We congratulate the Republic of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and its people.'' Hungarian national TV broadcast the entire rally, its cameras panning frequently from the cheering crowd to the balcony with its large photograph of <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, who led the 1956 revolt and was executed. <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s body was exhumed and reburied with honor in June. Some speakers recited patriotic poems, including one that began: `` The streets of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> are running with blood.'' The evening rally followed a proclamation by acting President <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON> formally declaring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> a democracy after 41 years of communist rule. Szueroes declared the communist `` People's Republic of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'' dead from the balcony of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, to the applause of 100,000 people who had filled the square by midday. `` As of today, our nation's ... name is the Republic of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>,'' he said, and church bells throughout the country pealed at noon. State TV also broadcast the midday ceremony, the first commemoration of the uprising ever conducted with official approval. Many people wore arm bands or hair ribbons in the national colors, or waved large flags with jagged holes in the middle to symbolize those of 1956 from which rebels cut the communist emblem. Tears flowed freely as the crowd sang the national anthem on the anniversary, which <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> declared a day of `` national reconciliation.'' Teachers took their entire classes to the square. Few police were visible, and none carried firearms or clubs. Hoots and whistles rose when <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON> called for continued cooperation with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The crowd cheered and applauded when he urged warmer ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The applause was tumultuous applause when he said: `` The Republic of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has become a state governed by law, where the values of ... democracy and democratic socialism are equally valid.'' Smaller rallies were held between the two mass events in the square. Opposition leader <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiss </PERSON> said at one, `` Let us vow to finish the revolution they had begun!'' and the crowd of about 10,000 replied `` We swear! We swear!'' Two weeks ago, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dissolved itself in favor of a successor <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> favoring democratic ideals and multiparty elections. The party issued a statement Friday rejecting the Soviet invasion of 1956.

 Cigarette smokers need more than 1 -LCB- times as much vitamin C a day as non-smokers, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in revising its nutrient intake recommendations for the first time in nearly a decade. `` Smoking seems to increase metabolic turnover of the vitamin, leading to lower concentrations in the blood,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> said in the 10th edition of its Recommended Dietary Allowances. The new guidelines say that non-smokers need 60 milligrams of vitamin C a day and that smokers need at least 100 milligrams. The recommendation for pregnant women who do not smoke is 70 milligrams a day. RDAs are defined as intake levels of essential nutrients that are `` adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all healthy persons.'' People with special nutritional needs are not covered by the RDAs. The recommended allowances for nutrients are amounts intended to be consumed as part of a normal diet; the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> said they `` are neither minimal requirements nor necessarily optimal levels of intake.'' RDAs are used in a number of ways by different groups. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, uses them to evaluate the adequacy of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food supply, for establishing standards for food-assistance programs and for determining the nutritional status of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> popoulation. Most average Americans come in contact most often with nutritional information as it is listed on cereal boxes. Such figures are derived from the RDAs. The new, 285-page volume leaves most previous recommendations unchanged or modifies them only slightly. It does include some important revisions. Instead of basing RDAs for adults on arbitrary heights and weights, allowances now are based on actual heights and weights in the population. Requirements for folate, which is found in liver, leafy vegetables and some fruit, have been reduced from 400 micrograms for both men and women to 240 micrograms for men aged 25 to 50 and 190 micrograms for women of the same ages. The <ORGANIZATION> RDA </ORGANIZATION> for vitamin B-12, an essential nutrient for maintaining normal metabolism and function of the blood-forming organs, was reduced from 3 micrograms for men and women to 2. The new edition lists recommended dietary allowances for protein, 11 vitamins and 7 minerals. It points out that besides known nutrients, food contains thousands of other naturally occurring substances of certain nutritional value. `` A varied diet meeting RDAs,'' said the subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, `` will probably be adequate in all other nutrients.'' The recommendations are not daily objectives, but rather goals to be met over time. `` In planning meals or food supplies,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, `` it is technically difficult and biologically unnecessary to design a single day's diet that contains all the RDAs for all the nutrients.''

 An atmospheric phenomenon called a `` rolling wave'' may have been the cause of the crash of a Honduran airliner that killed 131 people, sources close to the investigation said Monday. They said such a wave, created by a strong wind blowing over mountains, could have caused a severe downdraft that forced the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 jet 1,800 feet below its assigned altitude and into a mountain as it approached <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Toncontin </LOCATION> airport Saturday. A flight attendant and passenger aboard the Honduran airline TAN-SAHSA plane were quoted as saying there had been an explosion aboard the craft. But the sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the investigation was focusing on an atmospheric disturbance as being the cause of the crash. Investigators also were considering the possibility of loss of power in an engine as a cause of the sudden descent, according to the sources. They said reports of severe atmospheric turbulence before the crash would support the theory of a `` rolling wave'' downdraft. Such a wave could be created by wind flowing south over the <PERSON> Cerro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Hule </PERSON> that would follow the contour of the land until running into other mountains, the sources said. The wind would then be pushed up and over, creating a violent downdraft. The phenomenon is similar to wind-shear thunderstorms that have caused crashes near airports in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the sources said. Twelve of the people killed in Saturday's crash were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. There were 15 survivors, including the pilot and co-pilot and three American passengers. Investigators, including teams from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, divided into groups to study evidence. <PERSON> Giomar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizzeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON>, a 28-year-old flight attendant aboard the Honduran jet, said, `` The pilot announced he was going to descend. We were two minutes from the airport ... and I was in my seat with the seatbelt fastened. `` There was an explosion. The emergency door came off toward the inside of the plane, dragging with it a small storage bin where the flight attendants keep our suitcases. Then there was a strong impact.'' Her account was carried by <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribuna </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> newspaper. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Borba </PERSON>, 48, a passenger, told reporters, `` Everything was calm. All of a sudden I saw fire ... and there was an explosion.'' He is an an honorary Paraguayan consul in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. The plane's flight recorders were sent to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to be studied, said <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>, the airline's marketing manager. The plane crashed into a mountain about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> at 7:50 a.m. as it approached the Honduran capital after a flight from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, via <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Tulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Honduran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said the pilot, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON>, reported everything was normal in his last communication with the control tower at 7:45 a.m. He said <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON> radioed the plane was seven miles from the airport at 7,500 feet and on target for an approach to the airport. The pilot, flying on instruments into a 50-mph wind and cloud cover, was supposed to descend to 6,700 feet at the five-mile mark, which is 1,800-feet above the 4,900-foot Cerro de Hule, <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said. `` What happened in those few seconds is what we have to figure out,'' he added. He said <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON> has not been interviewed because of his injuries. Co-pilot <PERSON> Reiniero </PERSON> <PERSON> Canales </PERSON> said in an interview with radio station <ORGANIZATION> HRN </ORGANIZATION> there was nothing unusual about the flight until `` suddenly we hit something. It was all so fast we did n't have time to react.'' People fearing relatives were among the victims continued to gather at the morgue where specialists were trying to identify the bodies. Morgue chief <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said more than 20 bodies have been identified. A Nicaraguan air force plane arrived carrying coffins to take back the bodies of 45 Nicaraguan victims. One of the 67 Nicaraguans aboard survived. Economy Minister <PERSON> Reginaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Panting </PERSON> said TAN-SAHSA had rented the plane for $ 180,000 a month about a year ago from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. He said it was valued at $ 30 million. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the plane was more than 20 years old, with 52,019 cycles _ each a takeoff and landing _ through September and about 65,500 flight hours. He said both figures were average for a plane of that age. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the 727-200 with the most cycles had 66,000 through June. The number of cycles can indicate the stress a plane's fuselage has undergone <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has said consistently its aircraft can remain in service indefinitely if properly maintained. Maj. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguello </PERSON>, Nicaraguan director of civil aeronautics, quoted air controllers as saying the roof of the plane tore away before the crash, but survivors interviewed did not mention that. A 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 737 that lost 18 feet of its upper fuselage over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in April 1988 had 89,680 cycles, among the highest of any 737 in service.

 Space shuttle Atlantis streaked down through the atmosphere and glided safely home Monday after a five-day mission that sent the long-delayed <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft on a 2.4-billion-mile journey to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. Atlantis touched down at 9:32 a.m. in a light breeze, cutting short its mission by two 90-minute orbits to get down before predicted high winds came up on <LOCATION> Rogers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. Before the landing, dense fog had shrouded the base. `` Atlantis, congratulations on an outstanding mission,'' said capsule communicator <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` You've extended the shuttle's reach to the outer planets.'' `` It's nice to be home,'' shuttle commander <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> replied. A relatively modest crowd estimated at about 20,000 was on hand to watch <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, pilot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> come home. `` The vehicle looks amazingly clean. We did not see, with a quick inspection, any significant tile damage _ a little nick here and a nick there,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenoir </PERSON>, an acting associate administrator of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, said at a post-landing news conference. After thanking a crowd of several hundred cheering <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> workers, the astronauts left <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> shortly before 2 p.m. aboard two <LOCATION> Gulfstream </LOCATION> jets bound for their home base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` This is a great beginning for the study of Jupiter,'' <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> said after <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> project manager <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Spehalski </PERSON> teased the astronauts for nicknaming `` our lovely spacecraft ` the Critter.''' `` The Galileo critter is on its way and doing very well,'' <PERSON> Spehalski </PERSON> said. The crew and their spouses returned to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> at about 6:30 p.m. CDT, and they were greeted by their children and nearly 300 friends and co-workers. `` Atlantis was a magnificent ship,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The commander also thanked the workers at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> who helped the crew during their flight. `` We had a great time,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a mission specialist who made her first trip into space aboard Atlantis. `` I'm really proud to be part of the Galileo mission.'' After having most of the day off Tuesday, the astronauts will return to the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to begin a series of briefings about their flight, officials said. The successful deployment of the nuclear-powered <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> accomplished the mission's main goal about 6 -LCB- hours after blastoff Wednesday from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The $ 1.5 billion spacecraft was said to be operating flawlessley, passing the million-mile mark at a speed of nearly 9,000 mph, relative to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, on a looping, 6-year trip to explore Jupiter. Problems in the shuttle program, including the 1986 Challenger explosion, helped delay the start of <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>'s trip by seven years. While a shuttle sent the Magellan orbiter toward <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> in May and will deploy the Ulysses spacecraft to orbit the sun's poles next October, scientists plan to use unmanned rockets to launch subsequent planetary spacecraft. `` We're obviously relieved the shuttle gave us a magnificent ride,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> mission director for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. `` But we're also pleased we're not going to be depending on the space shuttle as the only way into space.'' Several groups unsuccessfully sought to prevent the shuttle launch for fear that an accident could release radioactive fuel into the atmosphere over <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. A federal judge refused to halt the flight. The crew fired Atlantis' big braking rockets to drop out of orbit, and the 97-ton winged spaceship made a fiery descent toward <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, crossing the coast at four times the speed of sound, 105,000 feet over <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>. Automatic control systems put the hurtling orbiter through speed-shedding maneuvers, rocking the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area with the shuttle's signature twin sonic booms. Then <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> lightly set Atlantis on the clay runway where it rolled to a stop on the black-dotted centerline. Reflecting jitters from last week's Bay Quake, the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> got about a dozen calls around 9:30 a.m., said Officer <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>. Nervous callers thought the resonating boom as Atlantis descended was an earthquake or gunshots. The shuttle passed through high winds aloft but surface winds were reported at only about 4 -LCB- mph, with gusts at just under 6 mph moments before touchdown. Fourteen minutes later, controllers told the crew they could remove their bulky flight suits. An astronaut called back, `` Just out of curiosity, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, what's the temperature outside?'' At around 60 degrees, the astronauts were comfortable, exiting the orbiter in their orange flight suits. They inspected the belly of the shuttle, chatting, laughing and hugging each other before leaving the dry lakebed for debriefing. Unofficial elapsed mission time was 4 days, 23 hours and 41 minutes. The astronauts had gone to bed early in anticipation of the early landing and were awakened by a recording of <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s `` Fly Like an Eagle'' beamed up from <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> `` Well I'm not sure we're flying like eagles, but it's been fun so far,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> remarked. If winds were too strong, the landing could have been postponed until Tuesday or Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. The forecast predicted gusts up to 35 mph in the afternoon. Safety rules forbid landings if headwinds reach 29 mph or crosswinds reach 18 mph. The astronauts also conducted several scientific experiments, including one that measured the Earth's protective ozone layer. Two other shuttle experiments involved processing materials and growing corn plants. The astronauts also photographed lightning systems for a weather project and grew ice crystals for a student experiment. Time also was spent photographing various parts of the world with the IMAX movie camera. The footage will be used for a documentary film about <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands have sometimes greeted shuttle returns. Officials attributed the small turnout to the fact that it was a weekday landing. There also were rain showers in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, 80 miles south of <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>, and dense early morning fog around the base.

 Freeway survivor Buck Helm improved Monday but crews searching the collapsed highway where he was rescued gave up hope others would be found alive. The death toll from last week's earthquake climbed by three to 62. Bay area commuters, after conquering heavy morning traffic and rough seas on the first full workday since the quake, faced few afternoon traffic tangles. In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, relief legislation worth $ 2.85 billion moved toward a vote Tuesday. `` We're very certain nobody's up there alive. We've searched, searched, researched, triple-searched,'' said <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wraa </PERSON>, referring to the crumpled 1 \ - mile stretch of Interstate 880 where huge slabs of concrete teetered in Asked if officials had given up hope of finding another survivor, she said, `` That's fair wording.'' With rescue efforts suspended, crews began dismantling a shaky 100-yard section, officials said. <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, whose job is to make the structure was safe for rescuers, called it extremely dangerous. `` Given the right conditions of rain and wind, it could have collapsed,'' he said. Near the freeway, authorities Monday evacuated additional homes after ordering 150 residents of a housing project to leave Sunday because of fears that more of the highway could fall. Thousands have been left homeless by the quake. `` We were all scared,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, who carried a Bible and other books to a middle school where evacuees were being sheltered. There was good news, however, for Helm. He was no longer in pain, his kidney function continued to improve and his condition was upgraded from critical to very serious, Dr. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Huen </PERSON> said. `` We hope that as soon as tomorrow, he will be down to serious,'' <PERSON> Huen </PERSON> said. The 57-year-old longshoreman, who spent four days trapped under the freeway rubble in his <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> before being rescued Saturday, was awake and was given a writing tablet and pencil so he could start responding to questions while on a respirator. His former wife, <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Helm </PERSON>, has read him news accounts of his ordeal and he seems to understand, she said. `` His love for us and our love for him is one of the major things that kept him going,'' Mrs. Helm said at a news conference with other family members. `` He's always been there when I needed him, and this is when he needs us.'' Since their parting, the two have remained good friends, she said. `` We've been divorced for four years and he never gave up. I would say that's a positive attitude.'' Later, stopping at the collapsed freeway, Mrs. Helm exclaimed, `` Oh my God. I do n't see how anyone could make it out alive,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Huth </PERSON>. `` And then she reflected on it a minute and said, ` Well, if anyone could, Buck could.''' Commuters returned to the earthquake-ravaged transit system Monday, many boarding extra trains or a flotilla of ferries because the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> remained closed. The Bay Area Rapid Transit system carried twice the normal load and ferry passengers had to stomach rough seas and whipping winds. `` I've just been through hell, but heck, I have to admit I made it through it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Trowbridge </PERSON>, a commuter who normally would have driven across the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> but instead rode a ferry that lurched constantly, battling swells that washed across the tip of the boat. `` It can only get better, this ca n't get much worse,'' he said. In clear weather during the evening rush hour, few traffic bottlenecks were reported. Damage from Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude quake topped $ 7 billion, surpassing Hurricane Hugo as the costliest natural disaster in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> alone, 750 to 1,000 buildings need extensive repair, Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> told the city-county <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> Monday. He estimated damage in the city at $ 2.2 billion to $ 3.2 billion. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> announced he would call a special legislative session within two weeks to work out the state's response to the devastation Also Monday, the governor fired <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckle </PERSON>, the earthquake expert hired to probe the the I-880 collapse, saying his defense of the state transportation department in an op-ed article jeopardized the inquiry's impartiality. Two more deaths were reported in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and in the beach town of <LOCATION> Bonny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Doon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, workers uncovered the body of 41-year-old man, identified as <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, buried by a landslide during the quake. His car had been found Sunday. One <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> victim, an unidentified woman, was found in fire rubble in the <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district. The other, a 68-year-old woman from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, died of injuries sustained at a downtown hotel. So far, 38 bodies have been pulled from I-880. Dozens remained missing and authorities said they are sure some remain entombed in the freeway. Thousands were injured and homeless from the quake. At a <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> warehouse filled to the rafters with donated supplies, a dozen volunteers Monday prepared goods to be sent to quake victims. Donors continued to bring plastic bags full of clothes, sleeping bags and food to the warehouse, which held items ranging from seltzer water to canned soup. `` People are just very generous,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're very concerned about the needs of other people.'' A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee approved a $ 2.85 billion quake aid package, and the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to act Tuesday. The package is more than the White House supported, but more than $ 1 billion under the request from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> congressional delegation. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the aid could be extended without an increase in the gasoline tax or other new federal taxes. Congressional sources said lawmakers were putting off determining how to pay for the package. `` There is an urgent need for help for people now,'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on transporation and Resources Yet for many in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, a scenic and diverse region of 6 million, life was actually quite normal throughout the past week. Damage was confined to distinct areas of the major cities, although destruction was widespread through <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> towns. And Monday's commute, slow but not paralyzing, underscored how well <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has coped. Dr. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, supervisor of health programs for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, said she was in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> when the quake hit and got mistaken first impressions that the entire city crumpled. `` From watching TV, I got the impression the city was in shambles. In truth, most of the city is functioning very well and back to normal. `` I keep telling my relatives around the country the city is fine except for some very specific areas that did suffer,'' she said. The first phase of the Bay Bridge repair started when workers sawed a 50-foot collapsed section in half and lowered both halves 200 feet by crane Sunday to a barge on wind-whipped <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Without the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, 65,000 rush-hour motorists were forced to seek other ways to work. Daily, 260,000 cars use the bridge, the most crucial of the region's earthquake-disrupted roadways. Repairs will take at least four weeks. About 3 million people commute on a typical workday in the nine-county region. Authorities warned that 2 million of them could be disrupted in a nightmarish obstacle course. Besides I-880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, other freeways were also devastated. The Embarcadero Freeway and the I-280 extension are closed in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Farther south, landslide-clogged Highway 17 is open only to buses and emergency vehicles.

<TEXT>
 The only <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent ever convicted of spying was granted bail Monday, enabling him to go free while he awaits a new trial on charges he passed top-secret <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> information to a Soviet woman who was his lover. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> set bail for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> at $ 337,757, the amount <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s sister, brother and a friend said they could post in property. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> was acting on orders from the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which directed the lower court to set a bond <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> could meet. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who has been in a federal prison in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, since his 1986 conviction, did not attend the brief hearing. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> ordered that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> be brought to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for a hearing next Monday to set a new trial date. It will be <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s third trial His first jury deadlocked before a second jury convicted him in June 1986. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s conviction was reversed in April on grounds that jurors were allowed to hear too much about lie-detector tests <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> took and failed. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>, who had sentenced <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> to two life terms plus 50 years in prison, initially refused to allow <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s release on bail, suggesting that the 52-year-old former agent might flee the country. But the appeals court said there was insufficient evidence that might happen. The corpulent <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who battled the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> over his weight and other problems during a lackluster 20-year career with the agency, was depicted by prosecutors as a bitter, vengeful failure easily recruited as a spy. Defense attorneys said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was a well-meaning <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> misfit who dreamed of redeeming his career by infiltrating a Soviet spy network. Among those who testified against him was codefendant <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, who became his lover and allegedly enticed him into spying. Mrs. <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> and her husband, Nickolay, pleaded guilty to spying and are serving federal prison terms. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> on Monday ordered that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> be released to the custody of former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayers </PERSON>, a private investigator who worked on <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s defense, and that he not leave <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> without special permission.

 Slickered rescue crews, working in a driving rain, on Monday recovered the body of a waiter who had been buried in a beachfront landslide during last week's earthquake. The victim was identified by authorities as <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, 41, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> waiter from <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION>. He had been missing since the quake. His car was located in the <LOCATION> Bonny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Doon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> parking lot about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, authorities said. West's body was found shortly before 2 p.m. Monday, the second day of a search for him along the beach where a cliff gave way and tumbled onto the sand. The National Guard, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> paramedics helped in the search, using a front-end loader to shovel and scoop dirt out of the 90-foot-high cliff. They were assisted by a search dog amed Eros, said Capt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. `` As they were trying to excavate the area, every time they brought out a shovel full of dirt, more dirt was falling in,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. The 30 to 40 rescue workers waded through muck and mud to search the area, struggling to keep the front-end loader upright. The search had to be called off Sunday night at sunset because of high tides and concern that more of the cliff would cave in, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said an autopsy would have to be performed before a cause of death would be available. West, a waiter at the McArthur Park Restaurant in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, was found wearing shorts and buried under 15 feet of rock and dirt, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. No air pockets were found that might have spared <PERSON> West </PERSON>'s life, said forest service Capt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Delagadillo </PERSON>. Residents near the area noticed West's car and contacted authorities. The victim's sister identified the car on Sunday and the search was started.

 Almost one in four American adults would turn over to the police a child of theirs if they caught that child selling cocaine, according to a poll to be published Tuesday. Nearly one in three would turn in their best friend, according to the poll results appearing in Tuesday editions of <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Today. About seven out of eight would turn in a stranger, according to results made available on Monday by the newspaper Here is how the 814 respondents broke down on turning in someone found selling cocaine: own child, 24 percent; best friend, 32 percent; stranger, 86 percent. Only half the respondents said the war against drugs could be won, while 41 percent said it could not. Eighty-eight percent said the drug problem is worse than most people realize. Seventy-one percent said they were worried `` a great deal'' that someone they care about could become a victim of drug-related violence, 58 percent said they feared drug use would result in the ultimate decline of the country and 62 percent said they would be willing to pay higher taxes to fight drugs. On taxes, 53 percent said they would be willing to pay between $ 100 and $ 500 more. The newspaper's announcement did not say how the poll was conducted or when. The likely margin of error is 3.5 percentage points either way.

<TEXT>
 The leftist government Monday threatened to retaliate against U.S.-backed rebels after a series of attacks reportedly killed 20 people during a national voter registration drive. Reacting to the fighting, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> met with top officials from the defense and interior ministries on Sunday, the last of four registration days for the Feb. 25 general elections. In the bloodiest attack, Contra rebels ambushed two trucks carrying military reservists Saturday near <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanco </LOCATION>, about 80 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, military officials said. Eighteen soldiers were reported killed and eight wounded. In a communique Monday, the president's office said, `` Criminal actions such as -LRB- Saturday's -RRB- ... will be punished with all the energy and all the force that the laws of the republic allow for this kind of offense.'' The statement did not say exactly what measures would be taken. In separate remarks, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of creating obstacles to the electoral process. `` They continue opposing demobilization of the Contras in <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> territory, they continue promoting a policy of strangulation against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and maintain financing of the Contra armed mercenaries and now have approved financing of the disarmed mercenaries,'' he said. In February 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military aid to the Contras but it has continued non-lethal support, including $ 49 million approved earlier this year. The latest aid package provides the Contras with food, medicine, shelter, boots and other supplies. It contains a clause, however, that allows the aid to be cut off if the Contras attack within Nicaraguan territory. Most of the rebels are based in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, the top <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> military leader, has denied the accusations by the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government that his troops in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> have been attacking. Instead, he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> that the Sandinista army has been mounting a cleanup operation against the rebels, who `` have to defend themselves.'' The government has claimed the rebels are trying to disrupt the election process. It also says they have gained the support of the Nicaraguan political opposition, which denies the charge. Nicaraguans were allowed to register on the first four Sundays in October. During the first three Sundays, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said 1,336,342 citizens had registered of an estimated total of 1,970,486 eligible voters. A top <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official on an election observer mission said rebel attacks have impaired voter registration and expressed worry that the fighting may increase. `` Regrettably, the electoral process is still marred in some places by the continuing armed actions of some groups,'' <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> told reporters. The former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general is serving as a representative for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. Electoral Council President <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiallos </PERSON> said at least 60 registration places had not opened during the registration period because of actual or threatened Contra attacks. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> called early elections and pledged greater democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in an accord with four other Central American leaders. In exchange, they agreed to dismantling the Contras by Dec. 7, but the rebels say they wo n't disband until the Nicaraguan government guarantees a general amnesty. Sandinista and Contra leaders signed a temporary cease-fire in March 1988. However, they have been unable to reach a permanent peace agreement, and there has been sporadic fighting since then.

 Left-wing rebels ambushed an army convoy on a mountain road Monday and in the battle 13 soldiers and six guerrillas were killed, the military reported. In a separate attack, guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement killed nine peasants who had formed a self-defense group, police said. A brief military report said <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas attacked the army convoy near <LOCATION> Lachoj </LOCATION>, 170 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. One army vehicle was struck by a dynamite bomb during the ambush, it said. The military reported among the soldiers killed were two lieutenants and two sergeants. It gave no further details. Police said Shining Path rebels killed the nine peasants in <LOCATION> Sallalli </LOCATION>, a town 235 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ayachucho </LOCATION> state. Another police report said that on Sunday the Maoist rebels attacked the jail and a government office in <LOCATION> Satipo </LOCATION>, 186 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, killing a local official and one policeman. It said the guerrillas attacked the prison with explosives and gunfire but a special police unit repulsed the assault. The report gave no indication that any prisoners had been freed or escaped. It said <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Ore </PERSON>, 52, the top municipal official, and policeman <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Meza </PERSON>, 23, were killed. Authorities say the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> movement has intensified its attacks in recent weeks in its campaign against municipal elections to be held next month. The government issued a decree Monday declaring a state of emergency in four provinces in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> state. It said the provinces of <LOCATION> Cajatambo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oyon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Barranca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Huaura </PERSON>, about 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, were placed under emergency rule because of the presence of subversives. Under the state of emergency the army is given control of the area and constitutional guarantees are suspended. The Shining Path group began its anti-government campaign in May 1980 and it is estimated more than 15,000 people have been slain in revolt-related violence since then.

 A centuries-old tradition of opium poppy cultivation in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has blossomed into a major heroin industry during a decade of political turmoil in <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. It has spawned what many anxious Pakistanis call a `` heroin and Kalashnikov culture'' of crime, referring to the preferred automatic weapon of the region's drug lords. Most of the brightly colored poppies are grown in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where 11 years of civil war have precluded any attempt to control their cultivation. Officials say the flowers' sticky yield of opium is refined into heroin powder in makeshift laboratories along the rugged Pakistan-Afghan frontier.

 When <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ultimo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fila </ORGANIZATION> goes on stage, rock singer <PERSON> Manolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> strikes the pose of a matador, flamenco dancers swirl and stamp to the sound of electric guitars and screaming fans surge forward. Although lead guitarist <PERSON> Quimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Portet </PERSON> says the group plays rock music, the back-up acoustic guitar, castanets and wailing vocals that have become its trademark are unmistakably and traditionally Spanish. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is synonomous with music, but only recently has home-grown rock' n' roll moved to center stage as the country witnessed explosive growth in bands, concerts and record companies in the past decade. When <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and the Beatles hit the music scene, Spaniards were living under a military dictatorship. But the death of authoritarian ruler Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> in 1975 and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s transition to democracy provided the cultural and political context within which local rock could flourish. Rock bands soon became blatantly ideological in their lyrics and entertained at political rallies and municipal gatherings as the music became a banner for a cultural and political reawakening known as the `` movida'' _ the happening. `` I do n't think what happened was a cultural renaissance, or anything like that,'' said rock singer <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reixa </PERSON>, `` What happened is that people all of a sudden returned to the way they had always been. Madrid of the ` movida' of the early'80s was like the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Arniches </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> of the ` zarzuelas,' but with spiked hair and pop music.'' -LRB- <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Arniches </PERSON> was an early 20th-century composer who wrote for music halls; zarzuelas are operettas based on popular themes. -RRB- Early Spanish rock was little more than an imitation of British and American music, but musicians gradually began to experiment, fusing rock with traditional styles. This experimentation led to the birth of flamenco-rock. Such Groups as Triana -LRB- a neighborhood in <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> -RRB-, were a precursor to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ultimo </LOCATION> -LRB- the last in line -RRB-. `` Triana'' excited listeners in the late'70s with their mixture of rock and Gypsy-inspired Andalusian folklore. The legalization of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s regional languages following the return to democracy opened the way for groups such as Os Resentidos -LRB- the Resentful -RRB-, a band from <LOCATION> Galicia </LOCATION> that mixes raunchy, distorted sounds of electric guitar and synthesizers with bagpipe music typical of <ORGANIZATION> Celtic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galicia </ORGANIZATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The group, which started in 1982, played one of its first gigs in a psychiatric hospital. It now has its own music videos and continues to occupy alternative music charts with a bagpipe-rap version of its hit `` <LOCATION> Galicia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sitio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Distinto </LOCATION>'' -LRB- `` <LOCATION> Galicia </LOCATION>, a Different Kind of Place'' -RRB-. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s rock movement has been especially active in the small northern provinces of the restive Basque country, home to some of the most radical rock and punk groups. Basque separatism and political activism have spawned bands such as the Basque-language Kortatu, with its highly politicized mixture of rock, reggae, punk and occasional Basque accordion riffs. `` There are many more bands now than at the beginning of the'80s,'' said <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> disc jockey <PERSON> Chusma </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` But now there is no sense of direction.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> says many radical groups, Basque and otherwise, still exist, but they are being overshadowed by a new generation of apolitical bands that opt for a variety of styles. Aficionados of punk, new wave, heavy metal and rockabilly, each in the appropriate attire, roam the streets of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and the plazas of small Castilian villages. American-style country music also has made an considerable impression on Spanish bands. `` I ` m really bothered by so much music with American country references,'' said <PERSON> Reixa </PERSON>. `` There ca n't be country in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. I'm fed up with songs that talk about Cadillacs and bourbon. <PERSON> Manolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ultimo </ORGANIZATION> says the group will not go American in order to expand its market. Despite this uncompromising approach and an aversion to marketing blitzes, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Ultimo </PERSON> performs before sell-out crowds in the country of 39.8 million and boasts record sales in the hundreds of thousands. Their latest LP, `` <ORGANIZATION> Como </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabeza </ORGANIZATION> al Sombrero,'' recorded with DPI, a small, independent company, has been released in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and will soon be distributed in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>. But Spanish rock has not had much success abroad. `` Los Bravos'' topped the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charts in the early'60s with their English-language `` Black Is Black,'' but little else has gone beyond the Spanish market since. Several Spanish pop groups have begun to look toward <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as a logical source of fans and record sales, but few have made it big. `` The exchange with <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is minimal,'' said <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> disc jockey <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, `` Spanish independent companies are simply incapable of exporting music in large quantities to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' where audiences tend to prefer ballad singers such as <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> or more traditional styles. But the technopop group `` Mecano'' is an exception to the rule with more than 1 million records sold from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fuego </LOCATION>. Both `` Mecano'' and `` Hombres G'' are among the few <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> groups picked up by multinational recording companies. `` El Ultimo'' is just breaking ground in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Portet </LOCATION> took their low-key promotional rock tour to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in July. `` Here in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> we were considered a weird group when we started, and in certain respects we still are over there,'' said <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. `` The process taking place there is similar to what happened here four or five years ago _ one of surprise and then, little by little, gradually acceptance.'' In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Portet </PERSON> said, the organizers tried to sell them as a Hispanic group. `` That's fine, but we make music for people, not for specific groups.'' Although <PERSON> Os </PERSON> <PERSON> Resentidos </PERSON> have made it in their native <LOCATION> Galicia </LOCATION> and on alternative lists in the rest of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, their first album was put out in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Galego </PERSON> and Portuguese are more similar than <PERSON> Galego </PERSON> and Spanish. <PERSON> Reixa </PERSON> is not optimistic about success in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` They know us a little in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, but inflation is so high there and with the economic crisis it's impossible to sell records, to play, to do anything. And in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, they're almost on the verge of a civil war. `` What cracks me up is that we're most popular in places where there's a lot of turmoil.''

<HEAD>Venezuelan Shark Fishermen Accused of Using Dolphins as Bait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Environmentalist groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> Venezuelan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, charge that fishermen are killing dolphins for bait to catch sharks. One group, <PERSON> Fundatropicos </PERSON>, claims that the shark fishermen are harpooning thousands of dolphins a year to hook small sharks used in a favorite Venezuelan delicacy called `` cazon.'' Some fishermen and government officials deny the charges, but the allegations have touched off a heated debate among enviromentalists in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The result has been conflicting press reports, confusion over the number of dolphins killed, uncertainty about which fishermen might be responsible, a call for a boycott of shark meat and an open rivalry between two government ministries. `` Between 6,000 and 7,000 dolphins per year are killed by shark fishermen using a system called trotline fishing,'' says <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Szeplaki </PERSON>, a biologist who is spearheading a campaign by <PERSON> Fundatropicos </PERSON>. A trotline is a long fishing line with hundreds of baited hooks attached to it. In July, the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> identified 12 fishing boats thought to be killing dolphins and the areas where the killings were taking place. According to <PERSON> Szeplaki </PERSON>, Venezuelan fishermen got the idea of using dolphins as shark bait from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The dolphin meat is fibrous, lasts as long as three days and is regarded as effective in attracting sharks. Killing dolphins, while prohibited by Venezuelan law, also enables fishermen to avoid having to buy bait. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Novoa </PERSON>, director of the fishing section at the <ORGANIZATION> Venezuelan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, describes <PERSON> Fundatropicos </PERSON>' accusations as `` completely without foundation.'' He says nine Korean boats operating in Venezuelan waters may have killed dolphins but departed more than a year and a half ago. According to <PERSON> Novoa </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> now has only four trotline shark boats, despite <PERSON> Fundatropicos </PERSON>' claim of 17. While acknowledging the possibility of `` isolated cases'' of dolphin killings, <PERSON> Novoa </PERSON> said captains of shark boats deny it. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohir </PERSON>, director of an <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> animal protection agency, disagreed with <PERSON> Novoa </PERSON>. `` I am far more realistic,'' he said. `` Yes, there are irregularities.'' In <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> is charged with marketing and developing ocean resources and the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> oversees their protection and conservation. `` At times the marketing part takes precedence over protection,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, an engineer at the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` There must be greater communication and team work.'' Dolphins are protected by international accords in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, where dolphins and tuna swim together and dolphins suffocate in tuna fishermen's nets. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, which sends tuna fleets into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, met the terms of those accords last year after a 38-day tuna embargo by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But no such accords apply to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, which makes up <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s shoreline, and the shark fishermen, who are just 1 percent of the nation's fishing fleet. But <PERSON> Szeplaki </PERSON> maintains that nearly half of all species of dolphin can be found in Venezuelan waters and that some species might be in danger of extinction. Despite the accusations of dolphin killings in the press and official circles, only one trotline shark boat has been sanctioned so far. The Environment and Agriculture ministries said that occurred in 1988 when the boat was found to have eight dead dolphins aboard. It was fined 30,000 bolivars, less than $ 1,000. New legislation under consideration in the Venezuelan <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would increase penalties for killing marine mammals but would do little to upgrade enforcement. However, the recent flurry of accusations has prompted <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s attorney general to open an investigation. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Szeplaki </PERSON> and others are asking Venezuelans to boycott shark meat.

 Author <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Charteris </PERSON> was skeptical when <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON>, the 12th actor to play <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Templar </PERSON> in `` The Saint,'' told him his mother had named him for the famous semicrooked detective. <PERSON> Charteris </PERSON>, who wrote the best-selling novels about the dashing character, asked <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> whether he actually had been named for the character or if he'd made it up `` for the newspapers,'' the actor said. `` When I assured him my mother was a fan he invited her to his 81st birthday party in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' `` The Saint'' that <PERSON> Charteris </PERSON> created is a swashbuckler of dubious morality, a `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> of crime'' dedicated to justice. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who played him on TV from 1967 to 1969, is perhaps the best-remembered of those who have tackled the role. <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON>'s version is part of the syndicated `` Mystery Wheel of Adventure.'' Six two-hour movies of original `` Saint'' mysteries are among the 10 shows being telecast by 102 stations. Since `` The Saint'' sought adventure all over the world, the six new TV movies about him were filmed on location in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. All the stories are original. <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> met <PERSON> Charteris </PERSON> during a visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Charteris </PERSON>, born <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Yin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> of a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> father and an English mother, is an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen who lives in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. His mysterious, urbane adventurer made his first appearance in `` Enter the Saint'' in 1930, the first of 45 novels. `` The Saint'' also has appeared in movies, television, radio and comic strips. When interviewed, <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON>, whose thick black hair is turning gray at the temples, was just back from filming the final movie in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. He stopped here en route to his home in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Templar </PERSON> is really an adventure seeker,'' he said. `` He becomes involved in the crimes in various ways. Maybe a friend gets in trouble. He smells out danger and intrigue. He works both sides of the law under various aliases. He's very much a product of English public schools. His clothes are from Saville Row. `` He's from a wealthy, aristocratic family but probably from the wrong side of the sheets. He's not a playboy. He makes his living as a jewel thief. <PERSON> Charteris </PERSON> was very much influenced by <PERSON> Raffles </PERSON>, the gentleman burglar. The heavies in the novels were based on real people <PERSON> Charteris </PERSON> met in his travels.'' The British actor, 31, has been on American television before. He starred in a CBS movie based on <PERSON> Agatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s `` Man in a Brown Suit.'' He also was in the British miniseries, `` By the Sword Divided,'' a story of the English civil war. That show was televised in this country. <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON>, who also played <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gere </PERSON>'s brother in the movie, `` King <PERSON> David </PERSON>,'' grew up in and around <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and attended the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speech </ORGANIZATION> and Drama. `` I started in repertory theater and my break came when I was cast in ` Another Country' in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> saw the play and cast me in his film ` Memed My Hawk,' based on a Turkish folk story about a <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> type character. `` We never stopped laughing during the production. One actor cracked a rib and begged <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> to stop telling stories because it hurt to laugh. We'd come in every day and ask <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> to imitate a new musical instrument. He never missed.'' `` The Mystery Wheel of Adventure'' in which <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> appears also consists of three adaptations of books by <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> and one offbeat mystery called `` Star Trap.'' `` The Saint'' has been played on radio by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Aherne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrier </PERSON>.

 Construction workers carving out a road for an elite <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> resort bulldozed their way into an ancient world under a blanket of seaside sand. They had stumbled upon a city more than 2,000 years old and stretching for more than a mile along <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s coastline 125 miles west of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>. `` It's unbelievable,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, who controls <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> operations in the region. `` Other countries get excited about finding an ancient house. We have a whole city. It's without equal in all of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.'' The bulldozers were stopped a month after the ruins were discovered in 1985. By that time, a road had been sliced through what appears to have been an ancient temple, but much more remained. A few months later, Egyptian and Polish archaeologists began excavating the ruins, without letting word out, and what they've found over the last three years is in remarkable condition `` What we have in hand is a golden egg, undisturbed, a complete city that changed with time,'' said <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, director general of Pharaonic monuments. `` It's not only a city of the dead, but also a city of the living, side by side. It's something very rare and very important.'' The city, believed to have been founded in the second century B.C., lasted more than 500 years. As excavators intruded on its serenity since 1986, antiquities officials have worked quietly in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to save the site from further destruction. The still-unidentified city now peeks in and out of its sandy grave. To one side stands a row of ultramodern apartments built along the coastline by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION>. A new apartment complex was to have been erected on top of what turned out to be the ruins. `` The site is under our protection,'' said <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON>, chairman of the antiquities organization. `` Nothing can happen to it now.'' Only a small area has been excavated, but archaeologists already have discovered well-preserved houses, vast cemeteries with decorated and undecorated tombs, catacombs, a bath, a basilica and many artifacts, imported and local, including statues and frescoes. Egyptian excavators are now at work. In February they'll be rejoined by 10 Polish archaeologists and restorers to make detailed surveys of the site and its needs. They already have restored critical pieces that had begun to disintegrate since the bulldozing of the road. Walking through the excavations, <PERSON> Feisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashmy </PERSON>, the antiquities inspector in charge of the ancient city, pointed toward mounds of toppled marble columns. They lay at the beside a ditch cut 35 feet wide and 10 feet deep by the grading equipment. `` Before the bulldozers got here, this was a temple, I think. It's terrible, but we now have to focus on saving what's left,'' he said. `` There's so much. All you have to do is to look down, and history says, ` Take me.''' Early historians recorded a number of small coastal cities along <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coastline. Villages of white houses, fishing boats and nets, and later the domes of early Christian churches, dotted the landscape. Vineyards, olive groves, fruit trees and almonds were plentiful. Families on outings sailed to outlying islands to drink wine. W.A. <PERSON> Daszewski </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institite </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and an expert in the Greco-Roman period, said he's delighted with the find. `` This is a great opportunity for us to see how it was. It's a unique chance to understand the quality of housing during this period,'' he said in an interview. `` This was a landowners' city. ... They probably had farms inland, but residents preferred to have their houses along the coast because of the cooler climate.'' Excavated houses are large, with complex systems that carried rainwater from the roof to basement cisterns. Some are elaborately decorated with pillars, niches, statues and delicate frescoes. `` The architectural decoration in the city is first class and well-preserved,'' <PERSON> Daszewski </PERSON> said. Designs on tombs range from simple pits through small step pyramids to magnificent, multistoried funerary complexes. <PERSON> Daszewski </PERSON> said burials date from the second century B.C. to the end of the third century A.D., but he believes the city existed in some form until the early seventh century. <PERSON> Daszewski </PERSON> said he knows of two possible names for the city: <LOCATION> Leucaspis </LOCATION> _ white shield _ which would refer to a sandspit that protected the harbor; and Antiphre or <LOCATION> Antiphra </LOCATION>, a city mentioned as late as the fourth century A.D. because of a bishop who hailed from there. `` Both are possibilities, but we have a basilica here, so the city existed during early Christian times,'' <PERSON> Daszewski </PERSON> said. `` I rather think it's Antiphre, but it's possible the city was called one thing, the harbor area another. We do n't know.'' The Polish and Egyptian archaeologists predict it'll be years before excavation and restoration is completed. `` Maybe 10, maybe 15, maybe more,'' said antiquities official <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>.

He hopes to frighten middle-class voters away from <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a moderate Christian Democrat heavily favored in most opinion polls to win the Dec. 14 election to replace Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the president since the military took power in 1973. The opposition confidently predicts the failure, however, of <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>'s aggressive tack. `` It's a crass error,'' <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Huneeus </PERSON>, a pollster working with the <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> campaign, said in an interview. `` It has nothing to do with reality in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was forced to call elections after Chileans, in a yes-or-no ballot last year, rejected a proposal that he remain leader until 1997. He is scheduled to hand power over to the new president in March. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> led a coalition of centrist and leftist parties that campaigned for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s defeat in the referendum and is now its sole presidential candidate. <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, 40, was <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s finance minister for four years until March and is backed by rightist political groups. A third candidate is a populist banker-businessman, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON>. In the first days of the campaign, after the candidates registered in July, <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> stressed his achievements as finance minister. They include steady economic growth and low inflation, in sharp contrast to other Latin American countries. But the message apparently has won him few backers. Polls in early October indicated he is trailing <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> by as much as 30 percentage points. It was then he went on the attack. He charged that <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> has a `` secret pact'' with leftists who had been prominent in the turbulent government of President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, the Marxist who was elected to office in 1970. Further, <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> claimed, the leftists are likely to again plunge <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> into the economic and social chaos that marked the Allende years and prompted the 1973 coup. He blamed <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>'s supporters for beating <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> backers and bombing some campaign offices. In a televised debate with <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> Oct. 9, <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> hinted that his opponent's backers might be responsible for the hit-and-run death of a pro-Buchi labor activist. But a police investigation later determined that he was killed in an ordinary traffic accident. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a 70-year-old veteran statesman, has responded by emphasizing his own reputation as a moderate and accuses <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> of waging an undignified and irresponsible `` scare campaign.'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>'s principal campaign message has been the need for national unity to assure a democratic transition. But <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>'s backers contend that the <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> camp is guilty of below-the-belt politics. `` They are trying to define the Dec. 14 election as a choice between dictatorship and democracy, which is a lie,'' said <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraona </PERSON> `` It is not dictatorship or democracy that is at stake here. It is two democratic platforms.'' <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> has tried to distance himself from <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, even recommending publicly that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> give up his command of the army when the change in government takes place. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has said he plans to remain on as commander, a post that the country's 1980 constitution allows him to keep for eight more years.

<HEAD>Shooting Radicalizes Victim, Wife on Gun Control Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The AK-47 bullets that blasted away his left knee and right elbow also ended <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>'s comfortable detachment from the struggle over gun control. `` I've never been much of an activist,'' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, one of a dozen survivors of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s rampage at the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> printing plant. `` Obviously I am for gun control now.'' The ability of a mentally ill man bent on revenge to legally buy a military-style, semi-automatic rifle has made his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, even more partisan. She has special contempt for legislators she sees as complicitous to the extent they permit traffic in such guns and for people who think `` that their right to carry a gun supersedes my husband's right to carry his grandson.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is strong in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, where the hunting is good and freedom of arms is cherished. But fallout from the Sept. 14 <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION> shootings, in which eight people died, may put the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> on the defensive for the first time in memory when the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> convenes in January. Mrs. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> looks toward the session and the likelihood of legislation to ban or limit the sale of `` assault'' weapons. `` I am not a public speaker but I will support, in any way I can, legislation to ban those kinds of weapons.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, which regularly fights such legislation as an infringement on the Second Amendment right of citizens to `` keep and bear arms,'' will be ready. The organization says that nothing _ not a waiting period, not a ban on specific weapons _ would have prevented <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s mission of vengeance against the company that ended his job because of his mental illness. `` I think what's the real tragedy is that we use incidents like this to propose restrictions on law-abiding citizens that will have no effect on incidents in the future,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist. `` How in a free society do you keep people like that man from acquiring a firearm? I do n't know what the answer is to that,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. A number of state officials now say they have an answer: restrictions on assault weapons. Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, long an opponent of gun control, endorsed assault-weapon restrictions in the days after the massacre. Two state lawmakers from the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> area said they are ready to sponsor the legislation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, a conservative <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> ally, agreed four days after the shootings to become a co-sponsor of legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would ban the domestic manufacture of assault weapons. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, 47, had an abundance of demons: two broken marriages and a belief he had been injured by workplace chemicals and wronged by <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION>, which prints newspaper supplements and advertising inserts. He had been placed on permanent disability leave because of mental illness in 1988. It was shortly before a morning shift change when he returned to the plant to say a gruesome good-bye. Besides the AK-47, which can shoot 40 bullets a minute, <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> had two MAC-11 semi-automatic machine pistols, a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, a .38 - caliber revolver, a bayonet and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, according to He carried the AK-47, the SIG-Sauer 9mm and extra ammo. The rest was stashed in a gym bag under a stairwell. Police said <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, having shot 20 people, apparently was heading for the arms cache when he stopped, put the pistol under his chin and squeezed the trigger. His shots killed eight others. Among the survivors, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a tennis player who at 51 could easily pass for 40, was luckier than most, though grievously wounded in both arms and both legs. His left knee was pulverized. As the couple's five daughters arrived one by one at the hospital, and collapsed one by one in horror, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>'s fury welled. `` I promised myself: ` I am going to do something about this.''' A day later, she faced reporters and television cameras for the first time, eldest daughter <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> in tears beside her, and bristled. `` You see the devastation?'' she said. `` And anybody who thinks a private citizen needs an assault gun, please justify it to this child, to my husband and to his grandchild. You will not justify it to me.'' After 13 days in the hospital, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> went home to the house he and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> have rehabilitated over 10 years. A hospital bed awaited in the living room, as did an electric wheelchair and a new cordless telephone. Doctors say the best <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> can hope for is to walk with a cane within the next three years. Then, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> said, doctors will assess the amount of regrowth to bones in his knee; if there is enough he might be a candidate for an operation that would allow him to walk nearly normally. For now, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> will be able to sit in the gazebo, his favorite place, and watch the falling leaves of autumn, his favorite time of year. She will be watching the legislature.

 <LOCATION> SHAWL-I-COURT </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ For <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON>, the decade-long civil war is over and his six-year odyssey in exile finished. The arid plains of southern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are quiet again, the sound of warplanes and exploding artillery shells replaced by the rustle of the hot desert wind through the grapevines. Atop the shattered mud villages, above the tents pitched by nomads and in the fields where camels graze, the black and white and red and green flags of the Moslem resistance flutter in the breeze. An undeclared truce exists between the soldiers defending the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the mujahedeen guerrillas who rule the countryside around <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s second largest city and the cradle of its now-deposed monarchy. Despite the uncertainty of its durability, the peace is luring thousands of refugees like <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> home. `` I could have stayed in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> where I know my family would be safe,'' said <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON>. `` But believe me, I love this destroyed country a thousand times more. I could never be happy anywhere else.'' In August 1983, Soviet tanks rumbled into <PERSON> Shawl-i-Court </PERSON> and unleashed a fierce barrage lasting nearly 30 hours to rout suspected guerrillas hiding inside the mud-walled compound. <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON>, his family and a few of the other 1,000 families who survived the barrage fled 120 miles to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where they lived with 170,000 other refugees in a camp near the desert town of <LOCATION> Chaman </LOCATION>. Nearly 6 million Afghans are living in refugee camps in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the bases of the resistance groups trying to overthrow the government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. Most Afghan refugees are anxious to return to a country where war has been raging for 11 years. Even though the struggle shows no apparent signs of ending, some like <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> have become impatient at the lack of military victory or negotiated settlement and are going home. International relief agencies and government officials estimate about 100,000 Afghans have returned since the Soviet troops left in February. But they acknowledge they can not accurately gauge the flow because of the country's porous borders and lack of any central authority. `` I was born here,'' said <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON>, a 33-year-old farmer, finally back home. `` My father and grandfather were born here. This is home and I want it to be my children's home. Why should n't we come back? The Soviets are gone and God willing, peace will come soon.'' It was before dawn when <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON>, his wife and their two children, his father, aunt, uncle and three cousins packed their belongings and piled into a battered blue pickup truck, said goodbye to those staying behind at the <LOCATION> Chaman </LOCATION> camp and headed for the border. <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> seemed apprehensive at first, wondering whether <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> border guards would force them to turn back or demand steep prices he could not pay. When the border guards waved them by and they plowed through the sandy plain, the excitement on <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON>'s wizened face became as infectious as a child's joy on Christmas morning. `` This is really <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. One day we'll all be back,'' he said as the group headed toward Spin Buldak, the border post captured by the guerrillas in November. `` Welcome to Free Aghanistan.'' The sign was spray-painted on the side of a building on which a white flag had been planted. Beyond lay the remains of a once-bustling tourist information center, a crumbling reminder of the Western hippy trail of the early 1970s. A few guerrillas, their rifles strapped over their shoulders, sat by a campfire in the center of the shattered buildings and captured Soviet tanks. As <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> and his family chugged down the road, weaving from side to side to avoid the huge potholes left by years of neglect, his thoughts frequently turned to his two sons, among the 700,000 Afghan children born in exile. `` All their lives they have seen mujahedeen coming in and out of the house and they have idealized <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` For them, this is supposed to be the most beautiful country in the world. I fear they may hate me for the deception.'' Along the road cutting across what was once one of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s most densely populated provinces, there is now only destruction and the tattered flags marking the graves of some of the 1.5 million Afghans who have died in the struggle against the Marxist government that seized power in April 1978 They passed through a guerrilla checkpoint and then turned down a narrow dirt path, bouncing along the rocky, barren terrain, weaving between the ox carts, the <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rovers </ORGANIZATION> and huge trucks with their cargoes concealed under burlap covers. They reached another potholed road lined with burned and rusting shells of more than 100 Soviet tanks, armored personnel carriers and rocket launchers. The destruction along the road was startling _ a huge silo built by the Soviet lay in ruins and houses and buildings lay in ruins. And in the midst of vast destruction, the blue-domed masoleum of an Afghan king stood unscratched. Then, the 10-hour journey was over; they were home and it was mealtime. The family sat cross-legged in the ruined house of an old friend and guerrilla commander. All ate from the same plates _ their first meal in `` Free Afghanistan.''

 After 40 years of Communist rule, much has changed inside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Much remains the same.

<DATELINE>PEACEFUL VILLAGE, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The road to <LOCATION> Peaceful </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> is a ribbon of brown powder winding among the pale and dusty cliffs of dry, northwestern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The earth crumbles to the touch and seems to have no nourishment in it. But nine generations of the Xu, <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> clans that comprise Peaceful have coaxed from it spare harvests of wheat and beans. Asked to tell stories about the village, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunbao </PERSON>, 65, talks about water. He tells how his ancestors walked 12 miles each day to reach the nearest well, how a new well dug when he was a child turned out to be too salty to drink. Less than 12 inches of rain falls in a good year. It is too dry even for crickets: The hills at night are eerily silent. The great drought of 1929 forced <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s family to move to a city where, ironically, they made a living as water sellers. But after three years, when the drought eased, they and other fugitives from the village returned. Why? `` Our forefathers lived here, we were born here,'' explains <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s 70-year-old brother, <PERSON> Yunnian </PERSON> The stubborn loyalty of generations of Chinese peasants to their ancestral homes has helped the Communist government for most of its 40 years of rule to keep country and city sharply separated, preventing the development of peasant shantytowns around cities, like elsewhere in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The separation also kept the relative wealth of the cities from filtering down to the villages, leaving many peasants without electricity or adequate water supplies well into the 1970s. Some villages still go without, while modern appliances such as washing machines have become standard in urban homes. For most peasants, the mechanics of daily life remained unchanged even while the Communists first collectivized and then redistributed the land, closed temples, set up clinics and schools and made other radical changes in the social and political fabric of village life. But in the past few years the rural-urban barriers have begun to crumble. An economic boom generated by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s embrace of the free market created millions of construction jobs in cities, and young men flocked from the countryside to fill them. Even more important, a bit of the city came to the countryside in the form of small rural factories that by this year employed a total of 95 million peasants, nearly a quarter of the rural work force. For the first time, the peasants' ancient dependence on the whimsies of weather was broken. The late revolutionary leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>, a product of a peasant family, said peasants should grow grain. Any other endeavor, he said, was capitalistic. But under <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s more flexible rule, the Peaceful Village committee took out a loan and set up a brick factory in 1985. Profits from that helped set up a calcium carbide factory, and the two jointly have underwritten a new village-owned poultry and pig farm and new primary and middle schools. Other villages have used the profits from similar factories to build irrigation ditches, pave streets, install electricity and open small stores in the first significant infusion of investment funds the Chinese countryside has ever seen. Nearly one-fifth of Peaceful's 500 families have a member working in one of the factories or on the poultry farm, bolstering family income with a guaranteed monthly wage of about $ 32, more than double the per capita earnings from the land and close to the average monthly salary for urban workers. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s open policies also included accepting outside help, such as a $ 55 million World Food Program grant that helped build pipes and pumps to carry water from the <LOCATION> Yellow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, 16 miles away. The Chinese government contributed $ 222 million. Since the project was finished last year, a network of ditches brings river water to nearly half the fields in Peaceful and other villages in the region, and families can draw water from cisterns a few yards from their homes.

 `` Things are pretty good here now,'' says 35-year-old <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhengqie </PERSON>, squatting alongside a dirt path with a few of his neighbors, watching another man driving a tractor over newly harvested wheat to thresh it. They smoke and chat in the morning sun, waiting their turn. <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> says his acre and a half yielded enough wheat to feed his family of four. But less rides on the harvest now. He earns a steady $ 270 a year driving a jeep for the local government. Like most of his neighbors, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> is saving up to build a new house, bigger than the three rooms of clay brick he has now. He has already helped set another trend by replacing his traditional kang, a heated sleeping platform for the whole family, with a Western-style bed. `` It's more modern,'' he says proudly. `` We slowly learn from the cities.'' But the rural mini-boom _ no more than five years old in most villages _ may be coming to an end. A yearlong clampdown on construction, intended to curb nationwide inflation of more than 25 percent, has sent millions of peasants home from the cities. Thousands of rural factories have been forced to close because they take raw materials and energy needed by the behemoth state companies. Many rural companies consistently out-perform the state businesses in productivity, but the conservative leaders who won June's power struggle in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> say state factories must get priority as a pillar of the socialist system. Rural factories rank lower ideologically: They are owned by village or township governments or by individuals and operate outside the state-planned economy. The leaders acknowledge the new policies will hurt rural residents but have offered no solutions. Officials in <LOCATION> Gansu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, where Peaceful is located, insisted they had no figures for the number of <LOCATION> Gansu </LOCATION> peasants put out of work. Officially there is no such thing as rural unemployment: Everyone is considered to work on the land. Despite rapid growth _ rural industrial output has grown more than 30 percent a year since 1985 _ village factories have only begun to shrink the huge gap between rural and city life. If this growth slows markedly or reverses, life in Peaceful will remain more in the 19th century than the 20th. Only the new cisterns and the television sets in many homes would greatly startle any long-gone ancestor who paid a visit. Even the new houses, with shiny red doors and black tile gates, use paper for windows and coal cooking stoves for heat. Life remains a round of chores to be tackled with a strong arm and back. A cart loaded with produce is as likely to be pushed by two peasants as pulled by a mule or tractor. <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> and his neighbors gathered their harvest by hand, and although a tractor helped with the threshing, they used rakes to separate the grain and chaff. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuhua </PERSON>, a soft-spoken woman who came to Peaceful 23 years ago as a teen-age bride, was asked how she spends her free time. `` I cut grass for the pigs,'' she said. A large picture of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> general <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> decorates </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s home, but she only giggles uncomfortably when asked if this means she thinks <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> was a great leader. Questions about politics and ideology fall flat in Peaceful: People look to results and are content as long as the economy prospers. `` We ca n't leap ahead, we will have to remain backward for a while,'' says <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON>, vice magistrate of <LOCATION> Gaolan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, which includes Peaceful, professing support for the central government's clampdown on economic growth But <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON> is confident the clampdown will bypass Peaceful and all of <LOCATION> Gaolan </LOCATION>. `` We did n't develop factories blindly,'' he says. `` We've tried to emphasize products that were needed.'' When <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> talks about over-heated investment, he adds, `` They're certainly not talking about us.'' Rural officials elsewhere expressed similar hopes: that their factories would be considered too useful, too profitable or too innocuous to warrant closure. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is very big so it's not possible to act quickly,'' one government worker said. `` Sometimes the old policy has not been carried out and there's a new one.

 It was just after the Lunar New Year last February that an army of up to 2.5 million peasants rode the rails to this city in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in search of fortune. The crush came after migrant laborers working in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and the surrounding <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> delta returned home for the holiday and told fellow villagers of the high wages at the region's toy, textile and garment factories. Most of the peasants quickly returned home because the region could not absorb such a sudden and massive influx of unskilled labor. But smaller waves have continued to pour into the delta. On the 40th anniversary of Communist rule, this coastal region of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province is indeed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s land of plenty. Lush green rice paddies, orchards and rolling hills spread from the meandering <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.

 A nearly forgotten program of World War II, called V-12, turned out 60,000 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> officers _ and changed their lives.

 The meatloaf on the metal mess trays had the taste and the look of old times for the aging men in gold-emblazoned <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> blue baseball caps. The gold read: <ORGANIZATION> NAVY </ORGANIZATION> V-12. And as they chowed down on <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bean soup, meatloaf, steamed carrots, mashed potatoes, fruit salad and lots of coffee, they laughed and needled and talked about V-12. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> V-12? Hardly anybody remembers it except the men who were in it and the families who have endured stories about it. Now these men were here on a mild fall weekend to celebrate what V-12 had meant to them and to the country. They called the meeting the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> V-12 National Colloquium, a fancy name for organized talk. The talk was plain and not always organized. If all the talk had been condensed into a theme, it might have been: V-12 was the turning point in my life. V-12 gave boys who grew up in the Depression a chance at college. It furnished officers for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. It trained leaders for the future. It kept small schools alive. All that happened because the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> saw that the World War II draft was devouring potential officer material, and it looked like a long war. So with President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s blessing, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> created V-12, a program to put college men in uniform and get them ready for midshipmen's schools and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer candidates school. When the program ended, it had produced more than 60,000 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> officers. Many of its trainees went on to become prominent: Former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader and former White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, former Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>, former Commissioner of Baseball <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON>, Heisman Trophy winner <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertelli </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION> Coach <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, actors <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, `` Tonight Show'' host <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>. Invitations to the national colloquium, the first since the program began 46 years ago, went to about 17,000 known V-12s. Their names had been tracked down for a history of V-12 by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan and a V-12 at <ORGANIZATION> Milligan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Landers </PERSON> ran a letter from <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> about the colloquium, and her column produced about 2,000 replies. About 260 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> men and 20 Marines turned out. Wives were there, too, about 100 of them. That was enough to dominate a luxury hotel, filling the bars, the elevators, the dining rooms, the meeting room and the banquet room with blue and gold caps. Only one of the big names showed. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> had been scheduled on the program. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> had been invited to be on it. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> pleaded intervening business. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> wrote that `` the tremendous constraints on my time'' prevented him from coming. `` That's joke No. 1,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackes </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, introducing a humor session. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> found time to drop by the mess tray lunch with a wave for his old compadres. But big names hardly mattered. The men were here to see old friends and make new ones and, mainly, to talk about old times. Some asked why so comparatively few had registered. `` As usual, the Marines were just looking for a few good men,'' said an old Marine. And the organizers said after all, this was a first, and it's hard to get the word out to that many men People move, addresses change. And there was the cost of four days in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Some wrote from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> that if the colloquium had been in the middle of the country _ say, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ they would have made it. `` Yes, it's expensive,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> veteran <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClory </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, `` but it may also be the chance of a lifetime.'' That lifetime for V-12s began on July 1, 1943. High school graduates, college students and men from the fleet reported to units at 131 colleges ranging in national prominence from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and Notre Dame to <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Forty-one of those units had Marine detachments. Crammed with math, physics and military discipline, the V-12s went on to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> midshipmen's schools or Marine officer candidates school _ and from there to billets at sea and in the field. After their service, thousands became corporate executives, business owners, doctors, lawyers and judges, bankers, prominent newspaper and television newsmen, educators and ministers. The men at the colloquium had registered from 104 of the 131 V-12 schools. They stood at attention at the opening reception to salute the colors and sing full-throated versions of `` The National Anthem,'' `` Anchors Aweigh'' and `` The Marines Hymn,'' played by a college <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> drum and bugle corps whose members looked young enough to be their grandchildren. And they told their sea stories. There was the one about the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> chief who warned his men to fall out for the next inspection in whites just out of the laundry. So one fell out with his uniform still dripping wet.

 Then there was the Marine who confessed that he forgot to unload his rifle while on a field exercise, accidentally kicked it and shot himself in an embarrassing place. There were wild stories about liberty in towns near their schools, tales of learning what they thought was the manly military art of drinking, stories of circumventing the rigors of math and physics, close-order drill and calisthenics and curfews for their dates at religion-oriented schools. And they talked about why they came to the meeting. `` V-12 was pure luxury for a child of the Depression,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a Marine trainee at <ORGANIZATION> Redlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. And it was more. An educator told why. <PERSON> Meldrim </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, stocky, ruddy and erect at 84, was a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> public schools administrator commissioned as a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander to skipper the V-12 unit at <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` Nothing in my lifetime has been as significant in education as the V-12 program,'' he said. V-12, as he and others pointed out, not only gave Depression-strapped young men a start on education, a commission and leadership experience, it also saved many small schools from going under in a wartime shortage of male students and funds. Back in 1943, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON> was a poor boy from <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, struggling to work and stay in school and afraid he would n't make it Today, sharp features framed by a mane of white hair, he is a mathematics professor at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and travels around the country teaching other professors how to teach. <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Wabash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> V-12 who served on a rocket ship in the invasion of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, said: `` V-12 was the most important event in my life. Without it, I might not have been able to finish my bachelor's degree, probably would n't have gone on to a master's, and certainly not to a Ph.D.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON>, was struggling to stay in school. He enlisted as a Marine and V-12 kept him in the unit at <LOCATION> Yale </LOCATION>. He was commissioned, led a company in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and served for 20 years, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. His retirement pay let him fulfill his ambition to become an Episcopalian priest, and that led him to <ORGANIZATION> Abaco </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Burly and silver-haired, with a pink, cherubic face, he ministers to a poverty-ridden, all-black parish in an area so poor there are no telephones. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, who had no idea what he wanted to be after high school, went to medical school after the war because of his <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> education, then served 17 years as an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> doctor and now is a heart surgeon in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> schooling led him into medicine, too. He is in private practice and a colonel who runs a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> hospital unit at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamitos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Why `` Because the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> taught me to love the military.'' <PERSON> Thadeus </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcyan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, had n't planned to attend the reunion. But the husky <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>'s small wife took care of that. `` I told him I was sick and tired of listening to V-12 stories and he had to come here and relive his old experiences,'' <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcyan </PERSON> said. She laughed. `` I was still in high school in the war, and a nun who had two nephews in V-12 told me that all V-12s were wonderful heroes, and maybe that's why I fell for him.'' But in those threatening war days there were moments of low morale, impatience and doubt. The men had enlisted to fight the Japanese and the Germans _ and here they were, in uniform but still in college. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> V-12 at landlocked <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> wrote a `` V-12 Victory Song'' that throbbed with youthful fervor. The first verse went like this: `` Rolling, rolling over tossing waters `` That's the life for you and me. `` O rolling, rolling like our <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s fathers `` Who died for liberty.'' V-12s were in the <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> invasion and in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Saipan </LOCATION> through Iwo Jima and <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>. Men who stayed in the reserve were called back for the fighting in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Some shipped over as regulars, fought in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and became <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captains and admirals, Marine colonels and generals. Now, on a cool <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> afternoon, these old salts had orders to fall out _ uniform of the day: ball caps and sports clothes _ and march six blocks to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION>. The march of men and wives could best be called a straggle. But at the memorial, they pulled together into a tight group around a heroic bronze statue of a lone sailor, legs braced and shoulders squared as if against a gale. Then they reverently laid a wreath in tribute to fighting men of the sea. This was the time for memories of combat and buddies lost. At the final banquet, the <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chanters </ORGANIZATION>, a mixed chorus of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION>, sang. When `` Anchors Aweigh'' began, the voices of the V-12s, their first reunion nearly over, swelled again, inundating the chorus' special arrangement with billows of sound. And finally there was a resolution: that another <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> V-12 National Colloquium be held in 1993, the 50th anniversary year, at an appropriate place and time. The `` ayes'' had it with a roar.

 Mud, in his eye, is as glamorous as concrete. And as useful, in building houses poor people can afford.

 In his youth, Egyptian architect <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> was determined to find a way to house the world's poor. As years became decades, others sought answers in steel and concrete. Their high-rises grew higher. Their little boxes dotted hillsides. But <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON>, looking to the magic beneath him, turned mud bricks, volcanic rock and sand into design masterpieces. For generations of young architects, he became a prophet, a Picasso of the earth. His sweeping domed creations with shaded courtyards and latticed windows mellowed the harshness of the relentless desert sun against the expanse of a windblown <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. They are seen not only in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> but on a sun-baked mesa in the American West, reviving the use of mud brick, or adobe, in the Islamic community <PERSON> Dar </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Islam </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Abiquiu </LOCATION>, N.M. In the land of his birth, however, where housing problems are acute, <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON>'s remarkably simple solutions remain stillborn. Unable to convince either successive Egyptian governments or the poor that mud is as glamorous as concrete, <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> has found a following mainly among Egyptian intellectuals and Western architects. Now 89 and in ill health, <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> has seen his world narrow, but not his dreams. Surrounded by slender minarets, <PERSON> Saladin </PERSON>'s lusty <ORGANIZATION> Citadel </ORGANIZATION> and scores of cats, <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> struggles in his aerie above <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to complete projects for three Egyptian oases. He's nearly done. `` People say to use mud bricks for housing is to take a step backward, but in reality it's turning forward,'' <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Concrete blocks bear no human reference ... `` It's disgusting when you lose hope, when you think your ideas are not being accepted in the right way, when people you want to serve ca n't grasp, do n't want to understand. Every day in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, around the world, babies and children are dying from improper housing. `` I have the answer, but nobody will listen. The answer is under foot.'' An admirer is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, an architectural critic who pays homage to <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> in his just-published book `` A Vision of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.'' `` A movement is developing which seeks to rediscover the Islamic and indigenous heritage, and to learn from the local environment the wisdom of ancestors, who knew so well how to build appropriately for the prevailing climatic conditions,'' Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> writes. `` People in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> are now listening with increasing interest to a remarkable Egyptian architect called Dr. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> who, for 40 years, has had to put up with persistent vitriolic criticism and denigration by the modernist architectural establishment.'' Even so, the world's poor, some 800 million, remain out of reach. For them, <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> says, there is no hope of decent housing until officials take a different view of their plight. `` Government officials can not grasp how poor poor is,'' he wrote in the now-classic `` Architecture for the Poor,'' standard reading in architecture courses around the world. `` Abandoned by <PERSON> God </PERSON> and man, -LRB- the poor -RRB- live out their short, diseased and ugly lives in the dirt and discomfort to which they are born. They need decent houses, but houses are expensive. `` None of the apostles of mass production and prefabrication seem to realize just how poor an Egyptian peasant is. There is no factory on Earth that can produce houses these villagers can afford. `` How can people so poor that they can not even afford to buy ready-baked bread even dream of a factory-made house.'' <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> says governments can save money and spur initiative by letting peasants form cooperatives to do the work themselves and encouraging them to use free or cheap materials according to their environment: mud, stone, limestone, wood or reeds. `` Once when a man wanted to build a house, he would launch into some of the most complex and prolonged decision-making of his life,'' <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> says. `` It used to be the house of my father where every step had a meaning. Today, it is the house of my Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, where every step has a dollar value.'' Peasant housing in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, he says, is vastly inferior to ancient housing, mud-brick structures that often outlasted even pyramids. Domed, with mud-brick walls arched to give life and air, traditional housing gave way to what is seen in the Egyptian countryside today, low-slung hovels filled with smoke from cooking fires. <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> struggled to discover what the ancients knew, how to shape and curve mud bricks. In 1941 his search took him to the southern Egyptian village of <LOCATION> Gharb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aswan </LOCATION>, where tradition had n't clashed with modern technology. `` Every house was a wonder, every house different,'' he says. `` A whole village of spacious, lovely, clean and harmonious houses, each more beautiful than the last.'' The impact is evident in any Fathy design. In 1980 he and two village masons soared arches and domes into the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> sky for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first mud-brick mosque. `` The Americans were willing, but not the Egyptians,'' he says. `` Americans have no inferiority complex. They're open-minded.'' That thought led <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> to recall his greatest heartache: In the 1940s, the Egyptian government wanted to shift the 6,000 inhabitants of <ORGANIZATION> Gourna </ORGANIZATION>, a village on the west side of the Nile opposite present-day <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION>. Officials hoped transplanting the population would end a bustling centuries-old local business of tomb robbing. Hired to construct a mud-brick village, <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> wanted each house to suit the needs of an individual family. His ideals, however, immediately clashed with bureucratic dicta that said the poor were too ignorant to decide for themselves. Officials stopped the project, the families were not transferred, and buildings that had been finished remained empty, a ghost town. <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> chronicled his dashed hopes in `` Architecture for the Poor.'' `` A peasant never talks about art,'' he wrote. `` He makes it.'' <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> spent the next years designing public and private buildings in his homeland, his stunning use of mud brick and other natural materials gradually earning him an international reputation. `` When <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> begins to design a house, he never thinks if he's building for a prince or a pauper,'' says <PERSON> Nawal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, a friend and adviser. The <ORGANIZATION> Aga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which recognizes Islamic architectural excellence, gave <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> its first Chairman's Award in 1980, noting `` his commitment to the poor and his extraordinary aesthetic sense'' and hailing him as a `` champion of indigenous building. `` <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> has taught us the value of ... environment,'' the jury said. `` He has shown us that the lessons to be learned are modern lessons.''

 Helicopter 901 clattered toward the towering pillar of smoke with six men and a woman who would charge the wildfire alone, with only hand tools and little chance of getting away if things went badly.

With no escape route, the firefighters weahered the inferno inside heat-resistant fire tents. It was too much for one of the firefighters, who panicked and ran. He was rescued by a crew captain, and later was fired. Since 1973, one member of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s airborne firefighting corps has been killed and 11 have been seriously injured. Aboard Helicopter 101, Fire Protection Capt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> explains that once the helicopter drops off the firefighters, they are largely on their own. `` We're breaking all the rules by going in in front of the fire and watching our escape route fly away,'' he says. The idea is to swiftly control a small fire before it gets big. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which claims to have the largest firefighting force in the world, places more emphasis on helitack than does the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which has had to reduce crew sizes to five or less due to budget cutbacks. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with nine helicopter bases, has more helitack units than any other state. `` Air 901 is five minutes out,'' radioes pilot <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>, his eyes scanning the flames racing over a mountain on a rugged oak-studded ranch in <LOCATION> Tehama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> Chico </LOCATION>. Gloved hands of the crew members recheck yellow fire-resistant suits, plastic helmets and belts bristling with up to 30 pounds of gear. Each member of the crew, reduced by one to make room for a news reporter, packs a book-size pouch containing one of the heat-reflecting `` shake and bake'' tents they may have to dive into if they are overtaken by fire. Hand signals flash across the cramped compartment of the lime-green UH-1F `` Huey'' helicopter, one of the workhorses of the Vietnam War. Suddenly, the helicopter tilts so the crew is staring out side windows at flames below. As 901 circles the blaze, the two crew captains and pilot _ in a clipped language of their own _ pick a landing zone and path of attack for the firefighters. `` This is the kind of fire that will be up to us to hold,'' says <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, the 35-year-old lead captain. Air tankers dispatched to drop fire retardant had yet to arrive. Fire engines were still lumbering over winding roads miles away. The chopper touches down in an explosion of dust at the base of the mountain. The crew swings into action. Some pull shovels and hoe-like brooms from an outside compartment, uncomfortably close to searing jet exhaust spewing into the 100-degree day. Others unpack a bag and hook it under the helicopter so the ship, stripped of the crew's weight, could drop water from a nearby pond on the blaze and on the firefighters if things go badly. The crew bounds up the mountain. The helicopter that should have lifted off behind them did not. An air controller in a small fixed-wing airplane overhead had ordered it to hold. Within seconds, an air tanker roars over dropping retardant. The helicopter climbs and swings toward the pond. Burns waves half the crew one way around the fire; Capt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, with the rest, goes the other way. Flames lick at their elbows as they hack control lines through walls of smoke. Fire snakes through grass, dying at the control line. An inferno in an oak tree dies in a crushing torrent of water dumped by the helicopter. Twenty minutes after landing, there came cheers of victory. The firefighters had linked up after encircling the fire. Their job was done: Ground crews were arriving. The engine crews would handle `` mop up,'' the tedious, slog-through-the-ashes job of dousing every last ember. Investigators would probe the cause, but it was evident. A jeep, pile of firewood and chainsaw had been abandoned on the hilltop. The helitack crew, which had held the blaze to three acres, would fly back to base to be in place for the next run. The helicopter is playing an increasing role in wildland firefighting because it is more like a fire engine than an air tanker, according to a recent state study. Besides shuttling a helitack crew and dropping water, it can be used for reconnaissance, rescue, evacuation and cargo delivery. The effectiveness of the program is reflected in this year's statistics in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> As of Sept. 25, 6,056 fires had burned 68,880 acres, down from last year's 6,831 blazes over 167,696 acres. The human cost of the 16-year-old program is high at times. Helitack crewman <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullins </PERSON> was burned to death in a 1987 fire in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> region. The <PERSON> Vina </PERSON> crew itself was forced to deploy fire shelters as a wall of flames roared at them during <LOCATION> Lassen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s Eagle fire in July. `` We could hear the fire and the wind roaring from inside the tents,'' says <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, a 22-year-old crew member with five years of helitack experience. A firefighter with less experience ran instead of deploying a fire tent. <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, 33, finally was able to hold up one of the shelters so he and the firefighter could stand behind it. `` It was n't planned. I was n't trying to be a hero or anything,'' <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> says. No one was injured, but the firefighter was fired.

<TEXT>
 Clinging to the southern flank of the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION> massif is a snug shelter of glass and wood, a place with an indoor view of one of the world's most astounding outdoor scenes. People come to the <ORGANIZATION> Sheldon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to climb staggering walls of gray rock ringing the <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Glacier </PERSON>, to ski or just to look and listen. They gaze at the intricacies of <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s tallest peak, and its cousins, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beard </LOCATION> and the ragged Rooster Comb. They listen to the quiet of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> twilight, hear the wind and the sliding snow. The hexagonal house is a simple place in an extraordinary environment. The structure can become a solarium as sun beats through the large windows on five of six sides. The building, at 5,810 feet, also is a shelter from the fierce storms of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION>. The house, in a glacial amphitheater with a clear view of 20,320-foot <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>'s summit, is a half-hour flight from <LOCATION> Talkeetna </LOCATION>. The trip takes in the confluence of three rivers, miles of scrubby black spruce and brown tundra, dozens of ponds, brown at first and then brilliant blue as the glacial moraine appears below. Toothy pinnacles jut toward the sky as the plane drones through a gorge. The late <PERSON> bush </PERSON> pilot <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> designed the <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and supervised its construction in 1966. He acquired five acres in the Ruth Amphitheater before it became part of Denali National Park and Preserve. The house was built for use by mountaineers, photographers and sightseers. `` It's been booked solid for the last five or six years,'' says <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON>, who was the radio operator when her husband landed ski-equipped airplanes on <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Glacier </PERSON>. `` It's been a gradual evolution, just like the growth of the tourist industry in <LOCATION> Talkeetna </LOCATION>.'' The house is perched on a jagged outcropping about 100 feet above a snowfield that serves as a runway. `` The glaciers are moving and changing,'' <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> says. `` It was hard to find a stable place to build the house.'' Once it was built, the 196-square-foot house proved up to the test of 20 years of harsh weather and seasonal occupancy. Sixty-five dollars buys a night's lodging and wood for the stove. An outhouse stands 50 yards away. The house is furnished with four cushioned benches that double as beds. Visitors are expected to bring sleeping bags and their own food, although previous occupants have left supplies. Cereal, canned stew, four kinds of mustard, pancake mix and real maple syrup are among the provisions. Packed along two walls of the one-room house is more culinary equipment _ including a wok _ than many home kitchens can claim. There are things to read in this mountain studio, as well. Books and magazines line part of a shelf, along with Scrabble and other games. A chin-up bar fashioned from a stick of firewood, a mountaineer's carabiner and nylon webbing hangs from the slanted ceiling. But for the landings and takeoffs by planes that use the ice-and-snow runway below the house, it would be insulated from the world outside. At the height of the summer tourist season, light planes carrying sightseers interested in 10 minutes on <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Glacier </PERSON> land several times an hour. Noise echoes from one ridge to another as the planes come and go, the snow acting as a brake that allows them to land in one-fourth the space needed for takeoff. Users of the <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over the years have included organized mountaineering groups. Genet Expeditions of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> rented the building during the month of May for several years, with the house serving as a base of operations and clients sleeping in tents nearby. `` It was nice to be able to dry out gear,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Howerton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Genet </PERSON> Expeditions general manager and a guide. `` It just made for a more comfortable recuperation area.'' The house also has served as a base for mountain rescues. <PERSON> Howerton </PERSON> warns against a casual attitude about activities in the <LOCATION> Ruth </LOCATION> area. Precautions that would be adequate in many other cross-country ski areas are n't enough here. He recommends skiers rope themselves together for safety in case one falls into a crevasse while crossing the snow. `` It's a hassle, but skiing roped is the only way to go up there,'' <PERSON> Howerton </PERSON> says. `` It's a place where you have to be very careful.''

 Time is on <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Noone </PERSON>'s mind these days. The former lead singer of <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>'s Hermits, the superstar 1960s English pop group, now is host of `` My Generation,'' dedicated to the music that people his age grew up with. It's a half-hour show on cable television's VH-1. <PERSON> Noone </PERSON>, who turned 42 today, shows film clips of bands of the 1960s and'70s. `` When I was 14, I used to read the ages of these people. They were 26 and 27. I thought, ` These people are too old to be in rock' n' roll.' Now you see the Rolling Stones. These guys are ancient and they're good. I guess that's experience.'' He also interviews musicians of his vintage on the show. But not with the studio-formality of desk and chairs. Instead, he hits the road with his minicam. `` When I go to rock' n' roll shows,'' he says, `` I take the camera with me. With most people I can walk up and say, ` Will you do this bit for my TV show?''' His interest in interviewing stars dates from his own days as a fledgling star. `` When I was 16, I met <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> and interviewed him,'' he says. `` That's going to be on the show. I met Colonel <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and said I wanted to interview <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>, ` because I'm the biggest star in the world after him.' I said, ` We're playing the <LOCATION> Hula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bowl </LOCATION> tonight.' He asked how many tickets we sold. I said, ` 100,000.' He said, ` You can interview him.' `` It's a short interview, but it's nice.'' Four different shows are seen each week. Each usually is repeated later the same evening. <PERSON> Noone </PERSON> usually features bands that had many hits instead of just one _ `` unless it's one I like.'' An example of the latter is the Easybeats' `` Friday on my Mind,'' which <PERSON> Noone </PERSON> calls `` a great working-class song.'' Minimovie videos of hit singles postdate the `` My Generation'' era but <PERSON> Noone </PERSON> says there are plenty of TV clips and home movies and more turn up all the time. On the show he sometimes tells anecdotes about the music stars he knew in the 1960s. He also knew some of their families. `` <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' father was a fat, jolly man. I knew <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s father better than I knew <PERSON> John </PERSON>. He was a great raconteur. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s sister went to school with my sister.'' <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>'s Hermits, formed in 1962, first came to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1964. It had its biggest year in 1965 and broke up in 1971. Its best-remembered hits are `` Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> You've Got a Lovely Daughter,'' `` I'm <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> the Eighth I Am'' and `` There's a Kind of Hush.'' <PERSON> Noone </PERSON> did n't leave show business after the demise of <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>'s Hermits He sang solo. In 1982, he was the fourth singer to play <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> in `` The Pirates of Penzance'' on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. Early this year, <ORGANIZATION> Cypress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> released `` I'm Into Something Good,'' <PERSON> Noone </PERSON>'s remake of <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>'s Hermits' first hit, for the movie `` The Naked Gun. <PERSON> Noone </PERSON> still travels, with a New York-based band. `` We've rehearsed 100 songs, from the'60s,'70s and'80s,'' he says. `` If they call for ` Ferry Across the Mersey,' which was <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> and the Pacemakers' hit, we do it, of course. We play anything.'' He even does an imitation of <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> singing `` Pinball Wizard'' -LRB- from the Who's rock opera `` Tommy'' -RRB-. `` I think the audience needs a laugh sometimes.'' <PERSON> Noone </PERSON> is from a <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> family. He and an older sister grew up in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, living with their grandmother while their father, who got out of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in 1947, went back to college. `` My youngest brother is 17. There are just five of us but we're all spread out. When a celebration of the 25th anniversary of <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>'s Hermits' first American tour was held in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> recently, <PERSON> Noone </PERSON>'s 3-year-old daughter thought it must be <PERSON> Daddy </PERSON>'s birthday and asked where his cake Married 21 years, <PERSON> Noone </PERSON> and his wife live in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Another current project of <PERSON> Noone </PERSON>'s is producing a record for the English group <ORGANIZATION> Johnny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> `` The leader is the son of <PERSON> Mickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Most </PERSON>, the producer who made <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>'s Hermits records,'' he says. `` We'd be in the studio and he'd say, ` This song is n't working out. Let's go out and have a beer.' We'd come back and it would usually work.''

 The blonde pigtails have been gone for more than 30 years, replaced today by what looks like a modified <PERSON> Farrah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawcett </PERSON> cut, but <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> still has that impish, almost wicked smile theatergoers remember from `` The Bad Seed.'' She has done other things, but <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> will be identified forever with that horror classic in which she played <PERSON> Rhoda </PERSON> <PERSON> Penmark </PERSON>, a sweet, polite, 8-year-old murderer. The <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> drama was a hit on Broadway in 1954 and two years later became a successful movie for which <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> received an Academy Award nomination. `` It's so hard when you do something that's noticed so much, especially if you continue to work,'' the 44-year-old actress says now. `` You can have credits up to here, but not everybody knows them. The one people focus on is the one that got the notoriety.'' But there was life after little <PERSON> Rhoda </PERSON> _ a marriage, two children, movies, a short-lived TV series, guest shots on numerous other television shows and stage appearances, mostly on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Now <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> has begun a national tour in `` Rumors,'' the <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> comedy smash that will take her across the country during the next nine months. Rehearsals for the tour brought her back to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theater for the first time since `` The Bad Seed'' and triggered memories of her days here as a child actress. `` Growing up, I always played people who had a peculiar side to them,'' she says. `` I never did <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> roles. I always looked like something else was going on. `` So much of the work we did back then on television was theater-like. Even the procedure. We had three weeks' rehearsal. And we tried things and threw them out if they did n't work. Not like television today. You do n't rehearse.'' <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>'s career began in the early'50s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> when her mother, a former professional roller skater, carted her off to auditions. `` Things just seemed to happen. I had a terrible lisp, and my mother took me to this woman to correct it,'' she recalls. `` And the woman had show business connections.'' It led to her first Broadway show, `` Touchstone,'' with <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, which ran for one week. The following year, she was a star in `` The Bad Seed.'' `` I had the same growing difficulties that anybody had. People would say about me, ` You're such a normal kid.' And of course I was n't. But I kept thinking, ` I am a normal kid. I am a normal kid.' And that's confusing. `` I did what I did purely as a kid, because kids are almost natural actors. But then as life goes on, you try to be this for that person and that for this person, and you kind of get lost in the shuffle. And I think I did. I'm coming to terms with that now.'' The film version of `` The Bad Seed'' brought a nearly teen-age <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> where she did movies like `` Kathy-O'' and her own television series called `` <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>'s Bad Girl.'' `` At 16, my interest in show business dropped,'' says the daughter of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firefighter. `` I was confused: ` What do I really want to be?' Of course, we still ask that, but we do n't tell anyone. `` Kid actors have a hard time in life. Maybe it's because you do n't know who to be. `` I moved back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. I went to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utrecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. I worked real hard at being anonymous. I even took back my real name, which is <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>.'' From the time she was 18 to 21, <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> abandoned acting. She went to beauty school, sang with a rock' n' roll band -LRB- <PERSON> Mikey </PERSON> <PERSON> Vee </PERSON> and the Imperials -RRB- and worked in a talent agency for child models. `` I traveled into the city like I played another part. I was trying things. I had a real job,'' <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> says. Then she started to miss show business. At age 21, she went back to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and slowly began working again. She got married in 1967 and had two children, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON>. `` I had this fantasy about being the perfect mommy, but then my marriage did n't last,'' she recalls. `` So half the characters were gone. Work again became important to me.'' For a while during her career, most prominently when she was in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television series `` The Ropers,'' <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> changed her professional name to <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>. `` I thought if I was called ` <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>,' I would stand up taller and feel like the woman I did n't feel like,'' she says. `` And of course, it did n't help at all. Then I thought, ` Well, this is absurd. A name does not do it for you.' Plus I was with someone at that time who liked it. I was influenced by what he thought. But it did n't change anything.'' Today, <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> again thinks of herself as a working actress. She works regularly on television, having just completed an episode of the syndicated series `` Freddy's Nightmares.'' In it, she gets her eyes gouged out. `` It was fun,'' she giggles. `` I guess I still have a bizarre sense of humor. `` Before I got married and had my kids, I did a tour of another <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> play, ` Barefoot in the Park,''' <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> says. `` It was the first play I had done since ` The Bad Seed' and that was frightening. But I fell right into it.''

 Grim-faced, the teen-age boys squatted around a Kurdish guerrilla showing them how to strip and assemble a machine gun. Soon, they would be using the weapon in a conflict that is almost 70 years old _ the Kurds' fight for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Iraqi-backed Kurdish <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> has in recent weeks stepped up its attacks on Iranian military bases and economic targets. Guerrilla chieftains at the <ORGANIZATION> KDP </ORGANIZATION> base camp here in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> mountains said the youngsters will go into action, as their fathers and grandfathers have before them, in the mountains of northwestern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` They get three months' training in weapons, explosives and guerrilla tactics, then join units inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to carry out hit-and-run attacks,'' said the camp commander, who would identify himself only as <PERSON> Salam </PERSON>. It is a war that has largely been overshadowed by Kurdish campaigns in neighboring <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> itself. In southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been fighting a guerrilla war for five years to establish a separate Marxist state. About 20 million Kurds _ <ORGANIZATION> Sunni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> stock _ live in an overlapping area where the borders of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> converge, a region once known as <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> all have faced rebellions by their Kurdish minorities. But <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is nonetheless backing the Iranian Kurds in an extension of its decades-old rivalry with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> backed Iraqi Kurds in their war against the government in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> during the 8-year Iran-Iraq war. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> aids Kurdish fighters in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> KDP </ORGANIZATION> fighters, clearly with <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> consent, stepped up their attacks after their veteran leader, <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Qassemlou </PERSON>, was assassinated July 13 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. His successor, <PERSON> Sa'eed </PERSON> <PERSON> Badal </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Qassemlou </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in response to an offer from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> to negotiate an end to the Kurdish rebellion. <PERSON> Badal </PERSON> said he believes <PERSON> Qassemlou </PERSON> was killed by agents of radical Iranian factions in an attempt to torpedo <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s efforts to end the mountain war, a move that would have strengthened his credibility as a pragmatist. <PERSON> Sa'eed </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> KDP </ORGANIZATION> has turned down an Iranian proposal to resume negotiations because `` we no longer trust them.'' The guerrillas, known as Peshmergas, or `` those who face death,'' say hundreds of young Iranian Kurds have joined them in recent months. Kurdish chieftains decline to divulge their strength but claim they are pinning down some 200,000 Iranians. Diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> estimated that as many as 2,500 <ORGANIZATION> KDP </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas are in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, with thousands more operating inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Everybody in my village said the Peshmergas are working for a better future for the Kurdish nation, so I decided to join them,'' said <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pour </PERSON>, 14, who trekked across the mountains for seven days until the guerrillas found him. About 200 youngsters are undergoing guerrilla training in this camp high in the northern <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> mountains overlooking the Iranian border. In the camp are about 1,000 guerrillas, dressed in their distinctive baggy trousers and turbans. Several thousand Kurdish women and children live in villages in the surrounding valleys. The <ORGANIZATION> KDP </ORGANIZATION> runs the camp, but the area is under Iraqi military control. The guerrillas are not allowed to leave without <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> permission. The Kurds grow their own vegetables and tend their cattle in the lush uplands. The Iraqis provide flour, rice and fuel oil. A rehabilitation center has been set up in the camp for guerrillas who have lost limbs. Among the 30 undergoing therapy is <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Muradi </PERSON>, 23, who lost an arm in a recent raid. `` I do n't care if I have to live in this camp, deprived of the good things of life, for 50 years, so long as the next generation of Kurds can live as free human beings,'' said <PERSON> Muradi </PERSON>, who joined the guerrillas last year. A five-member French medical team from two relief agencies, <ORGANIZATION> Medecins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontieres </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION>, operates a makeshift hospital in the base. The team alternates with others who spend three-month tours in the mountains. `` Conditions are pretty primitive,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Breveau </PERSON>, a surgeon from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> who is on his third tour. `` We've eliminated serious diseases, but there's a lot of malnutrition and back pains, which are common among mountain people.'' <PERSON> Breveau </PERSON>, who also has worked in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and with Tamil rebels in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> off southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, said he misses life in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and his family. `` But these people need my help more than the people of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` There's a great satisfaction when you save someone who would have died if there had been no surgeon.'' The Kurds were promised an independent state in the Treaty of Sevres of 1920. But the great powers sliced up <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> among <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Since then, the Kurds have been in a constant state of revolt against one or more of these states. The Kurdish revolt in <LOCATION> Persia </LOCATION>, which later became known as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, began in 1920. Kurdish hopes of self-rule have been hampered by internal rivalries that have prevented a unified strategy. Nonetheless, morale among the Iranian Kurds in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> appears high. <PERSON> Qader </PERSON> <PERSON> Agha </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>, an 83-year-old former Iranian army officer, joined the rebels 43 years ago when the Soviets seized part of northern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1945 and set up the short-lived Kurdish Mahabad republic. It lasted only about a year before the Iranians reclaimed the territory. It's the closest the Kurds anywhere have ever come to having an independent state. `` I've spent half my life fighting for freedom and <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>, now frail and going deaf. `` They've been hard, difficult years. But I still believe that one day we will win.'' One of his sons was killed fighting the Iranians. Three others are in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` I've never laid down my gun,'' the grizzled old warrior said, patting his AK-47 assault rifle.

 A 5-year-old war between Marxist Kurdish guerrillas and security forces is driving thousands of Kurdish civilians from their villages in southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to safer areas. Of 2,000 people killed so far in the conflict, at least 700 have been listed as Kurdish farmers. Guerrillas of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are fighting to establish an independent Marxist state in the Kurdish areas in eastern and southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The scope of the support they have from Kurdish civilians could not be independently determined but Kurdish resentment toward <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> security forces has been building. It reached a high poiint in mid-September when a crowd clashed with police in the township of <LOCATION> Silopi </LOCATION> while protesting the killing of six Kurds a few days earlier. The security forces maintained the victims were guerrillas, but local residents claimed they were farmers taking fruit to the town market. The locals charged the victims were shot as suspected rebels. An investigating group from <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> bore them out. `` It is very sad but the people are right,'' said <PERSON> Nurettin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` Our investigation in the town and taped testimony of many witnesses support their claim.'' <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> and two other <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members have urged the prosecution of those responsible. For years, the local Kurds have complained that if they do n't help the guerrillas, they risk being killed by them If they do help them, they face imprisonment by the security forces and sometimes torture. Security officials contend it is difficult to distinguish the guerrillas from the farmers and herdsmen of the 300 small hamlets in the region. Some officials acknowledge that local support for the guerrillas is increasing, mainly out of fear and in some cases because of mistreatment by government forces. Residents complain most about the special anti-terrorist police in the southeastern area, the Parliament group said. `` Maybe it is because of their commando training but they are very harsh with the local people,'' <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> said. `` The people are increasingly becoming alienated from the state. There is cause for anxiety,'' said <PERSON> Fuat </PERSON> <PERSON> Atalay </PERSON>, a Social Democrat from <LOCATION> Diyarbakir </LOCATION>, the largest province in the area. During a recent parliamentary debate, Interior Minister <PERSON> Abdulkadir </PERSON> <PERSON> Aksu </PERSON> said that only those suspected of aiding and harboring guerrillas were detained. He contended that police and soldiers were trying to save lives in an area where he said the guerrillas had killed 618 civilians and 336 security personnel in the past two years. However, the aspirations and grievances of the Kurdish minority, a taboo subject in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> until recent years, now find expression even in parliamentary debates in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>. Members from the Kurdish areas are demanding increased government investment in the Kurdish provinces, where the jobless rate of 35 percent is double the national average. The Kurds also are demanding that the education, publications and broadcasts in the Kurdish language _ now forbidden _ be allowed. `` Like ostrichs burying their heads in the sand, we are still debating, in this day and age, whether there are Kurds in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON>.

 Belgians jokingly call a morning train that pulls out of <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> with mostly middle-class passengers to nearby <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> `` Le Train des Fraudeurs'' _ The Cheaters' Train. The nickname stems from the financial business assumed to be carried on by the train's passengers in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, which has long lured investors because of its strict banking secrecy and tax breaks. But the country, which is smaller than <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and overshadowed by neighboring <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, has been honing other financial skills to compete in the single market that will be created in late 1992 when the 12 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> take down old trade barriers that restrict the free movement of people, money, goods and services. Local officials appear to want to shed <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>'s image as a savings and tax haven. Several interviewed played down the importance of the country's secrecy and tax provisions. Whatever, the Grand Duchy of <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, a country of just 372,000 people -LRB- about the same as <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> -RRB-, clearly has appeal. <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> now has 156 banks _ only a handful <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> _ many of which are on <ORGANIZATION> Boulevard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>, known as <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>'s Wall Street. About 650 investment funds and some 100 reinsurance companies also operate from here. The stock market trades some 8,400 issues, about 75 percent of which are bonds denominated in dollars or major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies. In an interview, Prime Minister <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Santer </PERSON> expressed satisfaction with the financial center. `` -LRB- It -RRB- has not only grown but has also ... developed its own specificity and is now competitive with all other, bigger centers,'' he said in his office at government house. The center was hurt by the banking crisis in the early 1980s when major developing countries were unable to meet their foreign debt payments. But it has since rebounded and the outlook remains bright, according to analysts. Among the advantages they cite are the country's social and political stability, central location in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, strong government support and multilingual population. It also has no central bank to apply credit controls or reserve requirements on banks as a means of shaping monetary policy. Moreover, a recent report from the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 24 industrialized nations, remarked on the country's pluses: `` One of the special attractions of the <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> financial market from a tax standpoint is that there is no withholding tax on dividend or interest payments for non-residents and that stockmarket transactions are not taxed. `` Here too, changes in the taxation system _ corporation tax reduced from 40 to 34 percent between 1987 and 1989, the abolition of stamp duty on securities issues _ mean that the Grand Duchy now ranks as one of the world's most attractive financial markets.'' Still another advantage, it said, was a decision this year to spell out the right to banking secrecy in relation to tax authorities. Disclosure of information about customers' bank accounts is prohibited, except in criminal cases. Moves to strengthen the financial center will no doubt help <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> compete in the 1992 market that will be formed when the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> lifts the trade barriers. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> already has approved measures requiring the lifting of controls on the movement of capital _ or money _ by July 1. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, which still have some restrictions on foreign bank accounts held by their citizens, intend to comply, possibly before that date. Less-advanced member nations _ <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> _ have more time to do so. The <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> report cautions that the single market drive `` means that <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> will almost certainly have to adjust again to changes in the international financial environment.'' It warns about moves to impose a European-wide withholding tax on interest income. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive body, unveiled a plan earlier this year for a minimum withholding rate of 15 percent throughout the trading bloc. It was later scaled down to 10 percent.

 The proposal, requiring unanimous approval, was fought by <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and other countries. `` I think at this point it is a dead issue,'' said Prime Minister <PERSON> Santer </PERSON>. In pushing the measure, the commission argued it was needed to halt tax evasion once capital controls were lifted. `` There is thus a risk that, once investors are free to open bank accounts in other member states, they will not declare their interest income to their national tax authorities and will thus illegally evade payment of tax,'' it said. That might lead, it added, to a substantial loss of revenue in many countries. West German authorities introduced a 10 percent withholding tax at the start of the year, only to repeal it in the summer. Analysts believe a substantial amount of money flowed out of the country, some into <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. Most analysts do not expect much to happen on July 1 since many capital controls already have been lifted. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornish </PERSON>, European markets strategist at <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, noted, however, `` In principle, if there's a lot of money pent up in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> by the restrictions, the money could flow out.'' Fresh from apparent victory on the withholding front, Luxembourgers shrug off suggestions they might be hurt by greater competition from other money centers. `` We've always had open frontiers,'' said <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> Rau </PERSON>, managing director of Credit European, a subsidiary of a Belgian bank, and head of the national legislature's finance committee. `` We are probably the country least concerned among all the 12 with the lifting of -LRB- capital -RRB- controls in 1990,'' he said. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Krier </PERSON>, senior executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luxembourg </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Luxembourg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> and Bankers, agreed: `` <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> has certain advantages which can not disappear.'' The nation's bankers must be innovative to keep pace, <PERSON> Santer </PERSON> said. `` The bigger the capital markets where a banking center can operate, -LRB- the -RRB- more opportunities there are _ of course, the more competition there is,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaans </PERSON>, general director of the <ORGANIZATION> Luxembourg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Officials believe some banks want to move to <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> before the 1992 deadline for the European-wide market. The number of banks has grown from 112 in June 1984 to 156 now. Officials expect it to reach 160 by year's end. The majority of the banks have European parents, with West Germans topping the list at 37 banks as of June. Banks with <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> or Belgian roots reached 19, and 13 were counted as Swiss. Only nine were American, the same as Japanese. Luxembourgers bridle at questions about dirty money operations, often attracted to banking centers steeped in secrecy. The legislature recently enacted a measure setting tough penalties for the laundering of drug money. `` We have no interest ... to have this reputation, and therefore we are very strongly against this situation,'' <PERSON> Santer </PERSON> said. Agreed <PERSON> Jaans </PERSON>, `` Since we are so small ... we have to be particularly cautious.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year accused a bank owned by a <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> holding company of taking part in an international ring that laundered millions of dollars in profits for the Colombian cocaine trade. The bank denied the charges.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s economy is surging ahead, but it's a long, long way to full employment. Inflation is down to a modest 4 percent and economic growth is expected to surpass 5 percent next year. Exports are projected to reach an all-time high of $ 19.3 billion this year with a trade surplus of nearly $ 700 million. Unemployment has decreased from 19.7 percent in January 1987, but only to 17.3 percent, and the rate of emigration has climbed. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is enjoying `` a very strong recovery from a fairly dismal period of no growth,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON>, a senior researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. The indicators have improved just since summer, <PERSON> Fitz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> said, and the institute has revised its economic growth forecast for this year upward by a full percentage point. The institute forecasts that growth will stay above 4 percent a year through 1993, inflation will remain low and the government can expect budget surpluses by 1992. `` There are few economies in the industrialized world now in a position to make the kind of optimistic projections we can, or to point to such an improvement in such a short space of time,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> said recently. `` The emphasis now must be on translating rising economic growth into more jobs,'' he added. While the unemployment rate has declined in the past two years, it still is nearly double the average of 9.3 percent in the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, of which <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is a member. Only <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, at 17.4 percent, reported worse. `` There are fewer people with jobs in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> than there were in 1950,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superiors </ORGANIZATION>. As the number of jobless more than doubled in the 1980s, the economic institute reported, the standard of living for the unemployed declined. That decline, it added, may continue despite the upward trend of the economic indicators. Emigration, a signal of Irish distress since the famine days of the 19th century, is on the rise again. The government's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> reported that 46,000 people left in the 12 months through last April, up from 32,000 the year before. A recent report based on the 1986 census found that net migration from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> between 1981 and 1986 totaled 72,000 _ two-thirds of them 15 to 24 years old. The economic institute's survey predicted that <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> will add 82,000 jobs and cut emigration to 11,000 by 1994. Unemployment is projected to drop to 12.7 percent. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> bailed itself out of deep deficits by slashing public spending, supported by a broad, informal coalition of the politically dominant parties of the right. When <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> called an election this past summer, however, his Fianna Fail party found the voters unhappy about austerity, especially cuts in the health service. Fianna Fail lost seats and <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> clung to power by forming a coalition, a deeply unpopular move within his own ranks, with a splinter party. <PERSON> Fianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Fail </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s dominant party since the 1930s, no longer pursues the dream of a Gaelic-speaking, mostly rural and united island espoused by <PERSON> Eamon </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Valera </PERSON>, the party founder and former prime minister and president. Like other mainstream parties, it aspires to a united <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Indeed, that goal still features prominently in the constitution drawn up by <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Valera </PERSON>. But under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> has accepted that <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> can only become part of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> when a majority of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province's people want to. In its seventh decade of independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, this nation of 3.6 million people is still remarkably dependent on the British economy, which absorbs 30 percent of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s exports and the largest portion of Irish emigres. In economic terms, the people of the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> have reason to envy the life in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. A married couple in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> earning 25,000 Irish pounds pays 9,625 pounds in tax, while a couple in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> earning 25,000 British pounds pays 5,467 pounds in income tax. The cost of living in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, excluding rent, matches <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, though wages are 27 percent lower, according to a 1988 survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION>. Making a virtue of adversity, the government's <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> is promoting <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> as a low-cost base within the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, whose members are to abolish internal tariff barriers by the end of 1992 and create a single market of 320 million people. Labor costs in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> averaged about $ 10 an hour in 1988, compared with $ 11.21 in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and $ 18.38 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the development authority says. <PERSON> Fitz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> says improvements in employment are restrained by a baby boom now working its way through the schools. The children from the peak of that boom are now 9 years old and will be entering the job market within a decade. Though the constitution no longer grants a special role to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> remains 93 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and divorce and abortion are illegal. Even though the birth rate has fallen by more than 25 percent from 1980 to 1987, it remains the highest in the European Economic Community, at 16.6 per 1,000. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, senior lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, says that unless <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> reduces its population growth, it risks becoming `` a permanent low-wage economy and a backwater and peripheral slum region of the new, enlarged <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' He does not believe <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> can ever support all its people, at current rates of growth. `` With the industrial development policy, with its very best efforts to attract foreign companies, they have only managed to replace jobs _ low-wage jobs with high-wage jobs,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said in an interview.

 The ladder of ambition for some of the young men in old <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> begins with breaking a car window, then stealing what's inside the car, then stealing a whole car. Then they burn it, without stripping a few saleable parts. `` They do n't think that far,'' says <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON>, who works with young school dropouts in the rough and ready streets of the Liberties, hoping to steer them away from a life of breaking into cars. The neighborhood where <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> wrote `` Gulliver's Travels'' and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Frideric </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> premiered his `` Messiah'' can be described today by what it lacks: parks, jobs and, for many, a future At a school established by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commmunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON> starts with the basics, teaching often unruly young school dropouts how to iron a shirt, cook a meal or do simple carpentry. `` These young people have never been asked to accept the consequences of their own actions,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, the school's director They and their neighbors are quite unprepared for any economic miracles that may occur, <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> added. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> walked in here and created 2,000 jobs, there would be no one here to take them,'' he said. The Liberties, so called because it is outside the medieval city walls, stands apart from an Irish economy that is generating record trade surpluses and strong economic growth of 5 percent this year. That fortunate <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> is seen on <LOCATION> Grafton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> set the marketing tone, but not on <LOCATION> Meath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, the gritty strip in the Liberties where the inner city assocation has its offices. `` It's a different world really,'' says <PERSON> Roisin </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, whose work at the association includes counseling frightened people in debt to loan sharks. Employment at the Guinness brewery, the neighborhood's biggest industry, has dropped from 4,000 jobs two decades ago to 1,400. <PERSON> Liam </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenlon </PERSON>, who is chairman of the association's board, says the group has put 175 young people to work _ `` people who normally never ever got work, three-fourths of whom, I have no hesitation in saying, would end up in jail.'' The school's courses include woodworking, sewing and photography, and it is placing 60 percent or more of its graduates in fulltime jobs, he says. Three students have been studying German and will go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for three months' work experience. `` If I get a job I'll stay, because there is nothing here,'' says <PERSON> Jinet </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, 17, who left school three years ago. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Duggan </PERSON>, 17, also bound for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, joined the training program a year after being expelled from school _ for throwing chairs, he explains. Then he drifted on the streets. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Domican </PERSON>, 16, is learning carpentry and wants to stay in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> but says the neighborhood needs `` more houses, more jobs, more construction.'' Others can not wait to leave. `` I'd go now but you're not allowed,'' said <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Langley </PERSON>, 15. `` I'd hate leaving my family and friends and where you grew up and all,'' she added. `` Still, they ca n't expect you stay here and live on the dole for the rest of your life.'' Poverty is an ancient presence in the Liberties. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, the dean of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, raged at <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s deprivation and in 1729 offered `` A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> from being a Burden to their Parents or Country.'' In that famous satire, his modest proposal was to eat the young. <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>'s grave in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patrick </LOCATION>'s Cathedral is a highlight of a Liberties tour developed by the inner city association to create four part-time jobs. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> always points out the banners of the Order of St. Patrick in the cathedral and retells the story, possibly apocryphal, of how prospective members demonstrated aristocratic credentials. `` You had to prove that your family had n't worked in 200 years,'' she said. `` We'll all qualify for it soon.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: `Crimes and Misdemeanors'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 For a decade now, <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> has maintained a schizoid quality in his films. With `` Broadway <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>,'' `` The Purple Rose of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'' and `` <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> and Her Sisters,'' he has presented the familiar <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, the heroically neurotic chronicler of the absurdities of urban living. `` Interiors,'' `` September'' and `` Another Woman,'' which <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> wrote and directed but in which he did not appear, reflected darker images derived from his idol, <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>. Now the twain meet in `` Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Like all of <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s movies, it is idiosyncratic, highly original and thought-provoking. But it is unexpectedly cynical. Two parallel but rarely converging plots deal with different segments of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> society. One is show biz. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> is a failed documentary maker whose devotion to esoteric subjects precludes his success. His despairing wife, <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>, wangles him a real job: profiling her brother, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alda </PERSON>, a high-powered television producer. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> is repelled by the crassly commercial <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> but intrigued by his aide, <PERSON> Mia </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrow </PERSON>. The other plot begins with a testimonial dinner extolling the good works of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>, a rich ophthalmologist and benefactor with a loving wife, <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, and family. But for two years, <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> has had a fatal attraction to <PERSON> Anjelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON>. When his mistress grows impatient with unkept promises, <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> fears his comfortable world will collapse. He finds a solution through his black-sheep brother with Mob connections, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Orbach </PERSON>. `` Crimes and Misdemeanors'' climaxes at a wedding, where most of the cast converge. There is an epilogue in which <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> returns to his normal, untroubled life. Despite the murky message, the film can be enjoyed on more than one level. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s dialogue is lucid and insightful, and his skewering of television's idiocies hits the target. Actors always seem to do their best work for <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>'s portrait of a good man susceptible to evil is brilliant <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> captures all the shrewdness and pomposity of the television breed. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> helps bridge the two plots as a rabbi going blind. The Orion release was produced by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenhut </PERSON> and photographed by <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s favorite <PERSON> Sven </PERSON> <PERSON> Nykvist </PERSON>. Rating: PG-13 for adult subject matter. Running time: 104 minutes.

 `` Lawrence of Arabia'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> Home Video. VHS, $ 89.95. Rated PG -RRB- When film students, critics, historians and other buffs are asked to list the best movies ever made, `` Lawrence of Arabia'' appears with well-deserved frequency. This majestic epic is cinematic poetry. When the David Lean masterpiece, which introduced an unknown actor named <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, landed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Dec. 17, 1962, it opened with a few lovely touches including a program book complete with bibliographical and biographical material. Although called a `` camel opera'' by some wags, and homoerotic by others because of its absence of women and glorification of men with men, few could elude the movie's raptures. And the charms and cinematic seductions of `` Lawrence of Arabia'' still hold up on the small screen, despite the thick black frame that allows Cinemascope to be reduced. What's being offered on video is a new, restored version of the film, which played theatrically earlier this year. After a decade, 32 minutes of the movie had been cut and one print contained a complete reversal -LRB- <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>'s watch is switched from hand to hand -RRB-. There were also original editing cuts made when the movie was first released to trim it for American audiences with a short attention span. Lean has restored some of those scenes, at times calling some of his actors -LRB- notably <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON> -RRB- into a studio to record new dialogue. Lean has added a scene in which <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> rudely breaks up a snooker game at the officers' club and a harem scene. The flogging scene before a panting bey -LRB- <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON> -RRB- is more fully developed and suggests even more strongly the sexual connotations. The restoration by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Coates </PERSON>, who won an Academy Award for editing the original movie, takes the film to a running time of 218 minutes. The new version, with an added 20 minutes, is still breathtaking but attempts to more deeply probe the elusive and enigmatic <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. T.E. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> was an arrogant cartographer in the British army who is sent to <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to assist Prince Feisal -LRB- <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON> -RRB- in the 1917-18 Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. He quickly adapts to the desert and the Bedouin way of life _ he drinks water only when his guide does; he eats the same tepid swill as they do. He also becomes a messianic warrior whose strategy and wisdom are matched only by ego and obsession. With his almost virginal white robes, <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, with eyes the deep blue of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and hair the color of golden straw, struts about not with the swagger of the British gentleman but with the stance of a god. Indeed, the exploits <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON> so craftily chisels in his excellent screenplay, paint <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> as a demigod. Unlike many of today's filmmakers who take their audiences to be simpletons, Lean has a keen eye for detail and strives for cultural accuracy. The costumes, props, blocking all hold up today _ `` Lawrence of Arabia'' could have been made in the 1980s. The makeup, however, especially the shoe polish on Guinness, is dated. The performances by a rash of stars who also include <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> in his Western screen debut and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, are excellent. But the movie's real star is the desert with its smouldering dunes and poetry of colors.

 `` Miss Firecracker'' -LRB- HBO Home Video. VHS-Beta, $ 89.99. Rated PG-13 -RRB- How much can one hope for in life? Not much, but that still leaves a lot of room. And as we learn in <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlamme </PERSON>'s `` Miss Firecracker,'' anything is possible. The key is to just be oneself, and to honestly approach and embrace the opportunities in life. <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s story drops enough homilies between the lines to stuff a goosefeather-filled quilt. But these wise little nuggets are drizzled with spice and wit and charm. Carnelle Scott -LRB- <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> -RRB-, a plain little thing who cleans fish in a catfish factory, has spent her life in the shadow of her beautiful cousin, <PERSON> Elain </PERSON>, a delicate but catty magnolia blossom who won the Miss Firecracker beauty contest in 1972. <PERSON> Carnelle </PERSON>, who's known in town as Miss Hot Tamale because of her lusty ways, has held only one dream in life: to win the pageant. So when she reachs the cutoff age, she dies her hair a brassy, fire-engine red, and enters. Her main support is a young woman who is equally plain _ an endearing seamstress with the improbable name of <PERSON> Popeye </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Alfre </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodard </PERSON> -RRB-, who taught herself to sew by making little outfits for her pet frogs as a child. <PERSON> Popeye </PERSON>, whose brother threw gravel in her eyes when she was a child and then tried to ease the pain with eardrops, hears through her eyes and sees beyond the surface of things in life. She dreams of one day finding that one special love. <PERSON> Elain </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Steenburgen </PERSON> -RRB- returns to <LOCATION> Yazoo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for the contest to give a speech, `` My Life as a Beauty.'' Her wild brother, <PERSON> Delmount </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> -RRB-, has just been released from an insane asylum after <PERSON> Elain </PERSON> committed him for what she saw as his anti-social ways. After a brief stint removing squished animals from highways, he arrives in <LOCATION> Yazoo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to sell the family home. It all comes together on the runway. Selfishness is exposed like an ugly boil; loyality, optimism and honesty glow. <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>, who received a Pulitzer Prize for `` Crimes of the Heart'' in 1981, opened `` Miss Firecracker'' off-Broadway to rave reviews in 1984. She wrote the screenplay for the movie version. In portraits bursting with the magic and eccentricities of the same Southern literary tradition that gave us <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Tennesee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> has created memorable and rich characters. These are real people, not <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> plastics. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> originated the role of <LOCATION> Carnelle </LOCATION> off-Broadway, and is marvelously hyper as the unsophisticated, unassuming beauty hopeful. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> is strangely maniacal but boyish and easy to love. <PERSON> Steenburgen </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, plays magnolia blossom to the hilt and is delicious. But it is <PERSON> Woodard </PERSON> who steals the movie with her lovely innocence as <PERSON> Popeye </PERSON>. We know what love really means. Play this one for the entire family. The language might be a little strong for younger children, but the values are even stronger.

 The Uptown String Quartet -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lesa </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, violins; <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>, viola; <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Folson </PERSON>, Cello. And now for something completely different ... A listener needs a change now and again, and this disc from the Uptown String Quartet is spring cleaning for jaded ears. The name gives a clue _ a marriage of the string quartet with the sounds from far uptown, beyond 110th Street in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. A big shot of jazz, a little rag, a little blues, a lot of Polish. Listen to `` Midnight Child'' and it's evident why the mix is so convincing. The virtuoso note-bending of the blues and gospel singers was born for the violin. So, too, were the strutting rhythms of `` Calvary,'' and doggone if <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> did n't have strings in mind when he wrote `` Easy Winners.'' It helps, too, that the four players are demon fiddlers, whose various experiences include the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION>, `` Dreamgirls,'' the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wynton </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON> and producer <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>'s Double Quartet. Yes, it may seem a little strange, but this is no <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s Ninth for massed accordion band kind of stunt Each of a dozen cuts is perfectly idiomatic, fresh, piquant, just right. The Uptown String Quartet threatens to give crossover recordings a good name. _ By <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Trash'' -LRB- Epic -RRB- _ <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> recently complained that pop music has become moronic, which would mean that <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was way ahead of his time. Happily, two decades after the release of his first record, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> still sounds moronic. `` Trash,'' his latest album, is impossible to take seriously and almost as hard to dislike. Do n't be fooled by the biker sentiments the overwrought <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> spits out over grinding guitars. These tunes are cartoons _ they have more in common with <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnison </PERSON> than <PERSON> Judas </PERSON> <PERSON> Priest </PERSON>. No image is too obvious for <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, which is half the fun. And he shows cleverness in other ways. `` I'll drive you like a hammer on a bed of nails,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> sings. Then the punch line: `` Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.'' The band is head-banger friendly. Guitarist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> nicely frames <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s frenzy, and guest appearances by <PERSON> Aerosmith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovi </PERSON> add to the fun. There are some dead spots, but such hormonal imbalances as `` I'm Your Gun'' and `` This Maniac's in Love With You'' make `` Trash'' the funniest heavy-metal record since Spinal Tap Whether <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> intended it to be that way is really immaterial. _ By <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<TEXT>
 French filmmaker <PERSON> Jean-Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON> recently talked about why he has spent the last 10 years making three highly original films, `` Quest for Fire,'' `` The Name of the Rose'' and `` The Bear.'' `` I always see audiences begging for something different,'' he said. `` It's difficult to make something different today. Many films have been made, and there are many good filmmakers around. To bring something fresh to the screen is difficult, let's face it. `` This is what pushes me. It's so pleasant seeing people come out of the cinema having the impression that they discovered something new. They are happily surprised, and I think that's a great reward.'' `` The Bear'' is unquestionably different. Based on the old <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Curwood </PERSON> novel `` The Grizzly King,'' it tells the battles of a small cub and a huge male bear against hunters and nature. The film already has grossed more than $ 100 million in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The large part of the battle is to explain to the public the nature of this film. It's an entertainment. It's not documentary. It's not the old-fashioned Disney animal picture. It's not a wilderness picture,'' he said. `` When I tell people my last film is about two bears, they're convinced it's for kids It's not a National Geographic -LRB- television -RRB- special. How can I explain to people that it is something that they have not seen _ yet? Fortunately when I arrived here, the Hollywood Reporter said it was similar to ` E.T.' Thank you.'' <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON>'s history with `` The Bear'' dates back to 1981, when he had finished his prehistoric adventure, `` Quest for Fire.'' He fell in love with <PERSON> Curwood </PERSON>'s book, then was sidetracked by `` The Name of the Rose.'' `` The Bear'' was launched in 1986. <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON>, himself a bear of a man with curly, graying hair and a charming accent, plunged himself into the new project, exploring locations, checking out bear trainers, steeping himself in animal behavior. `` The Bear'' was filmed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Dolomites from May 18, 1987, to the following Sept. 21. The difficulties with animals, weather and managing a 200-person crew were enormous, but <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON> was exhilarated by his actors. `` Bears are very fascinating animals,'' he said. `` They are as intelligent as dogs, but they have something dogs do not: They spend a lot of their time standing up. Because of that, there is immediate identification with human beings. `` Take a lion. A fascinating animal, but it remains a beast. A bear is a beast in the four-leg version. Very hairy. Very noisy. It's fascinating, he's so powerful. Suddenly, he stands up -LRB- <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON> demonstrates, bearlike -RRB-. The front legs look like arms. They use their paws like arms. Their claws like fingers. If you see a bear eat an apple, it's just like a human.'' The two principals were played by <PERSON> Bart </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Zoo grizzly trained by <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Seus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and Douce -LRB- `` sweet'' -RRB-, a cub from a French zoo. Were there days when the two stars simply did n't want to act? `` Of course,'' said the director. `` Any star you work with has bad days. Stars are very temperamental. So are bears. You can not push them. In any case, I would not advise a director to push a star. A star must be happy in front of the camera _ especially when they are bears and they can kill you if you're not. `` I swear that if you try to get something from an animal who is not in a good mood, not only will you not get it that day, you will never get it. What you have to do is organize the set so the animal will be happy with its own instincts, digging in its own nature to discover what it would do in such a circumstance. He would in effect rewrite the script.'' He cited the example of a scene in which the grizzly scratches its back on a tree. The scene took days of preparation: finding a tree with rough bark, laying a cement platform at the base and covering it with moss, surrounding the tree with rocks, putting sand on the bear's back so it would itch. A few seconds on the screen, the scene took a day to shoot. `` My first concern with the film was that no animal would get hurt,'' said <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON>. `` Second concern, although there is no Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Technicians nor Actors _ because they're not endangered species _ I was very worried about working every day with those enormous monsters.'' He became more worried toward the end of shooting because no incidents had occurred. One girl had tried to remove her finger from the cub's mouth and nearly lost her finger when the cub bit down. The only other casualty was <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON> himself. He `` foolishly'' posed for photographs with <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> in the cage. Like some stars in the past, <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> turned on his director in a bad mood `` and decided to kill me.'' <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON> followed the safety instruction of playing dead when menaced, and <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> retreated. A scene that amazes previewers comes when <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> roars at hunter Tcheky Karyo at close range on a mountain ledge. It's the real thing, the director assured. Bear and actor were a few feet apart, but Karyo had the option of leaping to a net 30 feet below. `` The Bear'' credits list <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s Creature Shop as creators of `` animatronic bears.'' But <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON> assured that the <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> fakes were used only for battle scenes. `` <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s contribution was to avoid putting the animals in any situation where they were at risk,'' said <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON>. `` For instance, I have a fight between bears and dogs. As long as there is no body contact, there is a real bear. But when you see the dogs biting the fur, you do n't need a real bear. But the fur needs life in it, so that was where <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> came in.'' The same with a fight between the cub and a puma. His next project? `` I do n't know. Even though ` The Bear' is a success in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, I want to see how it does here. My films have not been terribly successful here. I hope that will change.''

 <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozyreff </PERSON> lives with one of a museum's worst dilemmas: to exhibit a treasure is to see it slowly fade into oblivion. To avoid such loss, <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>' Museum of Art and History, where <PERSON> Kozyreff </PERSON> heads the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> department, has had to keep its 7,542 Japanese woodcut prints mostly under lock since it began collecting them a century ago. To preserve the original coloring and sharpness of the 17th to 19th century prints, they have long been shielded from daylight _ and visitors _ in a cavernous room. There the collection remained, unknown but to a few cognoscenti. For the Europalia-Japan art festival this fall, however, <PERSON> Kozyreff </PERSON> has allowed 1,000 of the light-sensitive prints to go on a unique display until December in the Beaux-Arts Palace of <LOCATION> Charleroi </LOCATION>, 31 miles south of <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. `` Some of the prints have never been shown in public before and some may never be shown again,'' said <PERSON> Kozyreff </PERSON>. The occasion has not been wasted on the critics, who got a glimpse of the works of such masters as <PERSON> Katsushika </PERSON> <PERSON> Hokusai </PERSON>, <PERSON> Toshusai </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharaku </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Harunobu </PERSON>, all exhuming a rare freshness in hue. `` A universe of elegance of refinement,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Gazet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antwerpen </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, lauding the nature scenes, portraits of Kabuki theater actors and glimpses of geishas. `` You just will not believe your eyes,'' praised <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Standaard </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> daily added that the Japanese prints show was the best of 33 exhibits in the <LOCATION> Europalia </LOCATION> festival, which is expected to draw more than 1.7 million visitors during its three-month run. Every fortnight, 200 different prints will be put under the dimmed lights of the Beaux-Arts Palace. The rotation will limit damage to the works. Light changes the pigments of the ink and makes the old paper wither. `` If you show it permanently, it disappears,'' said <PERSON> Kozyreff </PERSON>. Comparing it to a tree leaf in fall, she said, `` if you leave it in the open, it will shrivel. `` Anyway, even looking at 200 stamps in one session is too much. You can only concentrate on some 60 or it gets to be too much.'' But one man who could n't get enough was <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Michotte </PERSON>, a Belgian businessman who a century ago had a huge appetite for all things Japanese. When <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> broke out of its isolation in the latter part of the 19th century, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was stunned to discover such a rich artistic culture. Soon the first woodcut prints arrived in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and were enthusiastically received. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> was so impressed he made a series of paintings of prints. <PERSON> Michotte </PERSON> managed to select the best woodcut prints before they even came off the boats and had amassed a superb collection by the turn of the century. In 1904 he wrote: `` The Japanese gave up the finest of their art riches to foreigners. The products left for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> by the hundred thousands.'' Because they were not unique pieces, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> did not consider the prints national treasures. Prints from one woodcut could range in numbers from a few hundred to a couple of thousand, but only the first few had a perfect sharpness. Soon the market was exhausted. Today the best woodcut prints are limited to some 20 collections worldwide. Apart from <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, two of the best collections outside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and the Art Institute of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The prints have now become so rare that a Sharaku recently fetched $ 345,000 at an auction. In 1905, <PERSON> Michotte </PERSON> sold his 4,666 prints to the Museum of Art and History. The museum slowly added to that over the years. The <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> collection stands out for its extraordinary sharpness in lines and richness in colors. Even in <PERSON> Michotte </PERSON>'s days, experts charged the colors were so fresh his prints had to be fakes. It was not until 1970 before experts confirmed their authenticity beyond doubt, <PERSON> Kozyreff </PERSON> said. Many of the woodcuts are only known because <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> has the one remaining print.

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON> is a soft-spoken man. He'll sit and talk about his music, chain-smoking Winstons and grinning when most people laugh, but he'd probably prefer to hand over his first album and let it talk for him Since his LP, `` Too Long in the Wasteland,'' came out in August, he's been barraged by journalists looking for a story on the talented songwriter and son of a talented author. His writing has been compared to that of his father _ author <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON> -LRB- `` Lonesome Dove,'' `` The Last Picture Show'' -RRB- _ and he's been compared to more than a few musicians. He's heard it all: <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> with a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accent, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Knopfler </PERSON> with more of a country feel, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> with a softer cynicism, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> with a major record deal. But he's actually just <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON> with a guitar who takes it all in typical <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> stride, flattered but not pressured. `` Style is a retrospective thing,'' he said recently, leaning against the headboard of a motel bed. `` If my songs are getting across then I'm doing my job.'' `` <PERSON> James </PERSON> is only 26 years old, but he writes like he's lived a lifetime,'' said musician <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cougar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellencamp </PERSON>, who produced the album for <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON>'s father sent <PERSON> Mellencamp </PERSON> a tape of his son's songs while the pair worked on a screenplay. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON> comes from a schooled background _ his father, a Pulitzer Prize-winner, and his mother, an English teacher at the University of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. He spent most of his childhood in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> while his father taught at <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and in <LOCATION> Archer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. His father gave him a guitar when he was 7, and his mother made him learn to play it `` when she got tired of hearing me bang on the thing.'' During his approximately four years at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON> gradually became more interested in performing at the nearby Saw Mill Cafe in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> than in schoolwork. At least one icon from his English classes made an impression, though. If listeners do n't get the reference in the title song, there's an apology in the liner notes to T.S. <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON>, who wrote the celebrated poem `` The Wasteland.'' `` I always liked <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON> said. `` I liked the way he twisted those words around.'' The songs on `` Too Long in the Wasteland'' fly by like an aimless drive from one end of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to the other, and back again. <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON>'s deadpan delivery provides the travelogue. He muses about poor fools going through the motions in `` Painting by Numbers,'' tells the story of a teen gone bad and trying to go good in `` <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>,'' goes home and wonders if he ought to leave the motor running in `` Outskirts'' and `` Poor Lost Soul,'' and hangs around shooting the breeze in `` Talkin' at the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>.'' The last song, lamenting small-town life, comes closest to the work of his father. It calls on <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON>'s experiences in <LOCATION> Archer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, long a wealth of creative inspiration for <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON>: `` Who you lookin' for, what was his name, you can probably find him at the football game,'' <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON> sings, a chorus of questionable-sounding comrades swelling the background vocals. `` It's a small town, know what I mean, it's a small town and we all support the team.'' `` The words are work unless you accidentally come up with something that fits,'' he explained. `` I usually stumble onto a line, write it down, and start from the line. There's no pre-arranged story.'' At least one song comes straight from <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON>'s life. He got the idea for `` Shining Eyes,'' a face-the-facts song about a relationship in trouble, from an episode with his girlfriend, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>. He was having a serious heart-to-heart with <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> on the phone upstairs at a rare book store in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I heard the phone ringing downstairs, and I just let it ring. That's where that line comes from, ` when a telephone rings in an empty room.''' But unlike the song, which ends in wistful ambivalence, <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON> married <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> a few weeks ago. While he's on the road she's in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, where the couple have a house. <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON> started out playing songs by <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromberg </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, and after tending bar and playing in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, he was encouraged by a friend to enter the Kerrville Folk Festival in 1987. He was one of six winners that year and met songwriter <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Koller </PERSON>, who told him to stop by if he ever made it to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON> did and they cut some songs, one of which was considered for the soundtrack for his father's `` Lonesome Dove'' miniseries, `` but they decided they did n't want any words,'' <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON> said. By then, <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON>'s father had given the tape to <PERSON> Mellencamp </PERSON>, and after a few months of writing, <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON> had enough songs to go into the studio. He tries to stay away from the business side of the industry and focus on his music. And as far as he's concerned, the people at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have been very accommodating. `` They must think I'm a draw now,'' he grinned. `` They have n't told me to cut my hair or dress in leopard skins or anything. <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON> wants to finish his road trip _ he's been touring since August, and will quit just before Christmas _ and then try to put some songs on paper and then on wax. But he still remembers a long-term goal, one he set when he was banging on the guitar his father gave him. He laughs about it, but it carries a bit of truth at the same time. `` I wanted to grow up to be <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The Inspiration of Lobbies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> is n't writing, he lobbies. Actually, he sits in lobbies _ hotel lobbies, and especially, movie lobbies. The author likes watching people buy tickets and walk inside. On a cold day, he appreciates the smell and warmth of the popcorn maker and coffee machine. And in his beloved Savoy Theater in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, there's a book left out for suggestions. So hotels and movie houses appear often in his work, which includes the 1987 novel `` Northern Lights,'' nominated for the National Book Award, and the recently published `` Kiss in the Hotel <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> -LRB- Summit, $ 18.95 -RRB-, a collection of short stories. `` In lobbies, one lives in a pure state of expectation,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, 40. `` You're in between. You're sort of safe. You have n't been disappointed yet by anything that has happened `` You're off the street. It has something to do with being protected and not responsible but being able to observe and take everything in.'' Lobbies are like sneak previews for <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, opportunities for eavesdropping and observation. In his stories, lobbies are where young lovers meet, old ones reunite and former actresses recapture their past. In the title story of `` Kiss in the Hotel <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>,'' a man spends his entire life drifting from lobby to lobby as he pursues an unrequited love from his youth, a woman who worked a kissing booth during World War II. `` I was trying to show how one single event can consume a person. Just seeing a woman and making that person your entire life without any rhyme or reason except for an emotional one,'' he said. `` I did n't want to psychologize too much in these stories. It's a conscious effort to take yourself out of the story You always tell young writers, ` Show, do n't tell.''' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, had traveled extensively in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as a writer for wildlife magazines and learned the native languages well enough to produce three collections of translated works. The death of a friend helped inspire `` Northern Lights,'' in which a teen-age boy, <PERSON> Noah </PERSON>, shuttles between a broken home in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and life in <LOCATION> Quill </LOCATION>, a northern <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> settlement where his best friend, <PERSON> Pelly </PERSON>, has been killed in a freak accident. The seasons are important in `` Northern Lights.'' Summers, the time for experience, are spent in <LOCATION> Quill </LOCATION>. As the days shorten and winter arrives, <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> returns home. `` In summer you're out and time seems to be totally open to you,'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> said. `` Everything seems possible. `` Winter seems to have direct conflicts in terms of your sense of time. It closes you in, you have to bundle up. One's moods are more acute. These characters seem to be very moody characters.'' The novel's title is derived, naturally, from a movie theater that <PERSON> Noah </PERSON>'s mother purchases with the hope of bringing the family together. In `` Whatever <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Wants </PERSON>,'' a story from <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s new book, movies at the Moonlight drive-in theater shine on falling snow. `` I've worked in two movie theaters, one when I was 16 and one in college,'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> said. `` The first time I went to work in a movie theater I thought that's what I'd be doing. I saw it as a possible occupation. So I guess in that sense there was a domestic aspect to it.'' Disappointment, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> said, is another important part of his work. Not just unrequited love, but the loss of innocence, the inability to enjoy life without complications. In `` Whatever <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Wants </PERSON>,'' the title character is a former actress from the 1940s who persuades her husband to show one of her old films, `` White Savage,'' at the Moonlight. Watching the film, in which she is captured by cannibals, <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> sadly reflects on dreams long faded: `` That scene when the camera is on me, just before the cannibals arrive. Just by campfire light that way, with everything about my face and character calm and brave and just right. When I was a girl, that's who I wanted to be.'' The friendship of <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pelly </PERSON> in `` Northern Lights'' is written with the same longing for simplicity. `` I thought of how at that age you have a friendship without what happens later when you start to psychologize,'' the author said. `` The kind of friendship you have at that age, which is why coming-of-age novels are fundamentally of such interest to people. `` Those friendships are unlike anything you have later. You're almost entirely relating on an emotional level to the other person You're just interested in his company. You are n't alone.'' But for <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, the teen-ager's desire for companionship has given way to a writer's need for privacy, even in a crowded lobby. `` It has something to do with the fact that as you get older, you feel your time is less your own,'' he said. `` You have responsibilities, like money, no matter how isolated you're living. Your time is precious. `` You can live vicariously in a hotel lobby like the Algonquin. You watch people come and go, just sit in the lobby and totally live a vicarious existence.''

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> `` Crash'' <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON>, who had a litany of hits in the 1970s, but who gave up making records in 1981, has returned with an album aptly titled `` Back on Track.'' After releasing such hits as `` Knock Three Times,'' `` Rub It In,'' `` Easy as Pie'' and `` Broken Down in Tiny Pieces,'' <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON> quit the studio to ponder his future and keep an eye on his bank balance. Nicknamed for his crashing style of play in high school football, he kept active by making personal appearances. He signed with <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> and `` Back on Track'' is his first recording for the label. He wo n't go into detail about his problems, but he was a party to a lawsuit involving the country group <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON> was a co-owner of a booking agency that promoted concerts by the award-winning four-piece band. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and the agency became embroiled in a $ 3 million suit over commissions. The matter was settled out of court in 1987 and the terms were never announced. `` Nobody ever needs to be in a lawsuit,'' <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON> said. `` Everything is cool now. Nobody wins in a lawsuit. It's going to hurt you one way or another. You may win one way but it's going to hurt you in another. `` When you are involved in a lawsuit, you've got other things on your mind when you try to do a road show. You ca n't get your mind on recording. So I backed away a little. `` When you have certain problems, you kind of feel rejected. I did n't know whether to retire or make another stab at it. I kind of wanted people to accept me again. I was n't sure if they would or not.'' His version of `` Knock Three Times'' in 1971 ignited a string of nine No. 1 records and 20 others that reached the Top 10 of the country charts. He took <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON>'s pop version of the song, added fiddles and came up with a country alternative that made the tune one of the most heard of its time. In his heyday, <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON> gave one of the most dynamic concerts in country music. Clad in form-fitting outfits, he gyrated across the stage and flirted with fans. His show has n't changed much, as he does up-tempo songs, ballads and a rock' n' roll medley of old tunes. His followers have remained loyal. The first single released from <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON>'s comeback album is `` Just Another Miserable Day -LRB- Here in Paradise -RRB-,'' which is about a man in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> separated from his lover. Other cuts include his version of the <ORGANIZATION> Hank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sr. </ORGANIZATION> hit `` I Ca n't Help It -LRB- If I'm Still in Love With You -RRB-'' and the nostalgic `` The Girls That Everybody Knew,'' whose lyrics rattle off the names of girls mentioned in hit songs down through the years -LRB- <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> -RRB- `` I think we're headed in the right direction now,'' he said. `` I do n't think it -LRB- the recording hiatus -RRB- hurt too much because we've been traveling lots of days and the fans have still been coming out.''

<HEAD>T-Shirts: $10 Billion Business in `Wearable Art'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Do n't call them T-shirts. `` Imprinted sportswear'' is the language preferred these days in a $ 10 billion business that has its roots in the tie-dyed 1960s. `` It started ... when people found out you could take a T-shirt and put a message on it,'' said <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Anglin </PERSON>, general merchandise manager for Waco-based Plus Companies, which owns the nation's largest chain of retail T-shirt stores Screen printers, monogrammers and applique-makers vied with clothing manufacturers, distributors and designers for attention at the Imprinted Sportswear Convention here last week. About 6,000 people attended the convention, which featured displays ranging from neon-bright shirts and shorts to basic black and white shirts. Decorations included fabric paint, sequins, foil transfers and various trinkets. Officials said 1.6 billion T-shirts were sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year, with more than 20 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> shoppers buying 10 or more shirts. <PERSON> Anglin </PERSON> estimated that 90 percent of the T-shirt business is in shirts and other articles priced from $ 15 to $ 35 and imprinted with everything from favorite colleges to rock groups to cartoon characters _ <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> and <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> are big this year _ to free-form designs with `` tons of glitz.'' `` T-shirts have moved up to high fashion and high profits,'' <PERSON> Anglin </PERSON> said. `` A dollar's worth of trim should yield up to five times the original value of the shirt.'' For <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> Calabrese </PERSON>, a design consultant for <ORGANIZATION> Transfermania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, clothing is a canvas for wearable art. <PERSON> Calabrese </PERSON>, said he once used transfers to create a $ 900 evening dress and spends much time looking for new things to stick on clothes. `` Right now, I'm looking at a fabric developed out of cork,'' he said. And yes, tie-dye is back, meaning hipsters of 25 years ago can impress their children. Upon seeing an old tie-dyed shirt, <PERSON> Anglin </PERSON> said his 20-year-old daughter was dumbfounded. `` I had no idea you were so cool,'' she told him. <PERSON> Calabrese </PERSON> said imprinted clothing _ shoes, jackets, caps or T-shirts that become dresses _ allows individuality. `` People are very much into doing their own thing these days,'' he said, echoing the tie-dyed era.

 The dollar was slightly higher in calm trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> early today and dealers said they expected little movement in the currency until the publication of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth figures on Thursday. Gold prices moved lower. The dollar was fluctuating in a narrow range between 1.85 and 1.86 West German marks, and likely would stay there until the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product estimates for the third quarter, dealers said. `` The bulls and bears are in balance, so I do n't see major changes until Thursday,'' said <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Manderbach </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Norddeutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Landesbank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girozentrale </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Another dealer, at a European bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, said: `` It's very sluggish right now ... A trend in one or the other direction should crystallize after the -LRB- GNP -RRB- figures.'' Economists expected the third-quarter growth rate to be little changed from its moderate 2.5 percent in the second quarter, but some traders anticipated a sharp slowdown. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 142.40 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at a higher rate of 142.47 yen.

<HEAD>New Employee-Management Bid Reported Near</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A labor-management group is considering a revised buyout offer for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that would give employees a majority stake in the airline holding company and leave some stock in public hands, the Wall Street Journal reported today. The Journal said the group is seeking reactions to the new deal, valued at $ 225 to $ 240 a share, or about $ 5.09 billion. To avoid the risk of rejection, the group does n't plan to formally present the plan at a <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board meeting today, the newspaper said. Instead, the bidding group will seek binding commitments from banks covering all the money needed to finance the buyout before making a formal proposal, the Journal said. The group has n't fully developed the idea yet or discussed it with banks, according to the Journal. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said the employee-management group intends to submit a revised proposal to the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board at today's meeting. Representatives of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s top management, pilots and flight attendants prepared a proposal over the weekend and will present it at today's board meeting, the papers reported in today's editions. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> newspapers said the bid is in the range of $ 220 to $ 250 a share. Such an offer would be substantially lower than the $ 6.75 billion, or $ 300-a-share, offer the board accepted in September. That leveraged buyout collapsed when it failed to get necessary bank financing. The original deal would have given management and labor an 85 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> under the largest employee buyout in corporate history. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> would have taken a 15 percent ownership stake in return for a $ 750 million investment. After the deal's financing fell through on Oct. 13, sparking a rout on Wall Street and a 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average, uncertainty surrounding the situation caused <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> to pull out. No new investor has been found to replace the foreign carrier, all three newspapers reported. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> reportedly approached potential lenders last week, offering higher interest rates and loan fees. The bank has not, however, offered term sheets, the written terms that must first be approved by the buyout group. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s directors have a difficult decision to make, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> shares last week lost 40 percent of their value, or $ 111.25. On Friday <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 168.50. A significantly lower bid might be hard for shareholders to swallow, particularly those who bought shares for $ 250 or more. If the directors accept a lower offer, they could be vulnerable to shareholder lawsuits, analysts said. But if they reject the offer, a corporate raider might buy up low-priced <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock and then seek stockholder consent to oust the board. An alternative, some say, is a partial financial restructuring giving shareholders a large cash dividend and securities. Such a plan would give employees a sizable stake, if not a majority, in the company.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with harvest pressure offsetting the positive impact of new export sales. The corn market fell after opening nearly unchanged, surprising analysts who had expected a higher opening based on the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement late Friday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had bought 2.8 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn. The confirmation brought to more than 7.8 million metric tons the total amount of corn purchased by Soviets since the new crop year began Sept. 1. `` The question from here is, are they going to buy more or are we pretty well done,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Biedermann </PERSON>, director of research with <ORGANIZATION> Allendale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a futures brokerage in <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` That's why we're kind of stalled here.'' Further selling was linked to the fine harvest weather that occurred in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> over the weekend and is predicted for the region through Friday. In early trading, wheat futures were 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 2.41 a bushel; corn futures were -LCB- cent to 2 cents lower with December at $ 2.41 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent lower to \ cent higher with December at $ 1.44 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents lower to 3 -LCB- cents higher with November at $ 5.62 a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after Friday's <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report showing fewer cattle on feed than the market had expected. Live cattle futures were .22 cent to .68 cent higher with December at 75.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .65 cent higher with October at 83 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent lower to .45 cent higher with December at 47.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .07 cent lower to .18 cent higher with February at 52.95 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled lower on Friday while pork futures advanced.

<HEAD>Exxon's Third-Quarter Earnings Dip 9 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today its third-quarter profit fell 9 percent due mainly to a $ 373 million stock repurchase and lower refining and marketing earnings. Costs associated with the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill did not affect third-quarter results, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said, although the company continued cleanup efforts during the period. For the three-month period ended Sept. 30, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings totaled $ 1.11 billion, or 87 cents a share, down from $ 1.23 billion, or 93 cents a share in the comparable 1988 period. Revenue rose 8 percent to $ 23.66 billion from $ 21.89 billion a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said the repurchase of more than 8 million shares of its stock for $ 373 million contributed to the lower results. In addition, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign refining and marketing earnings declined by $ 180 million during the quarter, although they remained above those of the second period. Chemicals earnings also declined, while interest expense increased due mainly to the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s Canadian subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. For the first nine months, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings fell 34.5 percent to $ 2.54 billion, or $ 1.99 a share, from $ 3.88 billion, or $ 2.89 a share The lower nine-month earnings reflected the company's provision for the March 24 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> spill in which the supertanker Exxon Valdez crashed into a reef, spewing millions of gallons into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> A special provision in the second quarter for expenses and insurance claims stemming from the spill reduced its net income by $ 850 million, or 67 cents a share. Without the provision, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said its net income for the first nine months would have been $ 3.4 billion, or $ 2.68 a share. Revenue for the nine months rose to $ 69.51 billion from $ 65.52 billion a year earlier.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its profits fell 35 percent in the third quarter because of softening prices for some of its chemical products. Net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $ 139 million, or 98 cents per share, compared with $ 213 million, or $ 1.56 per share, in the third quarter of 1988. Consolidated sales for the quarter rose 2 percent to $ 2.14 billion from $ 2.11 billion, due mainly to an increase in sales in the company's industrial gases industry segment. Union Carbide said the increase helped offset reduced sales in chemicals and plastics. Overall operating profit was $ 331 million, a 23 percent decline from $ 430 million in the third quarter in 1988. Union Carbide said prices for polyethylene and ethylene oxide and glocyols continued to soften in the third quarter, causing the drop in net income. Earnings for the first nine months were $ 526 million, or $ 3.74 a share, up 5 percent from $ 501 million, or $ 3.71 a share, in the same period last year. Nine month sales rose to $ 6.66 billion from $ 6.19 billion.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 1980s have been financially successful years for millions of Americans, but they also have been years of repeated warnings about great financial collapses and recessions to come. There has been little sense of security, almost no comfort in material achievement, because of the constant threats that all could disappear in a wink. The economy was prone to earthquakes. Hundreds of `` experts'' said so. One reason for the sense of insecurity has been the problem of debt _ of personal, business, municipal, state, federal, international debt, the multibillion-dollar likes of which had never been seen before. Debts on houses, debts on cars, debts to Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, education debts, credit card debts, debts to the Japanese, uncollectable debts owed by Third World nations to big Western banks. Easy credit, it was said, was undermining human and financial values. In such an atmosphere of fear, some critics went to extremes. They reasoned that if everyone is screaming, they have to scream even louder to make a point. Nothing short of total collapse could get a listener's attention. It led to `` The Coming'' style of analysis _ the coming <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Depression </LOCATION>, the coming collapse in home prices, the coming banking disaster, the coming great inflation, the coming interest-rate surge, the coming decline of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. So, where have those coming events gone? Oddly, some of them might already have taken place, not in their ultimate, extreme, catastrophic form, but in smaller doses. The big quake did n't occur, but there have been many sizable, lesser tremors. The financial system has n't collapsed in its entirety, for example, but repeatedly there have been large and painful financial disasters. Thousands of farmers lost their land in the decade, many of them after violating their own conservative beliefs. They borrowed money and bought land at inflated prices. Some of that land fell to a third of its purchase price. Some of the richest, most independent, glamorous entrepreneurs the country has ever produced were wiped out when crude oil prices collapsed. Their buddies in real estate speculation went down with them. Simultaneously, commercial banks were forced to write off billions of dollars in debt to the less developed nations, after making loans that almost everyone in the nation except bankers knew were overly risky. Savings and loan institutions collapsed, at a cost to the country of scores of billions of dollars. Junk bond deals have fallen apart, wiping away billions in paper profits. The stock market has collapsed twice in two years. Who said there have n't been financial and economic earthquakes? <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> economist, who does n't allow such terrible events to lead to despair, calls attention to some positive considerations. Assets well exceed debts, for example, and savings continue to exceed credit demands. Moreover, personal savings are now rising. What about the coming recession? Well, to some extent that too might have happened. It was n't officially recorded as a recession, but conceivably it could some day be recognized as such. It occurred in mid-1986, when by some statistical measurements there might have been more than 30 states in recession. Offsetting this, however, were booms on the coasts. In national statistics, the booms hid the busts. The `` recession'' of 1986 did n't go altogether unrecorded. In the second quarter of 1986 there was a decided decline in economic activity, but official figures still recorded gross national product as expanding. Two years later the government revised the reading to show a loss. Meanwhile, the government also revised third-quarter numbers. In 1987 they revised downward the GNP reading for that 1986 quarter, and they revised it lower again in 1988 _ and again in 1989. Next year, it could show a loss. Two quarterly losses of gross national product constitute at least one definition of recession. But if we had one in 1986, we probably wo n't know it until 1990. In short, the total catastrophes might not have occurred, but there have been several lesser shocks. It leaves us to ask the question: Did these shocks relieve pressure, or are they precursors of the Big One?

Excluding onetime charges, the company said net income from its aerospace business rose 34 percent to $ 55 million while net income from its engineered materials business rose 4.8 percent to $ 66 million. However, the company reported net income from its automotive operations fell to $ 11 million this year from $ 33 million last year, excluding onetime charges. It blamed overall declines in original equipmnmet car and trucks sales, increased investment in anti-lock brake systems, unfavorable foreign exchange conversion and an unusually low effective tax rate last year. `` We foresee continued strength in both our aerospace and engineered materials businesses and a rebound in our automotive operations,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the company's chairman and chief executive officer. For the first nine months, <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 413 million, or $ 2.77 a share, up 15 percent from $ 359 million, or $ 2.40 per share, a year earlier. Nine-month revenue slipped to $ 8.88 billion from $ 8.90 billion a year earlier.

 Share prices closed modestly higher Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, in the lightest volume so far this year, ahead of Tuesday's release of British trade figures for September. Dealers said the day's modest gains signaled some support for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> equities. They pegged the support largely to anticipation that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s trade imbalance can not be much worse than the near-record deficits seen in July and August. But the very light volume reflected nervousness, dealers said. Volume was 276.8 million shares, breaking the year's previous low of 280.5 million shares recorded on Sept. 25. Last Friday, 351.3 million shares changed hands. `` It's a case of the market being too high to buy and too afraid to sell,'' said a senior dealer with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's better to wait.'' The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 10.6 points, or 0.5 percent, higher at 2,189.7. The index opened at a session low of 2,179.5 and rose to a high of 2,195.9 shortly before Wall Street opened on a slightly weak note.

 Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed narrowly mixed Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with prices for near-month corn and wheat deliveries supported by export demand and other contracts weakened by harvest pressure. Indications that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was seeking to buy 330,000 metric tons of subsidized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat prompted buying of December wheat futures, analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s confirmation last Friday of a sale of 2.8 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> helped to limit losses in the December corn market. The confirmation brought to more than 7.8 million metric tons the total amount of corn purchased by the Soviets for delivery in the new crop year, which began Sept. 1. Contracts for deferred delivery of corn finished moderately lower on selling linked to forecasts for continued good harvesting weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report released after the close of trading showed a 20 percent increase in the amount of wheat inspected for export last week compared with the previous week, while corn and soybean inspections were little changed.

<HEAD>Bankers Trust Posts $1.42 Billion Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday posted a third-quarter loss of $ 1.42 billion, confirming an amount revealed recently when <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> announced a big boost in its loan-loss reserve to cover problem debt. The loss for the three months ended Sept. 30 came to $ 17.39 a share and compared with a profit of $ 162.1 million, or $ 2.01 a share, in 1988's third quarter. Last week the New York-based bank holding company said it was making a $ 1.6 billion special addition to its provision for potentially bad Third World loans, joining a long list of major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks that have bolstered their reserves. The special addition raised Bankers Trust's allowance for credit losses to $ 2.91 billion, or 14 percent of total loans on Sept. 30. If it had n't set aside the additional funds, <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> would have earned $ 180 million, or $ 2.18 a share, in the third quarter, up $ 17.9 mlilion or 11 percent from a year earlier. Bankers Trust Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said that apart from the loan-loss provision, third-quarter results benefited from higher noninterest revenue and a lower effective tax rate. These were partially offset by increases in noninterest expenses and provisions for debts _ other than the special addition. Noninterest revenue totaled $ 505 million in the third quarter, up $ 57.7 million or 13 percent from a year earlier. Higher fees and commissions plus increases in trust and custodian revenue contributed to the overall gain in noninterest revenue. A decline in revenue, however, partially offset the increases. Revenue fell $ 33.7 million to $ 82.3 million. The effective tax rate was 18 percent in the third quarter compared with 31 percent in the third 1988 quarter. Total noninterest expenses were $ 470.5 million, up $ 54.4 million or 13 percent over 1988. For the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 1.08 billion, or $ 13.27 a share, compared with earnings of $ 462.2 million, or $ 5.80 a share, a year earlier. Excluding the third-quarter loan-loss provision, nine-month earnings would have been $ 518.9 million, $ 6.34 a share, up $ 56.7 million or 12 percent from the first three quarters of 1988.

 <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its third-quarter earnings climbed 29 percent from a year earlier, citing significantly higher revenue at its <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, its TV stations and the <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> cable network. The company, which also has interests in radio and publishing, said it earned $ 80.8 million, or $ 4.56 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with $ 62.6 million, or $ 3.55 a share, a year earlier. Third-quarter revenue rose 9 percent to $ 1.10 billion from $ 1.01 billion a year earlier. Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said stronger advertising demand boosted revenue at the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION>, the company's eight TV stations and the 80 percent-owned <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> cable network. Operating income rose 14 percent to $ 157.3 million, as income from broadcasting rose 18 percent and publishing edged up 1 percent. The TV stations and <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> reported significant increases in operating earnings, while higher program and news-gathering costs moderated the earnings improvement at the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hopes to get an inside look at how the federal government handled the recent stock market plunge when two key officials testify at separate hearings this week. On Wednesday, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel is slated to hear from <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, in his first congressional appearance since the market slid more than 190 points on Friday, Oct. 13. The following day, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is to appear before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Banking, <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The hearings were scheduled before the stock market's Oct. 13 decline, but that market drop and continuing concern about another crash like the one in October 1987 are expected to overshadow both sessions. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., has told <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> the stock plunge `` adds new and compelling impetus to your testimony. He asked <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> and his staff to reconstruct what happened during the selloff for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s telecommunications and finance subcommittee, which <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> chairs Legislation is pending in both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would expand the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s powers to monitor the markets in several ways, some of them opposed by various segments of the industry. The market reforms were proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> after the stock market crash in 1987. The ones that have sparked controversy include giving the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> authority to request reports on large securities and options trades to track who's trading what to whom. Another would requires rules for assessing the financial soundness of holding companies that are the parent companies of broker dealers. In congressional testimony earlier this month, the heads of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> supported those changes, but the president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON>, had some reservations. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that the trade group `` is opposed to both bills, as written, but we are hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s goals.'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> is expected to spell out the <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION>'s position at Wednesday's hearing before <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>'s subcommittee. In addition to <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> and <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON>, chairman of the Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of mutual funds also is to testify on proposed market reforms. But the main topic is expected to be Wall Street's Friday the 13th. That's when the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial companies' stocks, a key market indicator, plunged 190.58 points in the final hours of trading Many nervously compared the drop to October 1987 when Dow fell more than 100 points on a Friday before plummeting a record 508 points in the Black Monday crash. This time around the market rebounded, closing up 88.12 points a week ago Monday. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> officials, headed by <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, worked to restore calm over the weekend while quietly conferring with the exchanges, various government agencies and foreign trading partners. Some Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, however, say it's time to re-examine changes recommended, but never implemented, by a presidential task force headed by <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> before he took the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> post. `` Recent events have indicated the need to review the recommendations of the <ORGANIZATION> Brady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>,'' Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> will be the sole witness before that committee Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Brady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> proposed having one agency coordinate regulation of all financial markets. The plan never was implemented by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Then and now, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> oversaw stock and options markets, the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regulated futures markets and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> set stock margins and supervised the payments system among banks and brokerage houses. The market reforms proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> include giving the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> chairman the authority to halt trading for up to 24 hours in emergencies. Currently, only the president can order such a shutdown. But <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> has said he does not want that power and does not think it should be exercised. In written answers to questions during <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> post, <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said such authority would create too much uncertainty about when the markets would close and for how long. `` In a crisis, this uncertainty and the related rumors concerning its likelihood could have seriously adverse consequences,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Erstwhile Buyer of MGM-UA Announces Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Resort-entertainment company <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, hurt by financial problems including the collapse of its $ 1.5 billion deal to buy <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, announced a broad restructuring Monday aimed at generating hundreds of millions of dollars in savings and asset sales. The announcement came after the Australian <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> suspended trading in <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> because the company had n't answered an exchange question about its loans, investments and deposits to <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affiliate. Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from creditors late Thursday under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code. The filing gives the company a repreive from creditors while it works out a way to pay debts. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION>, a Sydney-based operator of resorts and television stations, plans to sell its remaining 51 percent stake in Mirage resorts in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, said Chairman <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Skase </PERSON>. <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> said in a news release that the company also will accelerate plans to sell its <LOCATION> Adelaide </LOCATION> television station in southern <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and two regional stations in <LOCATION> Queensland </LOCATION>. The sales are expected to generate more than 600 million Australian dollars, or about $ 460 million, reduce interest costs and eliminate other financial liabilities, <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> intends to retain a long-term management contract on the resorts to generate fee income. In March, <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> sold a 49 percent stake in the three Mirage resorts to <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shinpan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for 433 million Australian dollars, or about $ 333.4 million. At the time, <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> said that new resorts were planned for southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The announcement Monday did n't say if the Japanese companies would acquire <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION>'s remaining stake in the resorts. The planned corporate restructuring involves the merger of <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 55 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> said this move would `` significantly reduce administrative costs.'' Before trading was suspended, <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> shares had plunged to 16 Australian cents from 33 cents Friday. The shares had traded at around 1.50 Australian dollars in March, when <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> announced the plan to acquire MGM @ <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION>. MGM @ <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 10 scrapped the agreement, saying the Australian company failed to deliver a $ 50 million letter of credit that it was supposed to supply as security in the transaction. <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> said Monday that `` group cash flow has been negatively impacted by an excess of 200 million Australian dollars'' because of four recent problems. The problems included what <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> characterized as an `` unlawful termination'' by <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> @ <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> of the acquisition pact and `` consequential impact on <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>,'' which was denied access to banking facilities after the deal dissolved. High Australian interest rates also are hurting its business, <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> said. He traced some of the troubles at the Australian Mirage resorts to a strike by domestic airline pilots. The deferral of a settlement in a previously announced sale of two <LOCATION> Queensland </LOCATION> regional TV stations also hurt, <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> said. Monday's announcement responded to the stock exchange's question about <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION>'s exposure to <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, which is 43 percent-owned by the Australian company. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affiliate owes <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> $ 38.1 million in unsecured loans. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> said it has a further investment of $ 83.3 million in <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> shares.

The reluctance has kept the dollar trading in a narrow range against other major currencies. A report on orders for durable goods is due Tuesday from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> followed Thursday by the department's first estimate of third-quarter growth in the gross national product, the government's broadest measure of economic health. The dollar also has been weighed down by speculation that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates might recede in the near future. Lower rates would reduce returns on dollar-denominated investments and tend to lessen demand for dollars. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to a closing 142.40 Japanese yen from 141.35 yen at Friday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar ended unchanged at 142.40 yen. It was quoted at 141.90 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from 142.42 yen on Friday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.5945 from $ 1.5885 late Friday. A pound cost $ 1.6030 at the end of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, compared with $ 1.5885 Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's quotes, included: 1.8470 West German marks, down from 1.8578; 1.6190 Swiss francs, down from 1.6285; 6.2740 French francs, down from 6.3105; 1.1704 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1741; and 1,356.00 Italian lire, down from 1,367.00 Late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Friday's late rates, included: 1.8550 West German marks, up from 1.8535; 1.6270 Swiss francs, up from 1.6255; 6.3050 French francs, up from 6.2962; 2.0965 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0973; 1,364.50 Italian lire, up from 1,363.65; and, 1.1720 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1732. Gold bullion fell in what dealers called one of the slowest sessions in months. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the metal fell to a late bid price of $ 365.75 a troy ounce, down from $ 366.75 bid late Friday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, gold declined to $ 365.60 bid from $ 366 bid late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 53 cents to close at $ 366.54. Silver bullion barely budged in quiet dealings and closed unchanged. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a late bid price of $ 5.09 a troy ounce, unchanged from Friday's late bid price. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $ 5.089 an ounce, the same as late Friday

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Monday offered separate proposals on how to include trade in services in the framework of the current round of negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The proposals, which will be discussed this week by representatives of the 96-member <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, aim to set guidelines on trade in such services as insurance, banking, tourism, engineering and data processing. The current <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> talks is the first to attempt to include services in its mandate to liberalize world trade. Details of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal were n't released Monday, but the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> proposal was released to reporters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> warns against adopting too broad a definition of services, saying such a move would be tantamount to `` liberalizing all investment and all labor movement.'' `` The Community does n't consider that an all-embracing, generic definition of trade in services, which stands on its own, will be feasible,'' the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that it is too difficult to develop `` unambiguous, universal criteria.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> on Monday criticized <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for maintaining what he called a `` rigged market'' that owed much of its business success to restrictive national trade policies <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, speaking to more than 600 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, specifically complained about critical remarks by <PERSON> Akio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in the recently published book, `` The <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> That Can Say No.'' `` I resent like hell being lectured on fairness by a guy who got to be a multibillionaire in our market _ wide open to him _ while we were being systematically shut out of his,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. `` The guy even has the audacity to say that American car companies wo n't even try to sell in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Copper Hits Two-Month Low as Speculators Bail Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper speculators continued their flight from the weakening market Monday, sending copper futures prices to their lowest levels in more than two months on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. On other futures markets, heating oil plunged the 2-cents-a-gallon daily limit as energy futures sagged; stock-index futures dropped along with stock prices; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and grains and soybeans were mixed. Copper settled 0.2 cent to 4.5 cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 1.196 a pound, its lowest daily close since Aug. 16. The sell-off largely reflected selling by investment funds amid indications that the market is shifting away from the tight-supply situation that has existed since mid-summer. `` This was a complete continuation of fund liquidation,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a broker with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It was one of the quieter days that I can remember as far as trade business is concerned.'' A fundamental backdrop for the market's decline was establshed last week when miners at <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> copper mine ended a 3 -LCB- - month strike and Mexican officials indicated that the <LOCATION> Cananea </LOCATION> copper mine, that country's largest, would likely reopen soon after a two-month shutdown Analysts also traced Monday's weakness to the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s report that warehouse stocks of copper registered with the exchange had shruken by 4,800 metric tons last week, a much smaller decline than traders had expected. Precious metals futures edged lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex in dull trading. Gold settled 30 cents to 50 cents lower with December at $ 370.20 a troy ounce; silver was unchanged to 0.3 cent lower with December at $ 5.138 a troy ounce. The sharp drop in oil prices on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> was mainly a technical affair inspired by the November heating-oil contract's dip below 60 cents a gallon, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Selling accelerated after crude oil futures broke through $ 20 a barrel, a point of strong psychological support, he said. A trade journal's report of continued <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> overproduction prompted further selling. Heating oil for December delivery fell the 2-cent daily limit while the limitless November contract plungged 2.02 cents a gallon. West Texas Intermediate crude settled 8 cents to 36 cents lower with November at $ 18.59 a barrel; heating oil was 1.02 cents to 2.02 cents lower with November at 58.42 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.03 cents to 1.10 cents lower with November at 53.48 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in line with stock prices after last week's strong rally showed signs of fading. The contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 2.50 points lower at 347.95. Each point is worth $ 500. Cattle futures climbed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> following Friday's quarterly <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> cattle-on-feed report, which showed fewer cattle on feedlots than the market had expected Hog futures also advanced while frozen pork bellies retreated ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly cold-storage report, which showed 32.8 million pounds of bellies in the nation's commercial freezers as of Sept. 30 compared with 31.1 million pounds on the same date a year earlier. Live cattle futures finished .15 cent to .45 cent higher with December at 75.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .37 cent higher with October at 83.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to .82 cent higher with December at 47.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .28 cent to .37 cent lower with February at 52.57 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures closed narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with prices for near-month corn and wheat deliveries supported by export demand and other contracts weakened by harvest pressure. Wheat futures settled 2 -LCB- cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with December at $ 4.07 -RCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.41 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with December at $ 1.45 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent lower to 2 -LCB- cents higher with November at $ 5.63 a bushel

<HEAD>Mixed Bag for Oil Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Six major oil companies reported mixed quarterly results Monday, mostly because of lower gasoline prices that hurt their refining and marketing businesses. Earnings were down at <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported a net loss. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said earnings rose slightly. <ORGANIZATION> Amerada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, bucking the trend, said earnings more than doubled. Analysts said higher worldwide crude oil prices partly offset weaker refining margins due to a fall in gasoline prices. Soaring gasoline prices in the spring led to softer-than-expected demand for gasoline during the peak summer travel season, hurting refining and marketing profits for most companies. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest oil company, said it earned $ 1.1 billion or 87 cents a share in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, down 9 percent from $ 1.2 billion or 93 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue totaled $ 23.6 billion vs. $ 21.8 billion an 8 percent gain. For the first nine months, earnings fell 34.5 percent to $ 2.54 billion, or $ 1.99 a share, from $ 3.88 billion, or $ 2.89 a share. The lower nine-month earnings reflected the company's provision for the March 24 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill. Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 108 million or 39 cents a share in the third quarter, up from $ 105 million or 38 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue declined 2 percent to $ 4.8 billion from $ 4.9 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s nine-month earnings dropped 14 percent to $ 255 million or 93 cents a share, compared with $ 295 million, or $ 1.23 a share, in the same 1988 period. Revenue rose 6 percent to $ 15 billion from $ 14 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings dropped 60 percent to $ 87 million, or 36 cents a share, from $ 215 million, or 89 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue for the <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, company rose 7 percent to $ 3.1 billion from $ 2.9 billion. For the nine months, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> earned $ 474 million or $ 1.95 a share, down 8 percent from $ 515 million or $ 2.17 a share a year earlier. Revenue dropped 10 percent to $ 9.5 billion from $ 8.6 billion a year earlier. Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 379 million, or $ 2.19 a share in the quarter, down 3 percent from $ 391 million or $ 2.17 a share a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>'s revenue totaled $ 3.7 billion, down 20 percent from $ 4.6 billion in the 1988 third quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>'s nine-month earnings rose 33 percent to $ 1.6 billion, or $ 8.87 share, compared with $ 1.2 billion, or $ 6.56 a share, a year earlier, while revenue declined 13 percent to $ 12 billion from $ 13.8 billion in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, reporting its fourth-quarter results, said it lost $ 39.4 million or 71 cents a share due to previously announced charges of $ 78 million. Revenue rose to $ 2.3 billion from $ 2.2 billion. For the fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings totaled $ 86.2 million or $ 1.55 a share, down from $ 224 million or $ 4.01 a share a year earlier. Revenue grew about 4 percent to $ 8.5 billion from $ 8.2 billion as year ago. New York-based <PERSON> Amerada </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>'s third-quarter earnings jumped to $ 51.8 million, or 64 cents a share, from $ 15.8 million, or 20 cents a share, reflecting much stronger refining and marketing segments that bucked the general trend in the industry. The company also benefited from unused tax credits of years past. The third-quarter results included a charge of $ 30 million, associated with expenses from a refinery shutdown in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> during Hurricane Hugo. <PERSON> Amerada </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>'s third-quarter revenue rose to $ 1.2 billion, up 28 percent from $ 925 million in the same 1988 period. <PERSON> Amerada </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>' nine-month earnings jumped to $ 406 million, or $ 4.99 a share, from $ 57.9 million, or 71 cents a share. Revenue totaled $ 4 billion, up 35 percent from $ 3.1 billion in 1988.

 Oil futures prices fell in relatively light trading Monday led by a sharp fall in heating oil prices. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for domestic heating oil finished 2.02 cents lower at 58.42 cents a gallon and the contract for delivery in December closed at 58.84 a gallon, down 2 cents. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for November delivery ended 1.03 cents lower at 53.48 cents a gallon, while the December contract declined 1.10 cents to settled at 52.78 cents a gallon.

 <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will continue exploring ways to get the best deal for its shareholders and indicated it may not accept anything less than the $ 6.75 billion offered by a labor-management group which failed to get financing for a buyout. In a vague statement, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said it considered the failed bid's price of $ 300 a share to be `` an attractive offer'' and `` in the best interests of shareholders.'' `` Consistent with the effort to maximize shareholder value, the board will continue to explore all strategic and financial alternatives available to the company,'' <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> said. `` However, the board has concluded that, at this time, the welfare of the company, its shareholders, its employees and the broader public served by the airline can best be enhanced by continued development of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> as a strong, viable, independent company.'' The company issued the statement late in the day after a special board meeting had ended. The statement also contained an ambiguous statement from <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, who had joined with the company's 7,000 pilots in leading the buyout group. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said the cooperative effort had helped management and the pilots to forge a `` substantially improved working relationship.'' But he made no mention in the statement of the group's recent efforts to revise its offer. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said he `` hopes that all 70,000 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> employees can now turn their full attention to operating the best airline in the world.'' Published reports had indicated the battered buyout group would bring a new proposal to the board Monday while others said the group wanted to secure financing before putting another offer on the table. Spokespersons for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the flight attendants all declined comment on the status of their efforts to put together another bid. A $ 300-a-share bid valued at $ 6.75 billion collapsed Oct. 13 when key banks refused to provide financing. The Wall Street Journal reported that the labor-managment group was considering a revised offer that would give employees a majority stake in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> and leave some stock in public hands. The Journal said the group was seeking reactions to the new deal, valued at $ 225 to $ 240 a share, or about $ 5.09 billion. The newspaper said the group did not plan to formally present the scheme at the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board meeting but would seek binding commitments from banks covering all the money needed to finance the buyout before making a formal proposal. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported that the employee-management group intended to submit a revised proposal to the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board Monday. The offer for Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> will be in the range of $ 220 to $ 250 a share, the newspapers said, quoting unidentified sources. The Association of Flight Attendants told its members in a recorded phone-in message that any revised proposal `` will obviously be considerably lower'' than the unsuccessful deal. The failure of the earlier bid helped trigger a 190-point plunge in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average on Oct. 13 and precipitated a 40 percent drop in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock closed last Friday at $ 168.50 a share. But the stock rebounded Monday morning as the board meeting began and was trading at $ 182 at midday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The flight attendants joined the pilots and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s top management in the bid on Thursday. The original deal would have given management and labor an 85 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> under the largest employee buyout in corporate history. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which pulled out of the buyout group on Friday, would have taken a 15 percent ownership stake in return for a $ 750 million investment.

<HEAD>Reports Loss for Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it lost $ 176 million in the third quarter due to huge expenses associated with its acquisition of a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The loss amounted to $ 2.88 per share on revenue of $ 2.2 billion. A year ago, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> alone earned $ 81 million, or $ 1.42 a share, on revenue of $ 1.13 billion. Those figures are not directly comparable, however, with the latest results reflecting <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition in late July of 100 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock, boosting its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to 59.3 percent. The latest results also reflect a pro-rated share of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings for August and September. For the first nine months of the year, the newly configured entertainment and media giant known now as <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 33 million, or 56 cents per share, on revenue of $ 4.5 billion. Time alone earned $ 231 million, or $ 4 a share, on revenue of $ 3.3 billion a year ago. The <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> loss in the latest quarter reflects a jump in interest expense to $ 451 million from $ 25 million for Time alone in 1988, as well as depreciation and amortization charges of $ 155 million compared with $ 55 million a year earlier. The company said that for purposes of discussion, it computed earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the new company. Under that method, it said its pro-forma earnings amounted to $ 526 million for the quarter, up from $ 242 million a year earlier, and to $ 1.52 billion for the nine months, up from $ 999 million. Magazine division earnings on a pro-forma basis fell to $ 41 million in the latest quarter from $ 47 million a year earlier, as advertising revenues were flat. The filmed entertainment division had pro-forma earnings of $ 103 million in the quarter in contrast to a loss of $ 123 million last year, reflecting the success of `` Batman'' and `` Lethal Weapon II.'' On the same pro-forma basis, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s recorded music and music publishing division earned $ 108 million, up from $ 92 million a year earlier, and cable division earnings rocketed to $ 166 million from $ 94 million. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> expects to complete the acquisition of the remaining shares of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock later this year, paying for a package that includes preferred stock and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s holdings in a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will not offer any more money to settle a three-week strike by production workers despite mounting and `` irreparable'' losses, Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> told reporters Monday. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, said the strike could not be settled without a bigger money offer. The separate news conferences, including the first by <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> in the dispute, appeared to mark a hardening of positions in the 20th day of a walkout at the world's largest commercial airplane manufacturer. Four hours of talks Wednesday were the first since union members voted by an 85 percent margin to strike rather than accept the company's a three-year offer. That offer included annual pay increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3 percent in the second; cost-of-living increases to cover inflation; a 20 percent reduction in mandatory overtime; and higher benefits. No further talks were scheduled. The Machinists represent 57,800 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers nationwide, including 43,300 in the local district, 12,000 in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and a few hundred at scattered sites in other states. At <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, a non-union <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> worker and two others were released on bond after being arrested early Saturday in the firing of a shotgun at the union's strike headquarters. Pellets hit the building, parked cars and a sign, but no one was injured. <LOCATION> Sedgwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies said charges could be filed within 14 days. Picketing has been generally quiet in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area. The last paychecks for work done before the walkout were mailed by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> last week. The first union strike payments of a flat $ 100 per week per member are set for distribution Thursday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said union members were adamant about getting a bigger financial package, with less than 1 percent crossing picket lines and fewer total crossing than in the last <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> strike, in 1977. At his news conference, <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> maintained the package was the best in recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial history and said any boost would jeopardize <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s competitive position. `` We're not prepared to increase the offer,'' <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> said he hoped the dispute would not jeopardize <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term labor relations, generally regarded as among the best in the aerospace industry `` I do n't think I've drawn a line that is unreasonable,'' he said. Contacted by telephone after <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> spoke, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he did n't consider that the company's last word `` They have their own timing on when they want to settle the strike,'' the union leader said, adding that he did not know what that timetable might be. <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> already faced unspecified losses, including sales, on which he gave no figures or other indication of magnitude. `` We certainly are not ignoring this strike. We certainly want to see it settled as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> said. `` I think our losses are irreparable already.'' Meanwhile, contract talks with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest union, the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, were set to resume Tuesday and continue through the week, said <PERSON> Robbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miner </PERSON> of the unaffiliated union.

<HEAD>OSHA Issues Citations, Fine Against Cargill Poultry-Processing Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal agency on Monday announced citations against <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Buena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, poultry-processing plant, alleging 113 willful violations of federal safety and health standards. The <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> also proposed a $ 242,000 fine against <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> over the alleged violations. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scannell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary of labor, said the plant did not implement controls to reduce cumulative trauma disorders in its workers. The disorders, known as CDTs, include carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauser </PERSON>, a spokesman at <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, - based <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION>, said the company plans to contest the citations and fine `` At this time <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> has not discussed the detailed factual findings of its investigation,'' he said, reading from a statement. `` Therefore, the company will contest the proposed citation and fine so it can review <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s findings.'' CDTs result from constant repetition of awkward or forced hand and arm action and result in aching wrists and numb fingers and hands. In some cases, permanent damage can be caused to tendons, nerves and muscles. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> records indicate 90 percent of the <LOCATION> Buena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> plant's 500 employees work at tasks that expose them to risk from CDTs. `` We believe the pervasiveness of CDT in the plant, affecting upwards of an estimated two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> employees, and the lack of a concerted effort by the company to implement corrective actions justify the multi-instance penalties,'' <PERSON> Scannell </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> found 111 CDT violations and cited the plant for not having an effective program to battle CDTs and for failing to provide employees' medical records. <PERSON> Lauser </PERSON> said the company `` has made serious good-faith efforts to address CDT problems,'' including hiring medical experts and providing job rotations.

<HEAD>West Virginia Charges Five Investment Houses With Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> charged five New York-based investment houses with fraud and conspiracy Monday over the loss of $ 279 million in the state consolidated investment fund in 1987-89. The suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> Kanwha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, came after the state obtained a related injunction against the five firms and three others. The injunction was sought after five of the brokerage houses filed suit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday to prevent the state from suing them in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> court. A hearing on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> petition is scheduled for Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The legal actions amounted to pre-emptive strikes by both sides as they maneuver on the complicated issues of whether the brokerage firms are responsible for trading losses that the state suffered primarily in April-June 1987 in the consolidated investment fund. The losses led to the resignation of state Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>. The five brokerage houses did not believe they were responsible for any trading losses in the fund nor were they liable for damages, Attorney General <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> told the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the fund. The five are <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc; <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> filed a 69-page legal action against the five Monday evening in <ORGANIZATION> Kanawha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, charging them in a 10-count civil action with actions that were `` reckless, willful, wanton and malicious and exhibited conscious indifference to their consequences Before the five sued the state, <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> warned them they would be arguing their case before a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> jury. Shortly thereafter, they sued in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court to prevent the state from suing them in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> court. As a result of that suit, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> filed suit Monday in <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> against the five, plus <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fenner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The latter three were added to preclude them from filing action in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, officials at the attorney general's office said. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> MacQueen </PERSON> issued a preliminary injunction on the state's petition to halt the eight from filing legal action to prevent the state from suing them. He said the suit and countersuit means the two sides are at a legal standstill. <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> later Molnday filed the new suit, which seeks unspecified damage against the investment houses for their handling of state investments in the loss period of 1987-89. It charged the companies with fraud, conspiracy, negligence, violation of financial trust and illegal speculative trading. The fund lost $ 279 million directly and up to $ 340 million when future interest losses are included, according to a report by a special prosecutor. The fund, comprised of money from state, county and municipal governments, was invested by the treasurer's office.
